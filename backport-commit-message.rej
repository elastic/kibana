**Commit 1:**
[internal] Replace var with let in ui/public/vislib

This change was applied to all .js files under src/ui/public/vislib.

This was an automatic replacement from var to let for any variable
declaration that doubles as the initial assignment. Ultimately we want
most of these to be converted to const, but this commit is so large that
it warrants breaking each step of automation up into its own commit.

For example:

`var foo = 'bar';` becomes `let foo = 'var';`

This was accomplished by replacing:
find: `var ([a-zA-Z_$][0-9a-zA-Z_$]*)(\s+)=`
replace: `let $1$2=`
