**Commit 1:**
Upgrades Hapi to 14.2.0

As of Node 6, crypto.pbkdf emits a deprecation warning when the digest isn't explicily set. Under certain conditions we are seeing this warning from Hapi's dependency Iron. Iron resolved this issue as of 4.0.4, which was introduced into Hapi as of 14.0.0.

Node deprecation: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4047/commits/8e8959d3ee0bfe48b5f4d239e7f031a1a27708f0
Iron's resolution: https://github.com/hueniverse/iron/pull/43/commits/9e0a1ef5927c707fc79c5f2fa8c69a4b956897a4

As of Hapi v9, they have removed three build-in plugins from the core which we rely on inert (files and directories), vision (view templates), and h2o2 (proxy). https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/2682
