**Commit 1:**
[internal] Replace empty var declaration with let

Any time there is a variable defined in a JS file without also storing a
value in it, we know that definition cannot be converted to a const, so
we convert it to a let.

For example:

`var blah;` becomes `let blah;`

Some of these things variables might be unused, and many others can
likely be switched to const with only minor refactoring, but the commit
is very large, so there are no changes in it other than the 1:1 switch.
