**Commit 1:**
Apply -snapshot suffix during build task

The default behavior of the build task is to now apply the -snapshot
suffix dynamically rather than us manually hardcoding and managing it
within the source code itself. The `--release` flag will drop the
-snapshot suffix on a build, which should be used for any release
candidate.

The default behavior of the build task has also changed to create
rpm/deb packages as well. Since we've only confirmed that this works on
linux, you can override that behavior by passing `skip-os-packages`.

If you do not want to create any zip or tar.gz archives, you can pass
`--skip-archives`.
