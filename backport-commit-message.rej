Tag Cloud should deal with empty responses correctly

Backports PR #9354

**Commit 1:**
Tag Cloud should deal with empty responses correctly

tag cloud did not work with empty responses correctly. One of the side-effects is that the back button did not work properly. For example, pressing the back button would not empty out the screen and show stale clouds.

This also caused a type-error. Empty configurations meant that we could not access any aggregation-configs to produce a label.
