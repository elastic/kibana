Grid isolate scope

Backports PR #10074

**Commit 1:**
Dashboard clean up

- Stop storing the grid element on the panel which caused a circular
reference and required special code to make it serializable.
- Call state.save directly rather than broadcasting change:vis

This is in prep for possibly making grid scope isolate and view/edit
mode implementation.
