**Commit 9:**
[chrome] rework url overflow detection

The previous version of this pr relied on the State service to catch times when the URL would grow out of control. While overflows will commonly occur in the State service, this didn't handle urls that were navigated to using a link. They worked because the state service would eventually be called, but the failure was unexpected and required interaction to trigger.

This new approach does the checking at a higher level, in the chrome.

We also removed the `url:limit` configuration value in favor of browser detection (I was not able to find or come up with a way to quietly and quickly feature detect this). The new limits are 2000 characters for IE and 25000 for all other browsers.
