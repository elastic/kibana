**Commit 2:**
code review comments

- Get rid of top nav config factory function refactor as it makes the
parameters less clear.
- Remove the watch on topNavMenu since it isnâ€™t necessary for this PR.
Will bring a better variation back in the view/edit mode PR.

Note that these changes look somewhat pointless in and of themselves,
but the refactor will be useful for the view/edit mode when the top nav
configuration will change based on the dashboard mode, and then the
refactored functions, which are all only being used one currently, will
be called multiple times.
