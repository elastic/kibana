Pretty handling of logarithmic axes.
Copyright (c) 2007-2014 IOLA and Ole Laursen.
Licensed under the MIT license.
Created by Arne de Laat
Set axis.mode to "log" and make the axis logarithmic using transform:
    axis: {
        mode: 'log',
        transform: function(v) {v <= 0 ? Math.log(v) / Math.LN10 : null},
        inverseTransform: function(v) {Math.pow(10, v)}
    }
The transform filters negative and zero values, because those are
invalid on logarithmic scales.
This plugin tries to create good looking logarithmic ticks, using
unicode superscript characters. If all data to be plotted is between two
powers of ten then the default flot tick generator and renderer are
used. Logarithmic ticks are places at powers of ten and at half those
values if there are not to many ticks already (e.g. [1, 5, 10, 50, 100]).
