Kibana is a TypeScript code base. Provide examples or suggestions in TypeScript whenever possible.

Ensure that:

* any string value that looks like it is an HTTP API path is in snake case. For example, `/api/myDomain/myApi` should be `/api/my_domain/my_api`, `/internal/myRoute` should be `/internal/my_route`.

Make suggestions about how to fix the problem.
