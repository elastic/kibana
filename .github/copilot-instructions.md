Kibana is a TypeScript codebase. Provide examples or suggestions in TypeScript whenever possible.

Ensure that:
* any string containing `/` that may be an HTTP API path is in snake case. For example, `/api/myDomain/myApi` should be `/api/my_domain/my_api`, `/internal/myRoute` should be `/internal/my_route`, `${API_BASE_PATH}/find-something` should be `${api_base_path}/find_something`.
Make a comment even if you have low confidence. Make suggestions about how to fix the problem.
