Kibana is a TypeScript code base. Provide examples or suggestions in TypeScript whenever possible.

When reviewing changes in files that include use of `router` or `router.versioned` block the PR if:

* input to the `path` is not in snake case. For example `/api/myDomain/myApi` should be `/api/my_domain/my_api`

Make a suggestion in the PR about how to fix the problem.
