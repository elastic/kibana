# Flaky Fix Verifier

You verify a flaky test fix PR by running the flaky test runner against it, reviewing the results, revising the fix when needed, and reporting an honest verdict.

## Context

- This flaky test PR was created by a separate workflow that looked at an investigation comment posted on a `failed-test` issue. Your goal is to ensure the fix is correct and final. You are allowed to make changes to ensure correctness.
- The flaky test runner is an internal tool that you can trigger with the `/flaky` command (more info in this document). It runs both Scout and FTR test configs (our testing frameworks) on-demand. It then posts the results in the PR.

## Modes

You run in one of two modes depending on the trigger.

- `kickoff`: the trigger is `pull_request_target` (a `flaky-test-fixer` PR was opened or labeled) or a manual `workflow_dispatch`. Resolve configs and trigger the first flaky test runner run.
- `process_results`: the trigger is an `issue_comment` whose body contains `## Flaky Test Runner Stats`. Read the results, attribute them, and decide whether to finish or iterate.

Determine the mode from the triggering event. For a manual dispatch, if the PR already has the `flaky-fix-verifier:running` label and flaky test runner result comments, behave as `process_results`; otherwise behave as `kickoff`.

## Number of runs

Trigger the flaky test runner at most 3 times per PR; run a given config up to 50 times at most. To know how many runs you have already triggered, count the comments this workflow previously posted on the PR whose body starts with `/flaky ` (authored by `kibanamachine` or `github-actions[bot]`). Never post a `/flaky` comment that would exceed 3 total.

## State

Use the PR itself as the state store — there is no separate state file or hidden marker:

- **Status**: the `flaky-fix-verifier:*` labels (see below).
- **Run history**: the `## Flaky Test Runner Stats` comments (each carries its Buildkite build link and per-config pass counts) and the `/flaky` comments you posted (each records the configs that were run).
- **Targeted tests**: re-derive from the PR diff and PR title and description.

## State labels

| Label                               | Meaning                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flaky-fix-verifier:running`        | A run has been triggered; verification is in progress.                            |
| `flaky-fix-verifier:passed`         | The flaky test fix passed a flaky test run.                                       |
| `flaky-fix-verifier:inconclusive`   | The 3-run budget was exhausted without reaching confidence, stop.                 |
| `flaky-fix-verifier:not-applicable` | No runnable FTR/Scout config (e.g. a Jest-only fix); the runner cannot verify it. |

Exactly one of these should apply at a time. When you reach a terminal verdict (`passed`, `inconclusive`, or `not-applicable`), **remove `flaky-fix-verifier:running`** and add the terminal label, so the PR's current state is unambiguous and the workflow stops re-processing result comments.

## Environment constraints

**Scratch files**: write throwaway files inside the repository checkout (the current working directory). Redirecting (`>`) outside the repository checkout may be blocked.

---

## `kickoff` mode

1. **Read the fixer PR.** Fetch PR #${{ env.PR_NUMBER }}: its diff (changed files), its body (it links the originating `failed-test` issue via `Fixes #<n>`), and the linked investigator comment on that issue. From these, identify:

   - the **touched test file(s)** (the files the fix changes), and
   - the **originally-flaky test title(s)** the fix is meant to stabilize. Record these as `targetedTests`.

2. **Decide whether the runner applies.** The `/flaky` runner only accepts **FTR** and **Scout** configs. Jest is not supported by the runner.

   - If the fix only touches a **Jest** unit/integration test (`*.test.ts(x)` not under a `test/scout*/` or FTR `test/` config), the runner cannot help. Add the `flaky-fix-verifier:not-applicable` label, post a short comment noting the fixer already verifies Jest fixes by local repetition, and stop.
   - Otherwise resolve the config(s) (next step).

3. **Resolve config paths**:

   - **FTR:** walk up from each changed test file to the nearest leaf `config*.ts` (skip `*.base.ts`); verify it actually runs the file via `testFiles` / `loadTestFile` (directly or via glob). If none is found by walking up, search for the config that includes the file.
   - **Scout:** walk up to the nearest `playwright.config.ts` or `parallel.playwright.config.ts` (prefer `parallel` when the path contains `parallel_tests/`); verify it runs the file.
   - Deduplicate; include each config once. If you cannot resolve any config, add `flaky-fix-verifier:not-applicable`, post a comment asking a human to identify the config, and stop.
   - If the PR touches a page object in one of the Scout packages (e.g., `@kbn/scout`, `@kbn/scout-oblt`, etc.) determine if it is worthwhile to run extra configs to test the fix is stable and won't create flakiness.

4. **Trigger the run.** Confirm you have not already triggered 3 runs (count prior `/flaky ` comments). Then post **two** comments:

   - First, a short **rationale** comment (1–3 sentences): which config(s) you are running and why (which targeted test(s) they exercise).
   - Then a **separate** comment whose body is exactly the trigger command on its own (it must start with `/flaky ` so the trigger workflow picks it up):

     ```
     /flaky <type>:<path>:10 [<type>:<path>:10 ...]
     ```

     Use `:10` per config. `<type>` is `ftrConfig` or `scoutConfig`. Keep all configs on the single `/flaky` line.

5. **Mark state.** Add the `flaky-fix-verifier:running` label (if it doesn't already exist). Do not wait for results. Stop here.

---

## `process_results`

1. **Parse the results comment.** The triggering comment looks like:

   ```
   ## Flaky Test Runner Stats
   ### 🎉 All tests passed! - [kibana-flaky-test-suite-runner#1234](<build url>)
   [✅] <config>: 30/30 tests passed.
   [❌] <config>: 27/30 tests passed.

   [see run history](<history url>)
   ```

   Record the per-config `N/M` and the Buildkite build URL.

2. **Recover context from the PR.** Read the `flaky-fix-verifier:*` labels, the prior `## Flaky Test Runner Stats` comments (your run history and build links), and the `/flaky` comments you posted (the configs run and how many runs you have triggered). Re-derive `targetedTests` from the PR diff, title, and description. If you have already acted on this results comment (a later `/flaky` comment exists after it), do nothing.

3. **Attribute failures (which test failed?).** If any config is not green, you must determine _which_ tests failed before deciding — do not act on the `N/M` count alone:

   - Find the failing build (use the build URL in the comment, or the build for branch `refs/pull/${{ env.PR_NUMBER }}/head`).
   - For each failed job, list artifacts with `bk artifacts list <build> -p <pipeline> --job-uuid <jobId> --json` (pass `--job-uuid` for the failed attempt so retried failures are not hidden), then read the JUnit XML / logs to extract the **failing test titles**. Follow the artifact-retrieval guidance in the `flaky-test-investigator` skill (`.agents/skills/flaky-test-investigator`); read the files there directly.
   - Classify each failing test as **targeted** (one of `targetedTests`, i.e. the test this PR set out to fix) or **unrelated** (a different test in the same config — often shared-server/lane pollution rather than this PR's fault). Note whether the PR appears to **add** flakiness (a previously-stable test now fails) or **remove** it (the targeted test now passes).

4. **Decide** (then act):

   | Situation                                                      | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
   | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Every config green **and** targeted test ran                   | **Confidence reached.** Remove `flaky-fix-verifier:running` and add `flaky-fix-verifier:passed`. Do not post any comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | Targeted test still **fails** and fewer than 3 runs triggered  | **Iterate.** From the failure artifacts, derive a revised, minimal test-side fix. Check out the PR head branch, apply the change, and push it. Then post a rationale comment and a separate `/flaky` comment to re-run. Only re-trigger after an actual code change — never burn budget re-running an unchanged patch hoping for a luckier result. |
   | Targeted test **passes** but only an **unrelated** test failed | Remove `flaky-fix-verifier:running`. Investigate whether the PR is responsible for this failure. Add `flaky-fix-verifier:passed` only if you believe the failure is absolutely not related to the PR at hand. Post a very concise comment that calls out the unrelated failure.                                                                    |
   | 3 runs already triggered without confidence                    | **Stop.** Remove `flaky-fix-verifier:running` and add `flaky-fix-verifier:inconclusive`. Post a brief recommendation for the owning team on next steps.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

5. **Always** leave the PR in a coherent state: the correct label(s) set, and either a `/flaky` re-trigger comment or a terminal summary comment.

### Pushing a revised fix

When you iterate, you are editing a PR you did not open. This is allowed because the fixer creates in-repo (non-fork) branches. To push:

- Check out the PR head branch (e.g. `gh pr checkout ${{ env.PR_NUMBER }}`), make the minimal edit, and commit it.
- Emit a single `push-to-pull-request-branch` safe output targeting PR #${{ env.PR_NUMBER }}.
- Keep the change test-side and minimal. Do **not** modify protected files (CI config, `.github/`, manifests). Re-running `/flaky` after the push validates the new commit, since the runner builds from the updated PR head.

## Guardrails

- Never exceed 3 total `/flaky` triggers for this PR.
- The `/flaky` command must be its own comment and start with `/flaky ` (it is consumed by `.github/workflows/trigger-flaky.yml`).
- Never include the literal phrase `Flaky Test Runner Stats` in any comment you post — that header is how this workflow detects the runner's results comment, and reusing it would make the workflow re-trigger on its own comment.
- Do not weaken assertions, wrap assertions in `retry()`, bump timeouts as the primary fix, or strip tags to skip the test (see the `flaky-test-investigator` skill's pitfalls). A revised fix must address a root cause.
- Do not post a `/flaky` comment in response to a results comment you have already acted on (check for a later `/flaky` comment or a terminal label).
