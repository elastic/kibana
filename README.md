- We also offer a hosted version of Kibana on our
[Cloud Service](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/as-a-service).

### Building and Running Kibana, and/or Contributing Code

You might want to build Kibana locally to contribute some code, test out the latest features, or try
out an open PR:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) will help you get Kibana up and running.
- If you would like to contribute code, please follow our [STYLEGUIDE.md](STYLEGUIDE.md).

### Snapshot Builds

For the daring, snapshot builds are available. These builds are created nightly and have undergone no formal QA, so they should never be run in production. All builds are 64 bit.

## Documentation

For information about building the documentation, see the README in [elastic/docs](https://github.com/elastic/docs).

## Version Compatibility with Elasticsearch

Ideally, you should be running Elasticsearch and Kibana with matching version numbers. If your Elasticsearch has an older version number or a newer _major_ number than Kibana, then Kibana will fail to run. If Elasticsearch has a newer minor or patch number than Kibana, then the Kibana Server will log a warning.

_Note: The version numbers below are only examples, meant to illustrate the relationships between different types of version numbers._

| Situation                 | Example Kibana version     | Example ES version | Outcome |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |------------------- | ------- |
| Versions are the same.    | 5.1.2                      | 5.1.2              | üíö OK      |
| ES patch number is newer. | 5.1.__2__                  | 5.1.__5__          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Logged warning      |
| ES minor number is newer. | 5.__1__.2                  | 5.__5__.0          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Logged warning      |
| ES major number is newer. | __5__.1.2                  | __6__.0.0          | üö´ Fatal error      |
| ES patch number is older. | 5.1.__2__                  | 5.1.__0__          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Logged warning      |
| ES minor number is older. | 5.__1__.2                  | 5.__0__.0          | üö´ Fatal error      |
| ES major number is older. | __5__.1.2                  | __4__.0.0          | üö´ Fatal error      |
