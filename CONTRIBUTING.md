# Contributing to Kibana

If you are an employee at Elastic, please check out our Developer Guide [here](https://docs.elastic.dev/kibana-dev-docs/welcome).

If you are an external developer, we have a legacy developer guide [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/development.html), or you can view the raw docs from our new, internal Developer Guide [here](./dev_docs/getting_started/dev_welcome.mdx). Eventually, our internal Developer Guide will be opened for public consumption.
