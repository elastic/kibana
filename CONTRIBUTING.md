# Contributing to Kibana

We understand that you may not have days at a time to work on Kibana. We ask that you read our [developer guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/development.html) carefully so that you spend less time, overall, struggling to push your PR through our code review processes.

Our developer guide is written in asciidoc and located under [./docs/developer](./docs/developer) if you want to make edits or access it in raw form.
