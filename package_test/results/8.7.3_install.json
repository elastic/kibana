        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating UAC Bypass via Windows Firewall Snap-In Hijack\n\nWindows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as low to high integrity levels) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. UAC can deny an operation under high-integrity enforcement, or allow the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and enter an administrator password when prompted.\n\nFor more information about the UAC and how it works, check the [official Microsoft docs page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works).\n\nThis rule identifies attempts to bypass User Account Control (UAC) by hijacking the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Windows Firewall snap-in. Attackers bypass UAC to stealthily execute code with elevated permissions.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze any suspicious spawned processes using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

They allow the victim to resume business by performing data recovery, making them a valuable target.\n\nAttackers can delete backups from the host and gain access to backup servers to remove centralized backups for the environment, ensuring that victims have no alternatives to paying the ransom.\n\nThis rule identifies file deletions performed by a process that does not belong to the backup suite and aims to delete Veritas or Veeam backups.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check if any files on the host machine have been encrypted.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This rule can be triggered by the manual removal of backup files and by removal using other third-party tools that are not from the backup suite.

It verifies users logging on to a Windows computer or server, handles password changes, and creates access tokens.\n\nAdversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in LSASS process memory. After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory. This is meant to facilitate single sign-on (SSO) ensuring a user isn’t prompted each time resource access is requested. These credential materials can be harvested by an adversary using administrative user or SYSTEM privileges to conduct lateral movement using [alternate authentication material](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/).\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- There should be very few or no false positives for this rule. If this activity is expected or noisy in your environment, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and command line conditions.\n- If the process is related to antivirus or endpoint detection and response solutions, validate that it is installed on the correct path and signed with the company's valid digital signature.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Scope compromised credentials and disable the accounts.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\nEnsure advanced audit policies for Windows are enabled, specifically:\nObject Access policies [Event ID 4656](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4656) (Handle to an Object was Requested)\n\n```\nComputer Configuration >\nPolicies >\nWindows Settings >\nSecurity Settings >\nAdvanced Audit Policies Configuration >\nSystem Audit Policies >\nObject Access >\nAudit File System (Success,Failure)\nAudit Handle Manipulation (Success,Failure)\n```\n\nAlso, this event generates only if the object’s [SACL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists) has the required access control entry (ACE) to handle the use of specific access rights.\n\nIf enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.",

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate abnormal behaviors observed by the subject process, such as registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- As trusted developer utilities have dual-use purposes, alerts derived from this rule are not essentially malicious. If these utilities are contacting internal or known trusted domains, review their security and consider creating exceptions if the domain is safe.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified.

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Potential Antimalware Scan Interface Bypass via PowerShell\n\nPowerShell is one of the main tools system administrators use for automation, report routines, and other tasks. This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nThe Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is a versatile interface standard that allows your applications and services to integrate with any antimalware product on a machine. AMSI integrates with multiple Windows components, ranging from User Account Control (UAC) to VBA macros and PowerShell.\n\nThis rule identifies scripts that contain methods and classes that can be abused to bypass AMSI.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Determine whether the script was executed and capture relevant information, such as arguments that reveal intent or are indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate commands and scripts executed after this activity was observed.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe:\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating SUNBURST Command and Control Activity\n\nSUNBURST is a trojanized version of a digitally signed SolarWinds Orion plugin called SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll. The plugin contains a backdoor that communicates via HTTP to third-party servers. After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, SUNBURST may retrieve and execute commands that instruct the backdoor to transfer files, execute files, profile the system, reboot the system, and disable system services. The malware's network traffic attempts to blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity by imitating the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol, and the malware stores persistent state data within legitimate plugin configuration files. The backdoor uses multiple obfuscated blocklists to identify processes, services, and drivers associated with forensic and anti-virus tools.\n\nMore details on SUNBURST can be found on the [Mandiant Report](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/sunburst-additional-technical-details).\n\nThis rule identifies suspicious network connections that attempt to blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity by imitating the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol behavior.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0.

This can happen by running commands to enumerate network resources, users, connections, files, and installed security software.\n\nThis rule looks for the enumeration of privileged local groups' membership by suspicious processes, and excludes known legitimate utilities and programs installed. Attackers can use this information to decide the next steps of the attack, such as mapping targets for credential compromise and other post-exploitation activities.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the process, host and user involved on the event.\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Discovery activities are not inherently malicious if they occur in isolation. As long as the analyst did not identify suspicious activity related to the user or host, such alerts can be dismissed.\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and command line conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\nThe 'Audit Security Group Management' audit policy must be configured (Success).\nSteps to implement the logging policy with with Advanced Audit Configuration:\n\n```\nComputer Configuration >\nPolicies >\nWindows Settings >\nSecurity Settings >\nAdvanced Audit Policies Configuration >\nAudit Policies >\nAccount Management >\nAudit Security Group Management (Success)\n```\n\nMicrosoft introduced the [event used](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4799) in this detection rule on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 or later operating systems.\n\nIf enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.",

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze any suspicious spawned processes using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

It enables the management of network settings and adapters, wireless network profiles, and other network-related tasks.\n\nThis rule looks for patterns used to dump credentials from wireless network profiles using Netsh, which can enable attackers to bring their own devices to the network.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe:\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately.

Windows Update Orchestrator Service was vulnerable to elevation of privileges (any user to local system) due to an improper authorization of the callers. The vulnerability affected the Windows 10 and Windows Server Core products. Fixed by Microsoft on Patch Tuesday June 2020.\n\nThis rule will detect uncommon processes spawned by `svchost.exe` with `UsoSvc` as the command line parameters. Attackers can leverage this technique to elevate privileges or maintain persistence.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified.

By using this attribute, analysts can identify renamed instances that attackers can use with the intent of evading detections, application allowlists, and other security protections.\n\nAutoIt is a scripting language and tool for automating tasks on Microsoft Windows operating systems. Due to its capabilities, malicious threat actors can abuse it to create malicious scripts and distribute malware.\n\nThis rule checks for renamed instances of AutoIt, which can indicate an attempt of evading detections, application allowlists, and other security protections.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0.

UAC can deny an operation under high-integrity enforcement, or allow the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and enter an administrator password when prompted.\n\nFor more information about the UAC and how it works, check the [official Microsoft docs page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works).\n\nDuring startup, `eventvwr.exe` checks the registry value of the `HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\mscfile\\shell\\open\\command` registry key for the location of `mmc.exe`, which is used to open the `eventvwr.msc` saved console file.

This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nPowerShell also has solid capabilities to make the interaction with the Win32 API in an uncomplicated and reliable way, like the execution of inline C# code, PSReflect, Get-ProcAddress, etc.\n\nRed Team tooling and malware developers take advantage of these capabilities to develop stagers and loaders that inject payloads directly into the memory without touching the disk to circumvent file-based security protections.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Examine file or network events from the involved PowerShell process for suspicious behavior.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Check if the imported function was executed and which process it targeted.\n- Check if the injected code can be retrieved (hardcoded in the script or on command line logs).\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- PowerShell PSReflect Script - 56f2e9b5-4803-4e44-a0a4-a52dc79d57fe\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified.

However, they can also abuse signed utilities to drop these files.\n\nPowerShell is one of system administrators' main tools for automation, report routines, and other tasks. This makes it available for use in various environments and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code and perform actions. This rule correlates network and file events to detect downloads of executable and script files performed using PowerShell.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check the reputation of the domain or IP address used to host the downloaded file.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the file using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Administrators can use PowerShell legitimately to download executable and script files. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the Administrator is aware of the activity and the triage has not identified suspicious or malicious files.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Metasploit, for example, creates a service and a random pipe, and then uses the service to connect to the pipe and impersonate the service security context, which is SYSTEM.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0.

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - If any suspicious processes were found, examine the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately.

This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nPSReflect is a library that enables PowerShell to access win32 API functions in an uncomplicated way. It also helps to create enums and structs easily—all without touching the disk.\n\nAlthough this is an interesting project for every developer and admin out there, it is mainly used in the red team and malware tooling for its capabilities.\n\nDetecting the core implementation of PSReflect means detecting most of the tooling that uses Windows API through PowerShell, enabling defenders to discover tools being dropped in the environment.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.

Upon successful exploitation, an unprivileged user will escalate privileges to SYSTEM/NT AUTHORITY.\n\nThis rule detects the default execution of the PoC, which overwrites the `elevation_service.exe` DACL and copies itself to the location to escalate privileges. An attacker is able to still take over any file that is not in use (locked), which is outside the scope of this rule.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0.

Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise.\n\nThis rule looks for processes outside known legitimate program locations communicating with a list of services that can be abused for exfiltration or command and control.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Verify whether the digital signature exists in the executable.\n- Identify the operation type (upload, download, tunneling, etc.).\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This rule has a high chance to produce false positives because it detects communication with legitimate services. Noisy false positives can be added as exceptions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Deviations from this baseline can indicate malicious activity, such as masquerading and deserve further investigation.\n\nThis rule identifies a potential malicious process masquerading as `wermgr.exe` or `WerFault.exe`, by looking for a process creation with no arguments followed by a network connection.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0.

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts.

This rule detects the occurrence of traffic on the Kerberos port (88) by processes other than `lsass.exe` to detect the unusual request and usage of Kerberos tickets.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0.

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check if the Destination IP is related to a Domain Controller.\n- Review event ID 4769 for suspicious ticket requests.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts.

HTTP traffic on a non-standard port or destination IP address unrelated to Domain controllers can create false positives.\n- Exceptions can be added for noisy/frequent connections.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n  - Ticket requests can be used to investigate potentially compromised accounts.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

By using this attribute, analysts can identify renamed instances that attackers can use with the intent of evading detections, application allowlists, and other security protections.\n\nThe Microsoft Build Engine is a platform for building applications. This engine, also known as MSBuild, provides an XML schema for a project file that controls how the build platform processes and builds software, and can be abused to proxy execution of code.\n\nThis rule checks for renamed instances of MSBuild, which can indicate an attempt of evading detections, application allowlists, and other security protections.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0.

The service manages print jobs by loading printer drivers, receiving files to be printed, queuing them, scheduling, etc.\n\nThe Print Spooler service has some known vulnerabilities that attackers can abuse to escalate privileges to SYSTEM, like CVE-2020-1048 and CVE-2020-1337. This rule looks for unusual processes writing SPL files to the location `?:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\PRINTERS\\`, which is an essential step in exploiting these vulnerabilities.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this activity is expected and noisy in your environment, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of process executable and file conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Ensure that the machine has the latest security updates and is not running legacy Windows versions.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

The client can then make multiple requests to modify, query the configuration, or start and stop services on the server by using the same session until the session is terminated.\n\nThis rule detects the remote creation or start of a service by correlating a `services.exe` network connection and the spawn of a child process.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0.

This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nAttackers can abuse PowerShell in-memory capabilities to inject executables into memory without touching the disk, bypassing file-based security protections. These executables are generally base64 encoded.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the script using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Suspicious .NET Reflection via PowerShell - e26f042e-c590-4e82-8e05-41e81bd822ad\n- PowerShell Suspicious Payload Encoded and Compressed - 81fe9dc6-a2d7-4192-a2d8-eed98afc766a\n- PowerShell PSReflect Script - 56f2e9b5-4803-4e44-a0a4-a52dc79d57fe\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Reimage the host operating system or restore the compromised files to clean versions.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

However, they can also abuse legitimate utilities to drop these files.\n\nTeamViewer is a remote access and remote control tool used by helpdesks and system administrators to perform various support activities. It is also frequently used by attackers and scammers to deploy malware interactively and other malicious activities. This rule looks for the TeamViewer process creating files with suspicious extensions.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Contact the user to gather information about who and why was conducting the remote access.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check whether the company uses TeamViewer for the support activities and if there is a support ticket related to this access.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the file using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the company relies on TeamViewer to conduct remote access and the triage has not identified suspicious or malicious files.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Understanding what is commonly run within an environment and developing baselines for legitimate activity can help uncover potential malware and suspicious behaviors.\n\nThis rule uses a machine learning job to detect an anomalous Windows process with an unusual parent-child relationship, which could indicate malware execution or persistence activities on the host machine.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0.

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n  - If the parent process is a legitimate system utility or service, this could be related to software updates or system management. If the parent process is something user-facing like an Office application, this process could be more suspicious.\n  - Investigate the process metadata — such as the digital signature, directory, etc. — to obtain more context that can indicate whether the executable is associated with an expected software vendor or package.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Consider the user as identified by the `user.name` field. Is this program part of an expected workflow for the user who ran this program on this host?\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity, or legitimate software installations.\n- Validate if the activity has a consistent cadence (for example, if it runs monthly or quarterly), as it could be part of a monthly or quarterly business process.\n- Examine the arguments and working directory of the process. These may provide indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is performing.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Retrieve Service Unisgned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- If this activity is related to new benign software installation activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and command line conditions.\n- Try to understand the context of the execution by thinking about the user, machine, or business purpose.

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Suspicious Startup Shell Folder Modification\n\nTechniques used within malware and by adversaries often leverage the Windows registry to store malicious programs for persistence. Startup shell folders are often targeted as they are not as prevalent as normal Startup folder paths so this behavior may evade existing AV/EDR solutions. These programs may also run with higher privileges which can be ideal for an attacker.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Review the source process and related file tied to the Windows Registry entry.\n- Validate if the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity, or legitimate software installations.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the file using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- There is a high possibility of benign legitimate programs being added to shell folders. This activity could be based on new software installations, patches, or other network administrator activity. Before undertaking further investigation, it should be verified that this activity is not benign.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Startup or Run Key Registry Modification - 97fc44d3-8dae-4019-ae83-298c3015600f\n- Persistent Scripts in the Startup Directory - f7c4dc5a-a58d-491d-9f14-9b66507121c0\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:\n  - Block the email sender from sending future emails.\n  - Block the malicious web pages.\n  - Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes.\n  - Consider improvements to the security awareness program.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

The AppInit DLL mechanism is used to load custom code into user-mode processes, allowing for the customization of the user interface and the behavior of Windows-based applications.\n\nAttackers who add those DLLs to the registry locations can execute code with elevated privileges, similar to process injection, and provide a solid and constant persistence on the machine.\n\nThis rule identifies modifications on the AppInit registry keys.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Review the source process and related DLL file tied to the Windows Registry entry.\n  - Check whether the DLL is signed, and tied to a authorized program used on your environment.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n- Retrieve all DLLs under the AppInit registry keys:\n  - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve AppInit Registry Value\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM registry r where (r.key == 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Windows' or\\nr.key == 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Wow6432Node\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Windows') and r.name ==\\n'AppInit_DLLs'\\n\"}}\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable and the DLLs using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nAttackers can use .NET reflection to load PEs and DLLs in memory. These payloads are commonly embedded in the script, which can circumvent file-based security protections.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Examine file or network events from the involved PowerShell process for suspicious behavior.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the script using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately outside engineering or IT business units. As long as the analyst did not identify malware or suspicious activity related to the user or host, this alert can be dismissed.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- PowerShell PSReflect Script - 56f2e9b5-4803-4e44-a0a4-a52dc79d57fe\n- Potential Process Injection via PowerShell - 2e29e96a-b67c-455a-afe4-de6183431d0d\n- PowerShell Suspicious Payload Encoded and Compressed - 81fe9dc6-a2d7-4192-a2d8-eed98afc766a\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

One of these characteristics is file operations.\n\nThis rule looks for the creation of executable files done by system-critical processes. This can indicate the exploitation of a vulnerability or a malicious process masquerading as a system-critical process.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Container-bound scripts can contain malicious code that executes with the recipient's privileges if in their Drive.\n\nThis rule aims to detect when a user copies an external Drive object to their Drive storage and then grants permissions to a custom application via OAuth prompt.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n- Identify user account(s) associated by reviewing `user.name` or `source.user.email` in the alert.\n- Identify the name of the file copied by reviewing `file.name` as well as the `file.id` for triaging.\n- Identify the file type by reviewing `google_workspace.drive.file.type`.\n- With the information gathered so far, query across data for the file metadata to determine if this activity is isolated or widespread.\n- Within the OAuth token event, identify the application name by reviewing `google_workspace.token.app_name`.\n    - Review the application ID as well from `google_workspace.token.client.id`.\n    - This metadata can be used to report the malicious application to Google for permanent blacklisting.\n- Identify the permissions granted to the application by the user by reviewing `google_workspace.token.scope.data.scope_name`.\n    - This information will help pivot and triage into what services may have been affected.\n- If a container-bound script was attached to the copied object, it will also exist in the user's drive.\n    - This object should be removed from all users affected and investigated for a better understanding of the malicious code.\n\n### False positive analysis\n- Communicate with the affected user to identify if these actions were intentional\n- If a container-bound script exists, review code to identify if it is benign or malicious\n\n### Response and remediation\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n    - Resetting passwords will revoke OAuth tokens which could have been stolen.\n- Reactivate multi-factor authentication for the user.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security defaults [provided by Google](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-investigate-threats).\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\n## Setup\n\n### Important Information Regarding Google Workspace Event Lag Times\n- As per Google's documentation, Google Workspace administrators may observe lag times ranging from minutes up to 3 days between the time of an event's occurrence and the event being visible in the Google Workspace admin/audit logs.\n- This rule is configured to run every 10 minutes with a lookback time of 130 minutes.\n- To reduce the risk of false negatives, consider reducing the interval that the Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) Filebeat module polls Google's reporting API for new events.\n- By default, `var.interval` is set to 2 hours (2h). Consider changing this interval to a lower value, such as 10 minutes (10m).\n- See the following references for further information:\n  - https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566\n  - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html",

Programs added to this folder are executed during account logon, without user interaction, providing an excellent way for attackers to maintain persistence.\n\nThis rule looks for shortcuts created by wscript.exe or cscript.exe, or js/vbs scripts created by any process.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Validate if the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity, or legitimate software installations.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the file using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Suspicious Startup Shell Folder Modification - c8b150f0-0164-475b-a75e-74b47800a9ff\n- Startup Folder Persistence via Unsigned Process - 2fba96c0-ade5-4bce-b92f-a5df2509da3f\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Note that `Svchost.exe` is reserved for use by the operating system and should not be used by non-Windows services.\n\nThis rule looks for the creation of the `cmd.exe` process with `svchost.exe` as its parent process. This is an unusual behavior that can indicate the masquerading of a malicious process as `svchost.exe` or exploitation for privilege escalation.\n\n> **Note**:\n> This investigation guide uses the [Osquery Markdown Plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/invest-guide-run-osquery.html) introduced in Elastic Stack version 8.5.0. Older Elastic Stack versions will display unrendered Markdown in this guide.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Examine the host for derived artifacts that indicate suspicious activities:\n  - Analyze the process executable using a private sandboxed analysis system.\n  - Observe and collect information about the following activities in both the sandbox and the alert subject host:\n    - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - Use the Elastic Defend network events to determine domains and addresses contacted by the subject process by filtering by the process' `process.entity_id`.\n      - Examine the DNS cache for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n        - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve DNS Cache\",\"query\":\"SELECT * FROM dns_cache\"}}\n    - Use the Elastic Defend registry events to examine registry keys accessed, modified, or created by the related processes in the process tree.\n    - Examine the host services for suspicious or anomalous entries.\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve All Services\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Services Running on User Accounts\",\"query\":\"SELECT description, display_name, name, path, pid, service_type, start_type, status, user_account FROM services WHERE\\nNOT (user_account LIKE '%LocalSystem' OR user_account LIKE '%LocalService' OR user_account LIKE '%NetworkService' OR\\nuser_account == null)\\n\"}}\n      - !{osquery{\"label\":\"Osquery - Retrieve Service Unsigned Executables with Virustotal Link\",\"query\":\"SELECT concat('https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/', sha1) AS VtLink, name, description, start_type, status, pid,\\nservices.path FROM services JOIN authenticode ON services.path = authenticode.path OR services.module_path =\\nauthenticode.path JOIN hash ON services.path = hash.path WHERE authenticode.result != 'trusted'\\n\"}}\n  - Retrieve the files' SHA-256 hash values using the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet and search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Delete the service or restore it to the original configuration.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

For example, they can stop services associated with business applications and databases to release the lock on files used by these applications so they may be encrypted, or stop security and backup solutions, etc.\n\nThis rule identifies a high number (10) of service and/or process terminations (stop, delete, or suspend) from the same host within a short time period.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check if any files on the host machine have been encrypted.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further destructive behavior, which is commonly associated with this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Reimage the host operating system or restore it to the operational state.\n- If any other destructive action was identified on the host, it is recommended to prioritize the investigation and look for ransomware preparation and execution activities.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Attackers commonly inject these implementations into legitimate system processes.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate abnormal behaviors observed by the subject process, such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n- Retrieve the parent process executable and determine if it is malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Suspicious Process from Conhost - 28896382-7d4f-4d50-9b72-67091901fd26\n- Suspicious PowerShell Engine ImageLoad - 852c1f19-68e8-43a6-9dce-340771fe1be3\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Remote System Discovery Commands\n\nAfter successfully compromising an environment, attackers may try to gain situational awareness to plan their next steps. This can happen by running commands to enumerate network resources, users, connections, files, and installed security software.\n\nThis rule looks for the execution of the `arp` or `nbstat` utilities to enumerate remote systems in the environment, which is useful for attackers to identify lateral movement targets.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Discovery activities are not inherently malicious if they occur in isolation. As long as the analyst did not identify suspicious activity related to the user or host, such alerts can be dismissed.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Ransomware operators frequently use RDP to access victim servers, often using privileged accounts.\n\nThis rule detects the creation of a Windows Firewall inbound rule that would allow inbound RDP traffic using the `netsh.exe` utility.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the user to check if they are aware of the operation.\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check whether it makes sense to enable RDP to this host, given its role in the environment.\n- Check if the host is directly exposed to the internet.\n- Check whether privileged accounts accessed the host shortly after the modification.\n- Review network events within a short timespan of this alert for incoming RDP connection attempts.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- The `netsh.exe` utility can be used legitimately. Check whether the user should be performing this kind of activity, whether the user is aware of it, whether RDP should be open, and whether the action exposes the environment to unnecessary risks.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- If RDP is needed, make sure to secure it:\n  - Allowlist RDP traffic to specific trusted hosts.\n  - Restrict RDP logins to authorized non-administrator accounts, where possible.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating User account exposed to Kerberoasting\n\nService Principal Names (SPNs) are names by which Kerberos clients uniquely identify service instances for Kerberos target computers.\n\nBy default, only computer accounts have SPNs, which creates no significant risk, since machine accounts have a default domain policy that rotates their passwords every 30 days, and the password is composed of 120 random characters, making them invulnerable to Kerberoasting.\n\nA user account with an SPN assigned is considered a service account, and is accessible to the entire domain. If any user in the directory requests a ticket-granting service (TGS), the domain controller will encrypt it with the secret key of the account executing the service. An attacker can potentially perform a Kerberoasting attack with this information, as the human-defined password is likely to be less complex.\n\nFor scenarios where SPNs cannot be avoided on user accounts, Microsoft provides the Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) feature, which ensures that account passwords are robust and changed regularly and automatically. More information can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview).\n\nAttackers can also perform \"Targeted Kerberoasting\", which consists of adding fake SPNs to user accounts that they have write privileges to, making them potentially vulnerable to Kerberoasting.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate if the target account is a member of privileged groups (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, etc.).\n- Investigate if tickets have been requested for the target account.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- The use of user accounts as service accounts is a bad security practice and should not be allowed in the domain. The security team should map and monitor any potential benign true positive (B-TP), especially if the account is privileged. Domain Administrators that define this kind of setting can put the domain at risk as user accounts don't have the same security standards as computer accounts (which have long, complex, random passwords that change frequently), exposing them to credential cracking attacks (Kerberoasting, brute force, etc.).\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services. Prioritize privileged accounts.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Execution of File Written or Modified by Microsoft Office\n\nMicrosoft Office is a suite of applications designed to help with productivity and completing common tasks on a computer. You can create and edit documents containing text and images, work with data in spreadsheets and databases, and create presentations and posters. As it is some of the most-used software across companies, MS Office is frequently targeted for initial access. It also has a wide variety of capabilities that attackers can take advantage of.\n\nThis rule searches for executable files written by MS Office applications executed in sequence. This is most likely the result of the execution of malicious documents or exploitation for initial access or privilege escalation. This rule can also detect suspicious processes masquerading as the MS Office applications.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Retrieve MS Office documents received and opened by the user that could cause this behavior. Common locations include, but are not limited to, the Downloads and Document folders and the folder configured at the email client.\n- Determine if the collected files are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n  - If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:\n    - Block the email sender from sending future emails.\n    - Block the malicious web pages.\n    - Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes.\n    - Consider improvements to the security awareness program.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

The rc.local file has been deprecated in favor of the use of `systemd services`, and more recent Unix distributions no longer leverage this method of on-boot script execution. There might still be users that use rc.local in a benign matter, so investigation to see whether the file is malicious is vital. The first file to check can be found here:\n- /etc/rc.local\n\nThis file may contain a path to an executable, script or a command. Additionally, the `systemd-rc-local-generator` located at `/usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-rc-local-generator` is used to convert rc.local into rc-local.service. The service and wants files can be found in the following directories:\n- /lib/systemd/system/rc-local.service\n- /run/systemd/generator/multi-user.target.wants/rc-local.service\n\nIn case the file is not present here, the `sudo systemctl status rc-local` can be executed to find the location of the rc-local unit file. Make sure to investigate all files mentioned above, and files that these scripts may link to establish whether the alert is malicious or benign behavior.\n\n### Investigating RC script execution\nThe detection rule queries for the creation of these files, but manual analysis is required to check for rc script execution. Systemd will generate syslogs in case of the execution of the rc-local service. The following command can be used to check for the execution of this service:\n\n`sudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep \"rc-local.service|/etc/rc.local Compatibility\"`\n\nIf logging is found, analyze it, and chances are that the contents of the rc.local file have been executed. In case several syslog log files are available, use a wildcard to search through all of the available logs.\n\n### Response and remediation\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Delete the service/rc.local files or restore it to the original configuration.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Leverage the incident response data and logging to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

This detection rule was created based on activity represented in exploitation of vulnerability (CVE-2020-1350) also known as [SigRed](https://www.elastic.co/blog/detection-rules-for-sigred-vulnerability) during July 2020.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- This specific rule is sourced from network log activity such as DNS or network level data. It's important to validate the source of the incoming traffic and determine if this activity has been observed previously within an environment.\n- Activity can be further investigated and validated by reviewing any associated Intrusion Detection Signatures (IDS) alerts.\n- Further examination can include a review of the `dns.question_type` network fieldset with a protocol analyzer, such as Zeek, Packetbeat, or Suricata, for `SIG` or `RRSIG` data.\n- Validate the patch level and OS of the targeted DNS server to validate the observed activity was not large-scale internet vulnerability scanning.\n- Validate that the source of the network activity was not from an authorized vulnerability scan or compromise assessment.\n\n#### False positive analysis\n\n- Based on this rule, which looks for a threshold of 60k bytes, it is possible for activity to be generated under 65k bytes and related to legitimate behavior. In packet capture files received by the [SANS Internet Storm Center](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/PATCH+NOW+SIGRed+CVE20201350+Microsoft+DNS+Server+Vulnerability/26356/), byte responses were all observed as greater than 65k bytes.\n- This activity can be triggered by compliance/vulnerability scanning or compromise assessment; it's important to determine the source of the activity and potentially allowlist the source host.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Unusual Child Process of dns.exe - 8c37dc0e-e3ac-4c97-8aa0-cf6a9122de45\n- Unusual File Modification by dns.exe - c7ce36c0-32ff-4f9a-bfc2-dcb242bf99f9\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Ensure that you have deployed the latest Microsoft [Security Update](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1350) (Monthly Rollup or Security Only) and restarted the patched machines. If unable to patch immediately, Microsoft [released](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4569509/windows-dns-server-remote-code-execution-vulnerability) a registry-based workaround that doesn’t require a restart. This can be used as a temporary solution before the patch is applied.\n- Maintain backups of your critical systems to aid in quick recovery.\n- Perform routine vulnerability scans of your systems, monitor [CISA advisories](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity) and patch identified vulnerabilities.\n- If you observe a true positive, implement a remediation plan and monitor host-based artifacts for additional post-exploitation behavior.\n",

This is done by creating or modifying the `scripts.ini` or `psscripts.ini` files. The scripts are stored in the following paths:\n  - `<GPOPath>\\Machine\\Scripts\\`\n  - `<GPOPath>\\User\\Scripts\\`\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- This attack abuses a legitimate mechanism of Active Directory, so it is important to determine whether the activity is legitimate and the administrator is authorized to perform this operation.\n- Retrieve the contents of the `ScheduledTasks.xml` file, and check the `<Command>` and `<Arguments>` XML tags for any potentially malicious commands or binaries.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Scope which objects may be compromised by retrieving information about which objects are controlled by the GPO.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Verify if the execution is legitimately authorized and executed under a change management process.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Group Policy Abuse for Privilege Addition - b9554892-5e0e-424b-83a0-5aef95aa43bf\n- Scheduled Task Execution at Scale via GPO - 15a8ba77-1c13-4274-88fe-6bd14133861e\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- The investigation and containment must be performed in every computer controlled by the GPO, where necessary.\n- Remove the script from the GPO.\n- Check if other GPOs have suspicious scripts attached.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

By monitoring these events and understanding what is considered normal behavior within an organization, you can spot suspicious or malicious activity when deviations occur.\n\nThis rule uses a machine learning job to detect an unusual error in a CloudTrail message. This can be byproducts of attempted or successful persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, discovery, lateral movement, or collection.\n\nDetection alerts from this rule indicate a rare and unusual error code that was associated with the response to an AWS API command or method call.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the history of the error. If the error only manifested recently, it might be related to recent changes in an automation module or script. You can find the error in the `aws.cloudtrail.error_code field` field.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, or network administrator activity.\n- Examine the request parameters. These may indicate the source of the program or the nature of the task being performed when the error occurred.\n    - Check whether the error is related to unsuccessful attempts to enumerate or access objects, data, or secrets.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the calling user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Consider the time of day. If the user is a human (not a program or script), did the activity take place during a normal time of day?\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity if suspicious.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Examine the history of the command. If the command only manifested recently, it might be part of a new automation module or script. If it has a consistent cadence (for example, it appears in small numbers on a weekly or monthly cadence), it might be part of a housekeeping or maintenance process. You can find the command in the `event.action field` field.\n- The adoption of new services or the addition of new functionality to scripts may generate false positives.\n\n### Related Rules\n\n- Unusual City For an AWS Command - 809b70d3-e2c3-455e-af1b-2626a5a1a276\n- Unusual Country For an AWS Command - dca28dee-c999-400f-b640-50a081cc0fd1\n- Unusual AWS Command for a User - ac706eae-d5ec-4b14-b4fd-e8ba8086f0e1\n- Spike in AWS Error Messages - 78d3d8d9-b476-451d-a9e0-7a5addd70670\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Attackers can do this to cover their tracks and impact security monitoring that relies on this source.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Investigate the deleted log trail's criticality and whether the responsible team is aware of the deletion.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and IP address conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Possible Consent Grant Attack via Azure-Registered Application\n\nIn an illicit consent grant attack, the attacker creates an Azure-registered application that requests access to data such as contact information, email, or documents. The attacker then tricks an end user into granting that application consent to access their data either through a phishing attack, or by injecting illicit code into a trusted website. After the illicit application has been granted consent, it has account-level access to data without the need for an organizational account. Normal remediation steps like resetting passwords for breached accounts or requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) on accounts are not effective against this type of attack, since these are third-party applications and are external to the organization.\n\nOfficial Microsoft guidance for detecting and remediating this attack can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/detect-and-remediate-illicit-consent-grants).\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- From the Azure AD portal, Review the application that was granted permissions:\n  - Click on the `Review permissions` button on the `Permissions` blade of the application.\n  - An app should require only permissions related to the app's purpose. If that's not the case, the app might be risky.\n  - Apps that require high privileges or admin consent are more likely to be risky.\n- Investigate the app and the publisher. The following characteristics can indicate suspicious apps:\n  -  A low number of downloads.\n  -  Low rating or score or bad comments.\n  -  Apps with a suspicious publisher or website.\n  -  Apps whose last update is not recent. This might indicate an app that is no longer supported.\n- Export and examine the [Oauth app auditing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/manage-app-permissions#oauth-app-auditing) to identify users affected.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Malicious applications abuse the same workflow used by legitimate apps. Thus, analysts must review each app consent to ensure that only desired apps are granted access.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Disable the malicious application to stop user access and the application access to your data.\n- Revoke the application Oauth consent grant. The `Remove-AzureADOAuth2PermissionGrant` cmdlet can be used to complete this task.\n- Remove the service principal application role assignment. The `Remove-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment` cmdlet can be used to complete this task.\n- Revoke the refresh token for all users assigned to the application. Azure provides a [playbook](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/Revoke-AADSignInSessions) for this task.\n- [Report](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/manage-app-permissions#send-feedback) the application as malicious to Microsoft.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Investigate the potential for data compromise from the user's email and file sharing services. Activate your Data Loss incident response playbook.\n- Disable the permission for a user to set consent permission on their behalf.\n  - Enable the [Admin consent request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow) feature.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating Threat Intel Indicator Matches\n\nThreat Intel indicator match rules allow matching from a local observation such as an endpoint event that records a file hash with an entry of a file hash stored within the Threat Intel integrations. Matches can also occur on an IP address, registry path, URL, or imphash.\n\nThe matches will be based on the incoming last 30 days feed data so it's important to validate the data and review the results by investigating the associated activity to determine if it requires further investigation.\n\nIf an indicator matches a local observation, the following enriched fields will be generated to identify the indicator, field, and type matched.\n\n- `threat.indicator.matched.atomic` - this identifies the atomic indicator that matched the local observation\n- `threat.indicator.matched.field` - this identifies the indicator field that matched the local observation\n- `threat.indicator.matched.type` - this identifies the indicator type that matched the local observation\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Investigation should be validated and reviewed based on the data (file hash, registry path, URL, imphash) that was matched and by viewing the source of that activity.\n- Consider the history of the indicator that was matched. Has it happened before? Is it happening on multiple machines? These kinds of questions can help understand if the activity is related to legitimate behavior.\n- Consider the user and their role within the company: is this something related to their job or work function?\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n- For any matches found, it's important to consider the initial release date of that indicator. Threat intelligence can be a great tool for augmenting existing security processes, while at the same time it should be understood that threat intelligence can represent a specific set of activity observed at a point in time. For example, an IP address may have hosted malware observed in a Dridex campaign months ago, but it's possible that IP has been remediated and no longer represents any threat.\n- Adversaries often use legitimate tools as network administrators such as `PsExec` or `AdFind`; these tools often find their way into indicator lists creating the potential for false positives.\n- It's possible after large and publicly written campaigns, curious employees might end up going directly to attacker infrastructure and triggering these rules.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n- If suspicious or malicious behavior is observed, take immediate action to isolate activity to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- One example of a response if a machine matched a command and control IP address would be to add an entry to a network device such as a firewall or proxy appliance to prevent any outbound activity from leaving that machine.\n- Another example of a response with a malicious file hash match would involve validating if the file was properly quarantined, reviewing current running processes for any abnormal activity, and investigating for any other follow-up actions such as persistence or lateral movement.\n",

This can happen by running commands to enumerate network resources, users, connections, files, and installed security software.\n\nThis rule looks for connections to known IP lookup services through non-browser processes or non-installed programs. Using only the IP address of the compromised system, attackers can obtain valuable information such as the system's geographic location, the company that owns the IP, whether the system is cloud-hosted, and more.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate abnormal behaviors observed by the subject process, such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Discovery activities are not inherently malicious if they occur in isolation. As long as the analyst did not identify suspicious activity related to the user or host, such alerts can be dismissed.\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and command line conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Use the data collected through the analysis to investigate other machines affected in the environment.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Execution of File Written or Modified by PDF Reader\n\nPDF is a common file type used in corporate environments and most machines have software to handle these files. This creates a vector where attackers can exploit the engines and technology behind this class of software for initial access or privilege escalation.\n\nThis rule searches for executable files written by PDF reader software and executed in sequence. This is most likely the result of exploitation for privilege escalation or initial access. This rule can also detect suspicious processes masquerading as PDF readers.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Retrieve the PDF documents received and opened by the user that could cause this behavior. Common locations include, but are not limited to, the Downloads and Document folders and the folder configured at the email client.\n- Determine if the collected files are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n  - If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:\n    - Block the email sender from sending future emails.\n    - Block the malicious web pages.\n    - Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes.\n    - Consider improvements to the security awareness program.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Creation or Modification of Root Certificate\n\nRoot certificates are the primary level of certifications that tell a browser that the communication is trusted and legitimate. This verification is based upon the identification of a certification authority. Windows adds several trusted root certificates so browsers can use them to communicate with websites.\n\n[Check out this post](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/what-are-root-certificates-windows) for more details on root certificates and the involved cryptography.\n\nThis rule identifies the creation or modification of a root certificate by monitoring registry modifications. The installation of a malicious root certificate would allow an attacker the ability to masquerade malicious files as valid signed components from any entity (for example, Microsoft). It could also allow an attacker to decrypt SSL traffic.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate abnormal behaviors observed by the subject process such as network connections, other registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- If one of the processes is suspicious, retrieve it and determine if it is malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This detection may be triggered by certain applications that install root certificates for the purpose of inspecting SSL traffic. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove the malicious certificate from the root certificate store.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

A web shell is a web script that is placed on an openly accessible web server to allow an adversary to use the web server as a gateway into a network. A web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command line interface on the system that hosts the web server.\n\nThis rule detects a web server process spawning script and command line interface programs, potentially indicating attackers executing commands using the web shell.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate abnormal behaviors observed by the subject process such as network connections, file modifications, and\nany other spawned child processes.\n- Examine the command line to determine which commands or scripts were executed.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- If scripts or executables were dropped, retrieve the files and determine if they are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n        - Check if the domain is newly registered or unexpected.\n        - Check the reputation of the domain or IP address.\n      - File access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Cron jobs, services and other persistence mechanisms.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Any activity that triggered the alert and is not inherently malicious must be monitored by the security team.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

A list with descriptions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#risk-types-and-detection).\n- Identify the user account involved and validate whether the suspicious activity is normal for that user.\n  - Consider the source IP address and geolocation for the involved user account. Do they look normal?\n  - Consider the device used to sign in. Is it registered and compliant?\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\nIf this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and device conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Follow security best practices [outlined](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-best-practices) by Microsoft.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This can happen by running commands to enumerate network resources, users, connections, files, and installed security software.\n\nThis rule looks for the execution of account discovery utilities using the SYSTEM account, which is commonly observed after attackers successfully perform privilege escalation or exploit web applications.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n  - If the process tree includes a web-application server process such as w3wp, httpd.exe, nginx.exe and alike, investigate any suspicious file creation or modification in the last 48 hours to assess the presence of any potential webshell backdoor.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Determine how the SYSTEM account is being used. For example, users with administrator privileges can spawn a system shell using Windows services, scheduled tasks or other third party utilities.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Discovery activities are not inherently malicious if they occur in isolation. As long as the analyst did not identify suspicious activity related to the user or host, such alerts can be dismissed.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n- Use the data collected through the analysis to investigate other machines affected in the environment.",

A web shell is a web script that is placed on an openly accessible web server to allow an adversary to use the web server as a gateway into a network. A web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the web server.\n\nThis rule detects a web server process spawning script and command-line interface programs, potentially indicating attackers executing commands using the web shell.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate abnormal behaviors observed by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any other spawned child processes.\n- Examine the command line to determine which commands or scripts were executed.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n- If scripts or executables were dropped, retrieve the files and determine if they are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Any activity that triggered the alert and is not inherently malicious must be monitored by the security team.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Windows Defender Exclusions Added via PowerShell\n\nMicrosoft Windows Defender is an antivirus product built into Microsoft Windows. Since this software product is used to prevent and stop malware, it's important to monitor what specific exclusions are made to the product's configuration settings. These can often be signs of an adversary or malware trying to bypass Windows Defender's capabilities. One of the more notable [examples](https://www.cyberbit.com/blog/endpoint-security/latest-trickbot-variant-has-new-tricks-up-its-sleeve/) was observed in 2018 where Trickbot incorporated mechanisms to disable Windows Defender to avoid detection.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Examine the exclusion in order to determine the intent behind it.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n- If the exclusion specifies a suspicious file or path, retrieve the file(s) and determine if malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This rule has a high chance to produce false positives due to how often network administrators legitimately configure exclusions. In order to validate the activity further, review the specific exclusion and its intent. There are many legitimate reasons for exclusions, so it's important to gain context.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Windows Defender Disabled via Registry Modification - 2ffa1f1e-b6db-47fa-994b-1512743847eb\n- Disabling Windows Defender Security Settings via PowerShell - c8cccb06-faf2-4cd5-886e-2c9636cfcb87\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Exclusion lists for antimalware capabilities should always be routinely monitored for review.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nAttackers can use PowerShell to interact with the Windows API with the intent of capturing audio from input devices connected to the victim's computer.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Examine file or network events from the involved PowerShell process for suspicious behavior.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Investigate if the script stores the recorded data locally and determine if anything was recorded.\n- Investigate whether the script contains exfiltration capabilities and identify the exfiltration server.\n- Assess network data to determine if the host communicated with the exfiltration server.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Regular users should not need scripts to capture audio, which makes false positives unlikely. In the case of authorized benign true positives (B-TPs), exceptions can be added.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- PowerShell PSReflect Script - 56f2e9b5-4803-4e44-a0a4-a52dc79d57fe\n- Potential Process Injection via PowerShell - 2e29e96a-b67c-455a-afe4-de6183431d0d\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Prioritize the response if this alert involves key executives or potentially valuable targets for espionage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Disabling it is a common step in threat actor playbooks.\n\nThis rule monitors the registry for configurations that disable Windows Defender or the start of its service.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity, or legitimate software installations.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the administrator is aware of the activity, the configuration is justified (for example, it is being used to deploy other security solutions or troubleshooting), and no other suspicious activity has been observed.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Disabling Windows Defender Security Settings via PowerShell - c8cccb06-faf2-4cd5-886e-2c9636cfcb87\n- Microsoft Windows Defender Tampering - fe794edd-487f-4a90-b285-3ee54f2af2d3\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Re-enable Windows Defender and restore the service configurations to automatic start.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Suspicious MS Outlook Child Process\n\nMicrosoft Outlook is an email client that provides contact, email calendar, and task management features. Outlook is widely used, either standalone or as part of the Office suite.\n\nThis rule looks for suspicious processes spawned by MS Outlook, which can be the result of the execution of malicious documents and/or exploitation for initial access.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Retrieve recently opened files received via email and opened by the user that could cause this behavior. Common locations include but are not limited to, the Downloads and Document folders and the folder configured at the email client.\n- Determine if the collected files are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n  - If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:\n    - Block the email sender from sending future emails.\n    - Block the malicious web pages.\n    - Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes.\n    - Consider improvements to the security awareness program.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

With IAM, you can specify who can access which services and resources, and under which conditions. With IAM policies, you manage permissions to your workforce and systems to ensure least-privilege permissions.\n\nThis rule looks for the addition of users to a specified user group.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- False positives may occur due to the intended usage of the service. Tuning is needed in order to have higher confidence. Consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user agent and IP address conditions — to reduce noise from onboarding processes and administrator activities.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account and system owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n- Identify the target host IP address, check the connections originating from the host where the modification occurred, and inspect the credentials used.\n  - Investigate suspicious login activity, such as unauthorized access and logins from outside working hours and unusual locations.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the Administrator is aware of the activity and there are justifications for this configuration.\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and command line conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Delete the port forwarding rule.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences involving other users.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and IP address conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating External User Added to Google Workspace Group\n\nGoogle Workspace groups allow organizations to assign specific users to a group that can share resources. Application specific roles can be manually set for each group, but if not inherit permissions from the top-level organizational unit.\n\nThreat actors may use phishing techniques and container-bound scripts to add external Google accounts to an organization's groups with editorial privileges. As a result, the user account is unable to manually access the organization's resources, settings and files, but will receive anything shared to the group. As a result, confidential information could be leaked or perhaps documents shared with editorial privileges be weaponized for further intrusion.\n\nThis rule identifies when an external user account is added to an organization's groups where the domain name of the target does not match the Google Workspace domain.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n- Identify user account(s) associated by reviewing `user.name` or `user.email` in the alert\n  - The `user.target.email` field contains the user added to the groups\n  - The `group.name` field contains the group the target user was added to\n- Identify specific application settings given to the group which may indicate motive for the external user joining a particular group\n- With the user identified, verify administrative privileges are scoped properly to add external users to the group\n  - Unauthorized actions may indicate the `user.email` account has been compromised or leveraged to add an external user\n- To identify other users in this group, search for `event.action: \"ADD_GROUP_MEMBER\"`\n  - It is important to understand if external users with `@gmail.com` are expected to be added to this group based on historical references\n- Review Gmail logs where emails were sent to and from the `group.name` value\n  - This may indicate potential internal spearphishing\n\n### False positive analysis\n- With the user account whom added the new user, verify this action was intentional\n- Verify that the target whom was added to the group is expected to have access to the organization's resources and data\n- If other members have been added to groups that are external, this may indicate historically that this action is expected\n\n### Response and remediation\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Reactivate multi-factor authentication for the user.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security defaults [provided by Google](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-investigate-threats).\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\n\n\n### Important Information Regarding Google Workspace Event Lag Times\n- As per Google's documentation, Google Workspace administrators may observe lag times ranging from minutes up to 3 days between the time of an event's occurrence and the event being visible in the Google Workspace admin/audit logs.\n- This rule is configured to run every 10 minutes with a lookback time of 130 minutes.\n- To reduce the risk of false negatives, consider reducing the interval that the Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) Filebeat module polls Google's reporting API for new events.\n- By default, `var.interval` is set to 2 hours (2h). Consider changing this interval to a lower value, such as 10 minutes (10m).\n- See the following references for further information:\n  - https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566\n  - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html",

This process is commonly known as DNS tunneling.\n\nMore information on how tunneling works and how it can be abused can be found on [Palo Alto Unit42 Research](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/dns-tunneling-how-dns-can-be-abused-by-malicious-actors).\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the DNS query and identify the information sent.\n- Extract this communication's indicators of compromise (IoCs) and use traffic logs to search for other potentially compromised hosts.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. If the parent process is trusted and the data sent is not sensitive nor command and control related, this alert can be closed.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n- Implement any temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation required to contain the attack.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Update firewall rules to be more restrictive.\n- Reimage the host operating system or restore the compromised files to clean versions.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS CloudTrail Log Updated\n\nAmazon CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your Amazon Web Services account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your Amazon Web Services infrastructure. CloudTrail provides event history of your Amazon Web Services account activity, including actions taken through the Amazon Management Console, Amazon SDKs, command line tools, and other Amazon Web Services services. This event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.\n\nThis rule identifies a modification on CloudTrail settings using the API `UpdateTrail` action. Attackers can do this to cover their tracks and impact security monitoring that relies on this source.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Examine the response elements of the event to determine the scope of the changes.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and IP address conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This rule looks for a spawned process by Microsoft Office, scripting, and command line applications, followed by a process access event for an unknown memory region by the parent process, which can indicate a code injection attempt.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n- Create a memory dump of the child process for analysis.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Compressing the data can help obfuscate the collected data and minimize the amount of data sent over the network. Encryption can be used to hide information that is being exfiltrated from detection or make exfiltration less apparent upon inspection by a defender.\n\nThese steps are usually done in preparation for exfiltration, meaning the attack may be in its final stages.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Retrieve the encrypted file.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check if the password used in the encryption was included in the command line.\n- Decrypt the `.rar`/`.zip` and check if the information is sensitive.\n- If the password is not available, and the format is `.zip` or the option used in WinRAR is not the `-hp`, list the file names included in the encrypted file.\n- Investigate if the file was transferred to an attacker-controlled server.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Backup software can use these utilities. Check the `process.parent.executable` and `process.parent.command_line` fields to determine what triggered the encryption.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Prioritize cases that involve personally identifiable information (PII) or other classified data.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Understanding what is commonly run within an environment and developing baselines for legitimate activity can help uncover potential malware and suspicious behaviors.\n\nThis rule uses a machine learning job to detect a Linux process that is rare and unusual for an individual Linux host in your environment.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, and whether they are located in expected locations.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Consider the user as identified by the `user.name` field. Is this program part of an expected workflow for the user who ran this program on this host?\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity, or legitimate software installations.\n- Validate if the activity has a consistent cadence (for example, if it runs monthly or quarterly), as it could be part of a monthly or quarterly business process.\n- Examine the arguments and working directory of the process. These may provide indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is performing.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- If this activity is related to new benign software installation activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and command line conditions.\n- Try to understand the context of the execution by thinking about the user, machine, or business purpose. A small number of endpoints, such as servers with unique software, might appear unusual but satisfy a specific business need.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Since it is impossible to make a backup of something you cannot read, this privilege comes at the cost of providing the user with full read access to the file system. This privilege must bypass any access control list (ACL) placed in the system.\n\nThis rule identifies remote access to the registry using an account with Backup Operators group membership. This may indicate an attempt to exfiltrate credentials by dumping the Security Account Manager (SAM) registry hive in preparation for credential access and privileges elevation.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate the activities done by the subject user the login session. The field `winlog.event_data.SubjectLogonId` can be used to get this data.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate abnormal behaviors observed by the subject user such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and processes created.\n- Investigate if the registry file was retrieved or exfiltrated.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this activity is expected and noisy in your environment, benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Limit or disable the involved user account to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Check whether the user is an administrator and is legitimately performing troubleshooting.\n- In case of an allowed benign true positive (B-TP), assess adding rules to allow needed traffic and re-enable the firewall.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating PowerShell Share Enumeration Script\n\nPowerShell is one of the main tools system administrators use for automation, report routines, and other tasks. This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nAttackers can use PowerShell to enumerate shares to search for sensitive data like documents, scripts, and other kinds of valuable data for encryption, exfiltration, and lateral movement.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Check for additional PowerShell and command line logs that indicate that imported functions were run.\n  - Evaluate which information was potentially mapped and accessed by the attacker.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Execution via MSSQL xp_cmdshell Stored Procedure\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server (MSSQL) has procedures meant to extend its functionality, the Extended Stored Procedures. These procedures are external functions written in C/C++; some provide interfaces for external programs. This is the case for xp_cmdshell, which spawns a Windows command shell and passes in a string for execution. Attackers can use this to execute commands on the system running the SQL server, commonly to escalate their privileges and establish persistence.\n\nThe xp_cmdshell procedure is disabled by default, but when used, it has the same security context as the MSSQL Server service account, which is often privileged.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Examine the command line to determine if the command executed is potentially harmful or malicious.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately, but it brings inherent risk. The security team must monitor any activity of it. If recurrent tasks are being executed using this mechanism, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a full command line.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Ensure that SQL servers are not directly exposed to the internet. If there is a business justification for such, use an allowlist to allow only connections from known legitimate sources.\n- Disable the xp_cmdshell stored procedure.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

The functionality provided by RunDLL32 to execute Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) is widely abused by attackers, because it makes it hard to differentiate malicious activity from normal operations.\n\nThis rule looks for external network connections established using RunDLL32 when the utility is being executed with no arguments, which can potentially indicate command and control activity.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate the target host that RunDLL32 is communicating with.\n  - Check if the domain is newly registered or unexpected.\n  - Check the reputation of the domain or IP address.\n- Identify the target computer and its role in the IT environment.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Are they expected or unexpected?\n- If the destination IP address is remote or external, does it associate with an expected domain, organization or geography? Note: avoid interacting directly with suspected malicious IP addresses.\n- Consider the user as identified by the username field. Is this network activity part of an expected workflow for the user who ran the program?\n- Examine the history of execution. If this process only manifested recently, it might be part of a new software package. If it has a consistent cadence (for example if it runs monthly or quarterly), it might be part of a monthly or quarterly business or maintenance process.\n- Examine the process arguments, title and working directory. These may provide indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is performing.",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Suspicious PDF Reader Child Process\n\nPDF is a common file type used in corporate environments and most machines have software to handle these files. This creates a vector where attackers can exploit the engines and technology behind this class of software for initial access or privilege escalation.\n\nThis rule looks for commonly abused built-in utilities spawned by a PDF reader process, which is likely a malicious behavior.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Retrieve PDF documents received and opened by the user that could cause this behavior. Common locations include, but are not limited to, the Downloads and Document folders and the folder configured at the email client.\n- Determine if the collected files are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n  - If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:\n    - Block the email sender from sending future emails.\n    - Block the malicious web pages.\n    - Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes.\n    - Consider improvements to the security awareness program.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Exchange Mailbox Export via PowerShell\n\nThe `New-MailBoxExportRequest` cmdlet is used to begin the process of exporting contents of a primary mailbox or archive to a .pst file. Note that this is done on a per-mailbox basis and this cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.\nAttackers can abuse this functionality in preparation for exfiltrating contents, which is likely to contain sensitive and strategic data.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate the export operation:\n  - Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n  - Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n  - Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n  - Retrieve the operation status and use the `Get-MailboxExportRequest` cmdlet to review previous requests.\n  - By default, no group in Exchange has the privilege to import or export mailboxes. Investigate administrators that assigned the \"Mailbox Import Export\" privilege for abnormal activity.\n- Investigate if there is a significant quantity of export requests in the alert timeframe. This operation is done on a per-mailbox basis and can be part of a mass export.\n- If the operation was completed successfully:\n  - Check if the file is on the path specified in the command.\n  - Investigate if the file was compressed, archived, or retrieved by the attacker for exfiltration.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the administrator is aware of the activity and it is done with proper approval.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- If the involved host is not the Exchange server, isolate the host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Use the `Remove-MailboxExportRequest` cmdlet to remove fully or partially completed export requests.\n- Prioritize cases that involve personally identifiable information (PII) or other classified data.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Review the privileges of users with the \"Mailbox Import Export\" privilege to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating PsExec Network Connection\n\nPsExec is a remote administration tool that enables the execution of commands with both regular and SYSTEM privileges on Windows systems. Microsoft develops it as part of the Sysinternals Suite. Although commonly used by administrators, PsExec is frequently used by attackers to enable lateral movement and execute commands as SYSTEM to disable defenses and bypass security protections.\n\nThis rule identifies PsExec execution by looking for the creation of `PsExec.exe`, the default name for the utility, followed by a network connection done by the process.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Check if the usage of this tool complies with the organization's administration policy.\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Identify the target computer and its role in the IT environment.\n- Investigate what commands were run, and assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. As long as the analyst did not identify suspicious activity related to the user or involved hosts, and the tool is allowed by the organization's policy, such alerts can be dismissed.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n  - Prioritize cases involving critical servers and users.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nAttackers can abuse Process Memory Dump capabilities to extract credentials from LSASS or to obtain other privileged information stored in the process memory.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Examine file or network events from the involved PowerShell process for suspicious behavior.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Check if the imported function was executed and which process it targeted.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Regular users do not have a business justification for using scripting utilities to dump process memory, making false positives unlikely.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- PowerShell PSReflect Script - 56f2e9b5-4803-4e44-a0a4-a52dc79d57fe\n- Potential Process Injection via PowerShell - 2e29e96a-b67c-455a-afe4-de6183431d0d\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating RDP Enabled via Registry\n\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary Microsoft protocol that enables remote connections to other computers, typically over TCP port 3389.\n\nAttackers can use RDP to conduct their actions interactively. Ransomware operators frequently use RDP to access victim servers, often using privileged accounts.\n\nThis rule detects modification of the fDenyTSConnections registry key to the value `0`, which specifies that remote desktop connections are enabled. Attackers can abuse remote registry, use psexec, etc., to enable RDP and move laterally.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the user to check if they are aware of the operation.\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check whether it makes sense to enable RDP to this host, given its role in the environment.\n- Check if the host is directly exposed to the internet.\n- Check whether privileged accounts accessed the host shortly after the modification.\n- Review network events within a short timespan of this alert for incoming RDP connection attempts.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Check whether the user should be performing this kind of activity, whether they are aware of it, whether RDP should be open, and whether the action exposes the environment to unnecessary risks.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- If RDP is needed, make sure to secure it using firewall rules:\n  - Allowlist RDP traffic to specific trusted hosts.\n  - Restrict RDP logins to authorized non-administrator accounts, where possible.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Adversaries can tamper, clear, and delete this data to break SIEM detections, cover their tracks, and slow down incident response.\n\nThis rule looks for the occurrence of clear actions on the `security` event log.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n  - Verify if any other anti-forensics behaviors were observed.\n- Investigate the event logs prior to the action for suspicious behaviors that an attacker may be trying to cover up.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n  - This activity is potentially done after the adversary achieves its objectives on the host. Ensure that previous actions, if any, are investigated accordingly with their response playbooks.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Adversaries can leverage an open-source tool PRoot to expand the scope of their operations to multiple Linux distributions and simplify their necessary efforts. In a normal threat scenario, the scope of an attack is limited by the varying configurations of each Linux distribution. With PRoot, it provides an attacker with a consistent operational environment across different Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Alpine. PRoot also provides emulation capabilities that allow for malware built on other architectures, such as ARM, to be run.The post-exploitation technique called bring your own filesystem (BYOF), can be used by the threat actors to execute malicious payload or elevate privileges or perform network scans or orchestrate another attack on the environment. Although PRoot was originally not developed with malicious intent it can be easily tuned to work for one.",

This allows them to keep operating after the security team discovers abused accounts.\n\nThis rule monitors events related to a user being added to a privileged group.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should manage members of this group.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This attack abuses a legitimate Active Directory mechanism, so it is important to determine whether the activity is legitimate, if the administrator is authorized to perform this operation, and if there is a need to grant the account this level of privilege.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- If the admin is not aware of the operation, activate your Active Directory incident response plan.\n- If the user does not need the administrator privileges, remove the account from the privileged group.\n- Review the privileges of the administrator account that performed the action.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Azure Service Principal Addition\n\nService Principals are identities used by applications, services, and automation tools to access specific resources. They grant specific access based on the assigned API permissions. Most organizations that work a lot with Azure AD make use of service principals. Whenever an application is registered, it automatically creates an application object and a service principal in an Azure AD tenant.\n\nThis rule looks for the addition of service principals. This behavior may enable attackers to impersonate legitimate service principals to camouflage their activities among noisy automations/apps.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Consider the source IP address and geolocation for the user who issued the command. Do they look normal for the user?\n- Consider the time of day. If the user is a human, not a program or script, did the activity take place during a normal time of day?\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Examine the account's commands, API calls, and data management actions in the last 24 hours.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\nIf this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and device conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Follow security best practices [outlined](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-best-practices) by Microsoft.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate the target host that the process is communicating with.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

If the permissions on any of the protected accounts and groups do not match, it resets the permissions on the protected accounts and groups to match those defined in the domain AdminSDHolder object.\n\nThe dSHeuristics is a Unicode string attribute, in which each character in the string represents a heuristic that is used to determine the behavior of Active Directory.\n\nAdministrators can use the dSHeuristics attribute to exclude privilege groups from the SDProp process by setting the 16th bit (dwAdminSDExMask) of the string to a certain value, which represents the group(s):\n\n- For example, to exclude the Account Operators group, an administrator would modify the string, so the 16th character is set to 1 (i.e., 0000000001000001).\n\nThe usage of this exclusion can leave the accounts unprotected and facilitate the misconfiguration of privileges for the excluded groups, enabling attackers to add accounts to these groups to maintain long-term persistence with high privileges.\n\nThis rule matches changes of the dsHeuristics object where the 16th bit is set to a value other than zero.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account and system owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check the value assigned to the 16th bit of the string on the `winlog.event_data.AttributeValue` field:\n    - Account Operators eq 1\n    - Server Operators eq 2\n    - Print Operators eq 4\n    - Backup Operators eq 8\n    The field value can range from 0 to f (15). If more than one group is specified, the values will be summed together; for example, Backup Operators and Print Operators will set the `c` value on the bit.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- While this modification can be done legitimately, it is not a best practice. Any potential benign true positive (B-TP) should be mapped and reviewed by the security team for alternatives as this weakens the security of the privileged group.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- The change can be reverted by setting the dwAdminSDExMask (16th bit) to 0 in dSHeuristics.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Enabling this setting is bad practice and can expose environments to vulnerabilities that weaken security posture, especially when these accounts are privileged.\n\nThe setting is usually configured so a user account can act as a service account. Attackers can abuse these accounts to persist in the domain and maintain long-term access using compromised accounts with a never-expiring password set.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/source host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the account for suspicious or abnormal behaviors in the alert timeframe.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity should not happen legitimately. The security team should address any potential benign true positive (B-TP), as this configuration can put the user and the domain at risk.\n- Using user accounts as service accounts is a bad security practice and should not be allowed in the domain. The security team should map and monitor potential benign true positives (B-TPs), especially if the account is privileged. For cases in which user accounts cannot be avoided, Microsoft provides the Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) feature, which ensures that the account password is robust and changed regularly and automatically.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Reset the password of the account and update its password settings.\n- Search for other occurrences on the domain.\n    - Using the [Active Directory PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-aduser):\n        - `get-aduser -filter { passwordNeverExpires -eq $true  -and enabled -eq $true } | ft`\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Understanding what is commonly run within an environment and developing baselines for legitimate activity can help uncover potential malware and suspicious behaviors.\n\nThis rule uses a machine learning job to detect a Linux process that is rare and unusual for all of the monitored Linux hosts in your fleet.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, and whether they are located in expected locations.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Consider the user as identified by the `user.name` field. Is this program part of an expected workflow for the user who ran this program on this host?\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity, or legitimate software installations.\n- Validate if the activity has a consistent cadence (for example, if it runs monthly or quarterly), as it could be part of a monthly or quarterly business process.\n- Examine the arguments and working directory of the process. These may provide indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is performing.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- If this activity is related to new benign software installation activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and command line conditions.\n- Try to understand the context of the execution by thinking about the user, machine, or business purpose. A small number of endpoints, such as servers with unique software, might appear unusual but satisfy a specific business need.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that   attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

This creates an open port on every worker node in the cluster that has a pod for that service. When external traffic is received on that open port, it directs it to the specific pod through the service representing it. A malicious user can configure a service as type Nodeport in order to intercept traffic from other pods or nodes, bypassing firewalls and other network security measures configured for load balancers within a cluster. This creates a direct method of communication between the cluster and the outside world, which could be used for more malicious behavior and certainly widens the attack surface of your cluster.",

You'll be able to contact the NodePort Service from outside the cluster, by requesting <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.

For example, they can kill process associated with business applications and databases to release the lock on files used by these applications so they may be encrypted,or stop security and backup solutions, etc.\n\nThis rule identifies a high number (10) of process terminations via pkill from the same host within a short time period.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the entry point to the host and user in action via the Analyse View.\n  - Identify the session entry leader and session user.\n- Examine the contents of session leading to the process termination(s) via the Session View.\n  - Examine the command execution pattern in the session, which may lead to suspricous activities.\n- Examine the process killed during the malicious execution\n  - Identify imment threat to the system from the process killed.\n  - Take necessary incident response actions to respawn necessary process.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further destructive behavior, which is commonly associated with this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Reimage the host operating system or restore it to the operational state.\n- If any other destructive action was identified on the host, it is recommended to prioritize the investigation and look for ransomware preparation and execution activities.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

These tools can include discovery utilities, credential dumpers, malware, etc. Attackers can also leverage file shares that employees frequently access to host malicious files to gain a foothold in other machines.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Retrieve the created file and determine if it is malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity can happen legitimately. Consider adding exceptions if it is expected and noisy in your environment.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Review the privileges needed to write to the network share and restrict write access as needed.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS CloudWatch Log Group Deletion\n\nAmazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events for resources and applications. This data can be used to detect anomalous behavior in your environments, set alarms, visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep your applications running smoothly.\n\nA log group is a group of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. You can define log groups and specify which streams to put into each group. There is no limit on the number of log streams that can belong to one log group.\n\nThis rule looks for the deletion of a log group using the API `DeleteLogGroup` action. Attackers can do this to cover their tracks and impact security monitoring that relies on these sources.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Investigate the deleted log group's criticality and whether the responsible team is aware of the deletion.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and IP address conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating Threat Intel Indicator Matches\n\nThreat Intel indicator match rules allow matching from a local observation such as an endpoint event that records a file hash with an entry of a file hash stored within the Threat Intel integrations. Matches can also occur on an IP address, registry path, URL, or imphash.\n\nThe matches will be based on the incoming last 30 days feed data so it's important to validate the data and review the results by investigating the associated activity to determine if it requires further investigation.\n\nIf an indicator matches a local observation, the following enriched fields will be generated to identify the indicator, field, and type matched.\n\n- `threat.indicator.matched.atomic` - this identifies the atomic indicator that matched the local observation\n- `threat.indicator.matched.field` - this identifies the indicator field that matched the local observation\n- `threat.indicator.matched.type` - this identifies the indicator type that matched the local observation\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Investigation should be validated and reviewed based on the data (file hash, registry path, URL, imphash) that was matched and by viewing the source of that activity.\n- Consider the history of the indicator that was matched. Has it happened before? Is it happening on multiple machines? These kinds of questions can help understand if the activity is related to legitimate behavior.\n- Consider the user and their role within the company: is this something related to their job or work function?\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n- For any matches found, it's important to consider the initial release date of that indicator. Threat intelligence can be a great tool for augmenting existing security processes, while at the same time it should be understood that threat intelligence can represent a specific set of activity observed at a point in time. For example, an IP address may have hosted malware observed in a Dridex campaign months ago, but it's possible that IP has been remediated and no longer represents any threat.\n- Adversaries often use legitimate tools as network administrators such as `PsExec` or `AdFind`; these tools often find their way into indicator lists creating the potential for false positives.\n- It's possible after large and publicly written campaigns, curious employees might end up going directly to attacker infrastructure and triggering these rules.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n- If suspicious or malicious behavior is observed, take immediate action to isolate activity to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- One example of a response if a machine matched a command and control IP address would be to add an entry to a network device such as a firewall or proxy appliance to prevent any outbound activity from leaving that machine.\n- Another example of a response with a malicious file hash match would involve validating if the file was properly quarantined, reviewing current running processes for any abnormal activity, and investigating for any other follow-up actions such as persistence or lateral movement.\n",

These are stored in a boot configuration data (BCD) store, and administrators can use utilities like `bcdedit.exe` to configure these.\n\nThis rule identifies the usage of `bcdedit.exe` to:\n\n- Disable Windows Error Recovery (recoveryenabled).\n- Ignore errors if there is a failed boot, failed shutdown, or failed checkpoint (bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures).\n\nThese are common steps in destructive attacks by adversaries leveraging ransomware.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n- Check if any files on the host machine have been encrypted.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- The usage of these options is not inherently malicious. Administrators can modify these configurations to force a machine to boot for troubleshooting or data recovery purposes.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Deleting Backup Catalogs with Wbadmin - 581add16-df76-42bb-af8e-c979bfb39a59\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Consider isolating the involved host to prevent destructive behavior, which is commonly associated with this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- If any other destructive action was identified on the host, it is recommended to prioritize the investigation and look for ransomware preparation and execution activities.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Exporting Exchange Mailbox via PowerShell\n\nEmail mailboxes and their information can be valuable assets for attackers. Company mailboxes often contain sensitive information such as login credentials, intellectual property, financial data, and personal information, making them high-value targets for malicious actors.\n\nThe `New-MailBoxExportRequest` cmdlet is used to begin the process of exporting contents of a primary mailbox or archive to a .pst file. Note that this is done on a per-mailbox basis and this cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.\n\nAttackers can abuse this functionality in preparation for exfiltrating contents, which is likely to contain sensitive and strategic data.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate the export operation:\n  - Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n  - Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n  - Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n  - Retrieve the operation status and use the `Get-MailboxExportRequest` cmdlet to review previous requests.\n  - By default, no group in Exchange has the privilege to import or export mailboxes. Investigate administrators that assigned the \"Mailbox Import Export\" privilege for abnormal activity.\n- Investigate if there is a significant quantity of export requests in the alert timeframe. This operation is done on a per-mailbox basis and can be part of a mass export.\n- If the operation was completed successfully:\n  - Check if the file is on the path specified in the command.\n  - Investigate if the file was compressed, archived, or retrieved by the attacker for exfiltration.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the administrator is aware of the activity and it is done with proper approval.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- If the involved host is not the Exchange server, isolate the host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Use the `Remove-MailboxExportRequest` cmdlet to remove fully or partially completed export requests.\n- Prioritize cases that involve personally identifiable information (PII) or other classified data.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Review the privileges of users with the \"Mailbox Import Export\" privilege to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This can happen by running commands to enumerate network resources, users, connections, files, and installed security software.\n\nThis rule looks for the execution of the `wmic` utility with arguments compatible to the enumeration of the security software installed on the host. Attackers can use this information to decide whether or not to infect a system, disable protections, use bypasses, etc.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Discovery activities are not inherently malicious if they occur in isolation. As long as the analyst did not identify suspicious activity related to the user or host, such alerts can be dismissed.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your Amazon Web Services infrastructure. CloudTrail provides event history of your Amazon Web Services account activity, including actions taken through the Amazon Management Console, Amazon SDKs, command line tools, and other Amazon Web Services services. This event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.\n\nThis rule identifies the deletion of an AWS log trail using the API `DeleteTrail` action. Attackers can do this to cover their tracks and impact security monitoring that relies on this source.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Investigate the deleted log trail's criticality and whether the responsible team is aware of the deletion.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and IP address conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS Config Resource Deletion\n\nAWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.\n\nThis rule looks for the deletion of AWS Config resources using various API actions. Attackers can do this to cover their tracks and impact security monitoring that relies on these sources.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Identify the AWS resource that was involved and its criticality, ownership, and role in the environment. Also investigate if the resource is security-related.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the calling user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and IP address conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Each capability grants a thread just enough power to perform specific privileged tasks. In Kubernetes, containers are given a set of default capabilities that can be dropped or added to at the time of creation. Added capabilities entitle containers in a pod with additional privileges that can be used to change\ncore processes, change network settings of a cluster, or directly access the underlying host. The following have been used in container escape techniques:\n\nBPF - Allow creating BPF maps, loading BPF Type Format (BTF) data, retrieve JITed code of BPF programs, and more.\nDAC_READ_SEARCH - Bypass file read permission checks and directory read and execute permission checks.\nNET_ADMIN - Perform various network-related operations.\nSYS_ADMIN - Perform a range of system administration operations.\nSYS_BOOT - Use reboot(2) and kexec_load(2), reboot and load a new kernel for later execution.\nSYS_MODULE - Load and unload kernel modules.\nSYS_PTRACE - Trace arbitrary processes using ptrace(2).\nSYS_RAWIO - Perform I/O port operations (iopl(2) and ioperm(2)).\nSYSLOG - Perform privileged syslog(2) operations.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- While these capabilities are not included by default in containers, some legitimate images may need to add them. This rule leaves space for the exception of trusted container images. To add an exception, add the trusted container image name to the query field, kubernetes.audit.requestObject.spec.containers.image.",

This can be due to credentialed access via a compromised account when the user and the threat actor are in different time zones. It can also indicate unauthorized user activity, as it often occurs during non-business hours.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, network connections, data access, and logon events.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the involved users during the past 48 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Users may need to log in during non-business hours to perform work-related tasks. Examine whether the company policies authorize this or if the activity is done under change management.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Potential Remote Desktop Tunneling Detected\n\nProtocol Tunneling is a mechanism that involves explicitly encapsulating a protocol within another for various use cases, ranging from providing an outer layer of encryption (similar to a VPN) to enabling traffic that network appliances would filter to reach their destination.\n\nAttackers may tunnel Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) traffic through other protocols like Secure Shell (SSH) to bypass network restrictions that block incoming RDP connections but may be more permissive to other protocols.\n\nThis rule looks for command lines involving the `3389` port, which RDP uses by default and options commonly associated with tools that perform tunneling.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account and system owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n- Examine network data to determine if the host communicated with external servers using the tunnel.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n- Investigate the command line for the execution of programs that are unrelated to tunneling, like Remote Desktop clients.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Take the necessary actions to disable the tunneling, which can be a process kill, service deletion, registry key modification, etc. Inspect the host to learn which method was used and to determine a response for the case.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Consider changing this interval to a lower value, such as 10 minutes (10m).\n- See the following references for further information:\n  - https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566\n  - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html",

PIM can be used to manage the built-in Azure resource roles such as Global Administrator and Application Administrator.\n\nThis rule identifies the update of PIM role settings, which can indicate that an attacker has already gained enough access to modify role assignment settings.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Consider the source IP address and geolocation for the user who issued the command. Do they look normal for the user?\n- Consider the time of day. If the user is a human, not a program or script, did the activity take place during a normal time of day?\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Examine the account's commands, API calls, and data management actions in the last 24 hours.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this activity didn't follow your organization's change management policies, it should be reviewed by the security team.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Restore the PIM roles to the desired state.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Follow security best practices [outlined](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-best-practices) by Microsoft.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Spike in AWS Error Messages\n\nCloudTrail logging provides visibility on actions taken within an AWS environment. By monitoring these events and understanding what is considered normal behavior within an organization, you can spot suspicious or malicious activity when deviations occur.\n\nThis rule uses a machine learning job to detect a significant spike in the rate of a particular error in the CloudTrail messages. Spikes in error messages may accompany attempts at privilege escalation, lateral movement, or discovery.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the history of the error. If the error only manifested recently, it might be related to recent changes in an automation module or script. You can find the error in the `aws.cloudtrail.error_code field` field.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, or network administrator activity.\n- Examine the request parameters. These may indicate the source of the program or the nature of the task being performed when the error occurred.\n    - Check whether the error is related to unsuccessful attempts to enumerate or access objects, data, or secrets.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the calling user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Consider the time of day. If the user is a human (not a program or script), did the activity take place during a normal time of day?\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity if suspicious.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Examine the history of the command. If the command only manifested recently, it might be part of a new automation module or script. If it has a consistent cadence (for example, it appears in small numbers on a weekly or monthly cadence), it might be part of a housekeeping or maintenance process. You can find the command in the `event.action field` field.\n- The adoption of new services or the addition of new functionality to scripts may generate false positives.\n\n### Related Rules\n\n- Unusual City For an AWS Command - 809b70d3-e2c3-455e-af1b-2626a5a1a276\n- Unusual Country For an AWS Command - dca28dee-c999-400f-b640-50a081cc0fd1\n- Unusual AWS Command for a User - ac706eae-d5ec-4b14-b4fd-e8ba8086f0e1\n- Rare AWS Error Code - 19de8096-e2b0-4bd8-80c9-34a820813fff\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Potential Shadow Credentials added to AD Object\n\nThe msDS-KeyCredentialLink is an Active Directory (AD) attribute that links cryptographic certificates to a user or computer for domain authentication.\n\nAttackers with write privileges on this attribute over an object can abuse it to gain access to the object or maintain persistence. This means they can authenticate and perform actions on behalf of the exploited identity, and they can use Shadow Credentials to request Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) on behalf of the identity.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify whether Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) and/or Azure AD is used in the environment.\n  - Review the event ID 4624 for logon events involving the subject identity (`winlog.event_data.SubjectUserName`).\n    - Check whether the `source.ip` is the server running Azure AD Connect.\n- Contact the account and system owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Review the event IDs 4768 and 4769 for suspicious ticket requests involving the modified identity (`winlog.event_data.ObjectDN`).\n  - Extract the source IP addresses from these events and use them as indicators of compromise (IoCs) to investigate whether the host is compromised and to scope the attacker's access to the environment.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Administrators might use custom accounts on Azure AD Connect. If this is the case, make sure the account is properly secured. You can also create an exception for the account if expected activity makes too much noise in your environment.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n  - Remove the Shadow Credentials from the object.\n- Investigate how the attacker escalated privileges and identify systems they used to conduct lateral movement. Use this information to determine ways the attacker could regain access to the environment.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This can happen by running commands to enumerate network resources, users, connections, files, and installed security software.\n\nThis rule looks for the execution of the `net` utility to enumerate servers in the environment that hosts shared drives or printers. This information is useful to attackers as they can identify targets for lateral movements and search for valuable shared data.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Discovery activities are not inherently malicious if they occur in isolation. As long as the analyst did not identify suspicious activity related to the user or host, such alerts can be dismissed.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check whether it makes sense for the user to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Investigate if PowerShell scripts were run after logging was disabled.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- PowerShell Suspicious Discovery Related Windows API Functions - 61ac3638-40a3-44b2-855a-985636ca985e\n- PowerShell Keylogging Script - bd2c86a0-8b61-4457-ab38-96943984e889\n- PowerShell Suspicious Script with Audio Capture Capabilities - 2f2f4939-0b34-40c2-a0a3-844eb7889f43\n- Potential Process Injection via PowerShell - 2e29e96a-b67c-455a-afe4-de6183431d0d\n- Suspicious .NET Reflection via PowerShell - e26f042e-c590-4e82-8e05-41e81bd822ad\n- PowerShell Suspicious Payload Encoded and Compressed - 81fe9dc6-a2d7-4192-a2d8-eed98afc766a\n- PowerShell Suspicious Script with Screenshot Capabilities - 959a7353-1129-4aa7-9084-30746b256a70\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Some hives store credential material, such as the SAM hive, which stores locally cached credentials (SAM secrets), and the SECURITY hive, which stores domain cached credentials (LSA secrets). Dumping these hives in combination with the SYSTEM hive enables the attacker to decrypt these secrets.\n\nAttackers can use tools like secretsdump.py or CrackMapExec to dump the registry hives remotely, and use dumped credentials to access other systems in the domain.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the specifics of the involved assets, such as their role, criticality, and associated users.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Determine the privileges of the compromised accounts.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/source host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (e.g., 4624) to the target host.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Any activity that triggered the alert and is not inherently malicious must be monitored by the security team.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Credential Acquisition via Registry Hive Dumping - a7e7bfa3-088e-4f13-b29e-3986e0e756b8\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Determine if other hosts were compromised.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Reimage the host operating system or restore the compromised files to clean versions.\n- Ensure that the machine has the latest security updates and is not running unsupported Windows versions.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Suspicious PowerShell Engine ImageLoad\n\nPowerShell is one of the main tools system administrators use for automation, report routines, and other tasks. This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nAttackers can use PowerShell without having to execute `PowerShell.exe` directly. This technique, often called \"PowerShell without PowerShell,\" works by using the underlying System.Management.Automation namespace and can bypass application allowlisting and PowerShell security features.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate abnormal behaviors observed by the subject process, such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n- Retrieve the implementation (DLL, executable, etc.) and determine if it is malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity can happen legitimately. Some vendors have their own PowerShell implementations that are shipped with some products. These benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary after analysis.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\n\n\nIf enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.",

This can happen by running commands to enumerate network resources, users, connections, files, and installed security software.\n\nThis rule looks for the execution of the `grep` utility with arguments compatible to the enumeration of the security software installed on the host. Attackers can use this information to decide whether or not to infect a system, disable protections, use bypasses, etc.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence and whether they are located in expected locations.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity, or legitimate software installations.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Discovery activities are not inherently malicious if they occur in isolation. As long as the analyst did not identify suspicious activity related to the user or host, such alerts can be dismissed.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

It may indicate an attempt to execute a malicious JAR file or an exploitation attempt via a Java specific vulnerability.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence and whether they are located in expected locations.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Examine the command line to determine if the command executed is potentially harmful or malicious.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this activity is expected and noisy in your environment, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of process and command line conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Systems with this setting enabled will communicate with other systems using broadcast messages, which can be used to identify targets for lateral movement. This rule looks for the setup of this setting using the netsh utility.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the Administrator is aware of the activity and there are justifications for this configuration.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Disable Network Discovery:\n    - Using netsh: `netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\"Network Discovery\" new enable=No`\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Unusual Child Process of dns.exe\n\nSIGRed (CVE-2020-1350) is a wormable, critical vulnerability in the Windows DNS server that affects Windows Server versions 2003 to 2019 and can be triggered by a malicious DNS response. Because the service is running in elevated privileges (SYSTEM), an attacker that successfully exploits it is granted Domain Administrator rights. This can effectively compromise the entire corporate infrastructure.\n\nThis rule looks for unusual children of the `dns.exe` process, which can indicate the exploitation of the SIGRed or a similar remote code execution vulnerability in the DNS server.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes.\n  - Any suspicious or abnormal child process spawned from dns.exe should be carefully reviewed and investigated. It's impossible to predict what an adversary may deploy as the follow-on process after the exploit, but built-in discovery/enumeration utilities should be top of mind (`whoami.exe`, `netstat.exe`, `systeminfo.exe`, `tasklist.exe`).\n  - Built-in Windows programs that contain capabilities used to download and execute additional payloads should also be considered. This is not an exhaustive list, but ideal candidates to start out would be: `mshta.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, `wscript.exe`, `wmic.exe`.\n  - If a denial-of-service (DoS) exploit is successful and DNS Server service crashes, be mindful of potential child processes related to `werfault.exe` occurring.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the host during the past 48 hours.\n- Check whether the server is vulnerable to CVE-2020-1350.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Reimage the host operating system or restore the compromised server to a clean state.\n- Install the latest patches on systems that run Microsoft DNS Server.\n- Consider the implementation of a patch management system, such as the Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\n",

This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nAttackers can abuse PowerShell capabilities to get the contents of the clipboard with the goal of stealing credentials and other valuable information, such as credit card data and confidential conversations.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Examine file or network events from the involved PowerShell process for suspicious behavior.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Determine whether the script stores the captured data locally.\n- Investigate whether the script contains exfiltration capabilities and identify the exfiltration server.\n- Assess network data to determine if the host communicated with the exfiltration server.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Regular users are unlikely to use scripting utilities to capture contents of the clipboard, making false positives unlikely. In the case of authorized benign true positives (B-TPs), exceptions can be added.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- PowerShell Keylogging Script - bd2c86a0-8b61-4457-ab38-96943984e889\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Prioritize the response if this alert involves key executives or potentially valuable targets for espionage.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

By monitoring these events and understanding what is considered normal behavior within an organization, you can spot suspicious or malicious activity when deviations occur.\n\nThis rule uses a machine learning job to detect an AWS API command that while not inherently suspicious or abnormal, is sourcing from a geolocation (city) that is unusual for the command. This can be the result of compromised credentials or keys used by a threat actor in a different geography than the authorized user(s).\n\nDetection alerts from this rule indicate an AWS API command or method call that is rare and unusual for the geolocation of the source IP address.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account involved and the action performed. Verify whether it should perform this kind of action.\n    - Examine the user identity in the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` field and the access key ID in the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` field, which can help identify the precise user context.\n    - The user agent details in the `user_agent.original` field may also indicate what kind of a client made the request.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, or network administrator activity.\n- Examine the request parameters. These might indicate the source of the program or the nature of its tasks.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the calling user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Consider the time of day. If the user is a human (not a program or script), did the activity take place during a normal time of day?\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity if suspicious.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- False positives can occur if activity is coming from new employees based in a city with no previous history in AWS.\n- Examine the history of the command. If the command only manifested recently, it might be part of a new automation module or script. If it has a consistent cadence (for example, it appears in small numbers on a weekly or monthly cadence), it might be part of a housekeeping or maintenance process. You can find the command in the `event.action field` field.\n\n### Related Rules\n\n- Unusual Country For an AWS Command - dca28dee-c999-400f-b640-50a081cc0fd1\n- Unusual AWS Command for a User - ac706eae-d5ec-4b14-b4fd-e8ba8086f0e1\n- Rare AWS Error Code - 19de8096-e2b0-4bd8-80c9-34a820813fff\n- Spike in AWS Error Messages - 78d3d8d9-b476-451d-a9e0-7a5addd70670\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Consider changing this interval to a lower value, such as 10 minutes (10m).\n- See the following references for further information:\n  - https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566\n  - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html",

These features can be used remotely for a variety of legitimate reasons, but at the same time used by malware and adversaries. When investigating scheduled tasks that were set up remotely, one of the first steps should be to determine the original intent behind the configuration and to verify if the activity is tied to benign behavior such as software installation or any kind of network administrator work. One objective for these alerts is to understand the configured action within the scheduled task. This is captured within the registry event data for this rule and can be base64 decoded to view the value.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Review the base64 encoded tasks actions registry value to investigate the task configured action.\n- Validate if the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity, or legitimate software installations.\n- Further examination should include review of host-based artifacts and network logs from around when the scheduled task was created, on both the source and target machines.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- There is a high possibility of benign activity tied to the creation of remote scheduled tasks as it is a general feature within Windows and used for legitimate purposes for a wide range of activity. Any kind of context should be found to further understand the source of the activity and determine the intent based on the scheduled task's contents.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Service Command Lateral Movement - d61cbcf8-1bc1-4cff-85ba-e7b21c5beedc\n- Remotely Started Services via RPC - aa9a274d-6b53-424d-ac5e-cb8ca4251650\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Remove scheduled task and any other related artifacts.\n- Review privileged account management and user account management settings. Consider implementing group policy object (GPO) policies to further restrict activity, or configuring settings that only allow administrators to create remote scheduled tasks.\n",

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Examine file or network events from the involved PowerShell process for suspicious behavior.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Determine whether the script stores the captured data locally.\n- Investigate whether the script contains exfiltration capabilities and identify the exfiltration server.\n- Assess network data to determine if the host communicated with the exfiltration server.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Regular users do not have a business justification for using scripting utilities to take screenshots, which makes false positives unlikely. In the case of authorized benign true positives (B-TPs), exceptions can be added.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- PowerShell Keylogging Script - bd2c86a0-8b61-4457-ab38-96943984e889\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS EC2 Snapshot Activity\n\nAmazon EC2 snapshots are a mechanism to create point-in-time references to data that reside in storage volumes. System administrators commonly use this for backup operations and data recovery.\n\nThis rule looks for the modification of snapshot attributes using the API `ModifySnapshotAttribute` action. This can be used to share snapshots with unauthorized third parties, giving others access to all the data on the snapshot.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Search for dry run attempts against the resource ID of the snapshot from other user accounts within CloudTrail.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences involving other users.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the calling user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- Check if the shared permissions of the snapshot were modified to `Public` or include unknown account IDs.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and IP address conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This could indicate attempts to enumerate users, password spraying, brute force, etc.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the users involved and if the activity targets a specific user or a set of users.\n- Check if the authentication comes from different sources.\n- Investigate if the host where the failed authentication events occur is exposed to the internet.\n  - If the host is exposed to the internet, and the source of these attempts is external, the activity can be related to bot activity and possibly not directed at your organization.\n  - If the host is not exposed to the internet, investigate the hosts where the authentication attempts are coming from, as this can indicate that they are compromised and the attacker is trying to move laterally.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the involved users and hosts during the past 48 hours.\n- Check whether the involved credentials are used in automation or scheduled tasks.\n- If this activity is suspicious, contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of it.\n- Investigate whether there are successful authentication events from the involved sources. This could indicate a successful brute force or password spraying attack.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If the account is used in automation tasks, it is possible that they are using expired credentials, causing a spike in authentication failures.\n- Authentication failures can be related to permission issues.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Assess whether the asset should be exposed to the internet, and take action to reduce your attack surface.\n  - If the asset needs to be exposed to the internet, restrict access to remote login services to specific IPs.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Attackers can abuse this mechanism to route traffic to malicious infrastructure or disrupt security that depends on server communications. For example, Russian threat actors modified this file on a domain controller to redirect Duo MFA calls to localhost instead of the Duo server, which prevented the MFA service from contacting its server to validate MFA login. This effectively disabled MFA for active domain accounts because the default policy of Duo for Windows is to \"Fail open\" if the MFA server is unreachable. This can happen in any MFA implementation and is not exclusive to Duo. Find more details in this [CISA Alert](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-074a).\n\nThis rule identifies modifications in the hosts file across multiple operating systems using process creation events for Linux and file events in Windows and macOS.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the specifics of the involved assets, such as role, criticality, and associated users.\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Examine the changes to the hosts file by comparing it against file backups, volume shadow copies, and other restoration mechanisms.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the administrator is aware of the activity and the configuration was justified.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Consider isolating the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Review the privileges of the administrator account that performed the action.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

These features can be used remotely for a variety of legitimate reasons, but at the same time used by malware and adversaries. When investigating scheduled tasks that were set up remotely, one of the first steps should be to determine the original intent behind the configuration and to verify if the activity is tied to benign behavior such as software installation or any kind of network administrator work. One objective for these alerts is to understand the configured action within the scheduled task. This is captured within the registry event data for this rule and can be base64 decoded to view the value.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Review the TaskContent value to investigate the task configured action.\n- Validate if the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity, or legitimate software installations.\n- Further examination should include review of host-based artifacts and network logs from around when the scheduled task was created, on both the source and target machines.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- There is a high possibility of benign activity tied to the creation of remote scheduled tasks as it is a general feature within Windows and used for legitimate purposes for a wide range of activity. Any kind of context should be found to further understand the source of the activity and determine the intent based on the scheduled task's contents.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Service Command Lateral Movement - d61cbcf8-1bc1-4cff-85ba-e7b21c5beedc\n- Remotely Started Services via RPC - aa9a274d-6b53-424d-ac5e-cb8ca4251650\n- Remote Scheduled Task Creation - 954ee7c8-5437-49ae-b2d6-2960883898e9\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Remove scheduled task and any other related artifacts.\n- Review privileged account management and user account management settings. Consider implementing group policy object (GPO) policies to further restrict activity, or configuring settings that only allow administrators to create remote scheduled tasks.\n",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Potential Credential Access via DCSync\n\nActive Directory replication is the process by which the changes that originate on one domain controller are automatically transferred to other domain controllers that store the same data.\n\nActive Directory data consists of objects that have properties, or attributes. Each object is an instance of an object class, and object classes and their respective attributes are defined in the Active Directory schema. Objects are defined by the values of their attributes, and changes to attribute values must be transferred from the domain controller on which they occur to every other domain controller that stores a replica of an affected object.\n\nAdversaries can use the DCSync technique that uses Windows Domain Controller's API to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller, compromising major credential material such as the Kerberos krbtgt keys used legitimately for tickets creation, but also tickets forging by attackers. This attack requires some extended privileges to succeed (DS-Replication-Get-Changes and DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All), which are granted by default to members of the Administrators, Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, and Domain Controllers groups. Privileged accounts can be abused to grant controlled objects the right to DCsync/Replicate.\n\nMore details can be found on [Threat Hunter Playbook](https://threathunterplaybook.com/library/windows/active_directory_replication.html?highlight=dcsync#directory-replication-services-auditing) and [The Hacker Recipes](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/credentials/dumping/dcsync).\n\nThis rule monitors for Event ID 4662 (Operation was performed on an Active Directory object) and identifies events that use the access mask 0x100 (Control Access) and properties that contain at least one of the following or their equivalent: Schema-Id-GUID (DS-Replication-Get-Changes, DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All, DS-Replication-Get-Changes-In-Filtered-Set). It also filters out events that use computer accounts and also Azure AD Connect MSOL accounts (more details [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-identity/ad-connect-msol-user-suspected-dcsync-attack/m-p/788028)).\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account and system owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Correlate security events 4662 and 4624 (Logon Type 3) by their Logon ID (`winlog.logon.id`) on the Domain Controller (DC) that received the replication request. This will tell you where the AD replication request came from, and if it came from another DC or not.\n- Scope which credentials were compromised (for example, whether all accounts were replicated or specific ones).\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Administrators may use custom accounts on Azure AD Connect, investigate if it is the case, and if it is properly secured. If noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding the corresponding account as a exception.\n- Although replicating Active Directory (AD) data to non-Domain Controllers is not a common practice and is generally not recommended from a security perspective, some software vendors may require it for their products to function correctly. If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding the corresponding account as a exception.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- If specific credentials were compromised:\n  - Reset the password for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, like email, business systems, and web services.\n- If the entire domain or the `krbtgt` user were compromised:\n  - Activate your incident response plan for total Active Directory compromise which should include, but not be limited to, a password reset (twice) of the `krbtgt` user.\n- Investigate how the attacker escalated privileges and identify systems they used to conduct lateral movement. Use this information to determine ways the attacker could regain access to the environment.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Suspicious user agent values include non-SDK, AWS CLI, custom user agents, etc.\n- Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences involving other users.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the calling user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Review IAM permission policies for the user identity and specific secrets accessed.\n- Examine the request parameters. These might indicate the source of the program or the nature of its tasks.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- False positives may occur due to the intended usage of the service. Tuning is needed in order to have higher confidence. Consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user agent and IP address conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Rotate secrets or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

It effectively redirects the system's input and output and delivers a fully functional remote shell to the attacker. Even private systems are vulnerable since the connection is outgoing. This activity is typically the result of vulnerability exploitation, malware infection, or penetration testing.\n\nThis rule identifies commands that are potentially related to reverse shell activities using shell applications.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the command line and extract the target domain or IP address information.\n  - Check if the domain is newly registered or unexpected.\n  - Check the reputation of the domain or IP address.\n  - Scope other potentially compromised hosts in your environment by mapping hosts that also communicated with the domain or IP address.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Any activity that triggered the alert and is not inherently malicious must be monitored by the security team.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Take actions to terminate processes and connections used by the attacker.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nEmail mailboxes and their information can be valuable assets for attackers. Company mailboxes often contain sensitive information such as login credentials, intellectual property, financial data, and personal information, making them high-value targets for malicious actors.\n\nThis rule identifies scripts that contains methods and classes that can be abused to collect emails from local and remote mailboxes.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Determine whether the script was executed and capture relevant information, such as arguments that reveal intent or are indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Determine whether the script stores the captured data locally.\n- Investigate whether the script contains exfiltration capabilities and identify the exfiltration server.\n  - Assess network data to determine if the host communicated with the exfiltration server.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the administrator is aware of the activity and it is done with proper approval.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Exporting Exchange Mailbox via PowerShell - 6aace640-e631-4870-ba8e-5fdda09325db\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- If the involved host is not the Exchange server, isolate the host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Prioritize cases that involve personally identifiable information (PII) or other classified data.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Some hives store credential material, as is the case for the SAM hive, which stores locally cached credentials (SAM secrets), and the SECURITY hive, which stores domain cached credentials (LSA secrets). Dumping these hives in combination with the SYSTEM hive enables the attacker to decrypt these secrets.\n\nAttackers can try to evade detection on the host by transferring this data to a system that is not monitored to be parsed and decrypted. This rule identifies the creation or modification of a medium-size registry hive file on an SMB share, which may indicate this kind of exfiltration attempt.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/source host during the past 48 hours.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Inspect the source host for suspicious or abnormal behaviors in the alert timeframe.\n- Capture the registry file(s) to determine the extent of the credential compromise in an eventual incident response.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Administrators can export registry hives for backup purposes. Check whether the user should be performing this kind of activity and is aware of it.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Credential Acquisition via Registry Hive Dumping - a7e7bfa3-088e-4f13-b29e-3986e0e756b8\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Reimage the host operating system and restore compromised files to clean versions.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.\n\nThe role trust policy is a JSON document in which you define the principals you trust to assume the role. This policy is a required resource-based policy that is attached to a role in IAM. An attacker may attempt to modify this policy by using the `UpdateAssumeRolePolicy` API action to gain the privileges of that role.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- False positives may occur due to the intended usage of the service. Tuning is needed in order to have higher confidence. Consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of the user agent and user ID conditions — to cover administrator activities and infrastructure as code tooling.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Use AWS [policy versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-versioning.html) to restore the trust policy to the desired state.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Suspicious MS Office Child Process\n\nMicrosoft Office (MS Office) is a suite of applications designed to help with productivity and completing common tasks on a computer. You can create and edit documents containing text and images, work with data in spreadsheets and databases, and create presentations and posters. As it is some of the most-used software across companies, MS Office is frequently targeted for initial access. It also has a wide variety of capabilities that attackers can take advantage of.\n\nThis rule looks for suspicious processes spawned by MS Office programs. This is generally the result of the execution of malicious documents.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Retrieve MS Office documents received and opened by the user that could cause this behavior. Common locations include, but are not limited to, the Downloads and Document folders and the folder configured at the email client.\n- Determine if the collected files are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n  - If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:\n    - Block the email sender from sending future emails.\n    - Block the malicious web pages.\n    - Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes.\n    - Consider improvements to the security awareness program.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Credential Acquisition via Registry Hive Dumping\n\nDumping registry hives is a common way to access credential information as some hives store credential material.\n\nFor example, the SAM hive stores locally cached credentials (SAM Secrets), and the SECURITY hive stores domain cached credentials (LSA secrets).\n\nDumping these hives in combination with the SYSTEM hive enables the attacker to decrypt these secrets.\n\nThis rule identifies the usage of `reg.exe` to dump SECURITY and/or SAM hives, which potentially indicates the compromise of the credentials stored in the host.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate if the credential material was exfiltrated or processed locally by other tools.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (e.g., 4624) to the target host.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Administrators can export registry hives for backup purposes using command line tools like `reg.exe`. Check whether the user is legitamitely performing this kind of activity.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Registry Hive File Creation via SMB - a4c7473a-5cb4-4bc1-9d06-e4a75adbc494\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Reimage the host operating system and restore compromised files to clean versions.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Consider changing this interval to a lower value, such as 10 minutes (10m).\n- See the following references for further information:\n  - https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566\n  - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html",

By monitoring these events and understanding what is considered normal behavior within an organization, you can spot suspicious or malicious activity when deviations occur.\n\nThis rule uses a machine learning job to detect an AWS API command that while not inherently suspicious or abnormal, is being made by a user context that does not normally use the command. This can be the result of compromised credentials or keys as someone uses a valid account to persist, move laterally, or exfiltrate data.\n\nDetection alerts from this rule indicate an AWS API command or method call that is rare and unusual for the calling IAM user.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account involved and the action performed. Verify whether it should perform this kind of action.\n    - Examine the user identity in the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` field and the access key ID in the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` field, which can help identify the precise user context.\n    - The user agent details in the `user_agent.original` field may also indicate what kind of a client made the request.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, or network administrator activity.\n- Examine the request parameters. These might indicate the source of the program or the nature of its tasks.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the calling user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Consider the time of day. If the user is a human (not a program or script), did the activity take place during a normal time of day?\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity if suspicious.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Examine the history of the command. If the command only manifested recently, it might be part of a new automation module or script. If it has a consistent cadence (for example, it appears in small numbers on a weekly or monthly cadence), it might be part of a housekeeping or maintenance process. You can find the command in the `event.action field` field.\n\n### Related Rules\n\n- Unusual City For an AWS Command - 809b70d3-e2c3-455e-af1b-2626a5a1a276\n- Unusual Country For an AWS Command - dca28dee-c999-400f-b640-50a081cc0fd1\n- Rare AWS Error Code - 19de8096-e2b0-4bd8-80c9-34a820813fff\n- Spike in AWS Error Messages - 78d3d8d9-b476-451d-a9e0-7a5addd70670\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This tool is commonly abused by adversaries during the post-compromise stage where adversaries have gained an initial foothold on an endpoint and are looking to elevate privileges and seek out additional authentication objects such as tokens/hashes/credentials that can then be used to move laterally and pivot across a network.\n\nThis rule looks for PowerShell scripts that load mimikatz in memory, like Invoke-Mimikataz, which are used to dump credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). Any activity triggered from this rule should be treated with high priority as it typically represents an active adversary.\n\nMore information about Mimikatz components and how to detect/prevent them can be found on [ADSecurity](https://adsecurity.org/?page_id=1821).\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Examine file or network events from the involved PowerShell process for suspicious behavior.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n  - Invoke-Mimitakz and alike scripts heavily use other capabilities covered by other detections described in the \"Related Rules\" section.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host.\n  - Examine network and security events in the environment to identify potential lateral movement using compromised credentials.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- PowerShell PSReflect Script - 56f2e9b5-4803-4e44-a0a4-a52dc79d57fe\n- Suspicious .NET Reflection via PowerShell - e26f042e-c590-4e82-8e05-41e81bd822ad\n- PowerShell Suspicious Payload Encoded and Compressed - 81fe9dc6-a2d7-4192-a2d8-eed98afc766a\n- Potential Process Injection via PowerShell - 2e29e96a-b67c-455a-afe4-de6183431d0d\n- Mimikatz Memssp Log File Detected - ebb200e8-adf0-43f8-a0bb-4ee5b5d852c6\n- Modification of WDigest Security Provider - d703a5af-d5b0-43bd-8ddb-7a5d500b7da5\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Validate that cleartext passwords are disabled in memory for use with `WDigest`.\n- Look into preventing access to `LSASS` using capabilities such as LSA protection or antivirus/EDR tools that provide this capability.\n- Run a full antimalware scan.

This allows users to store work files and access them from anywhere. When called, Work Folders will automatically execute any Portable Executable (PE) named control.exe as an argument before accessing the synced share.\n\nUsing Work Folders to execute a masqueraded control.exe could allow an adversary to bypass application controls and increase privileges.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n    - Examine the location of the WorkFolders.exe binary to determine if it was copied to the location of the control.exe binary. It resides in the System32 directory by default.\n- Trace the activity related to the control.exe binary to identify any continuing intrusion activity on the host.\n- Review the control.exe binary executed with Work Folders to determine maliciousness such as additional host activity or network traffic.\n- Determine if control.exe was synced to sync share, indicating potential lateral movement.\n- Review how control.exe was originally delivered on the host, such as emailed, downloaded from the web, or written to\ndisk from a separate binary.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Windows Work Folders are used legitimately by end users and administrators for file sharing and syncing but not in the instance where a suspicious control.exe is passed as an argument.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Review the Work Folders synced share to determine if the control.exe was shared and if so remove it.\n- If no lateral movement was identified during investigation, take the affected host offline if possible and remove the control.exe binary as well as any additional artifacts identified during investigation.\n- Review integrating Windows Information Protection (WIP) to enforce data protection by encrypting the data on PCs using Work Folders.\n- Confirm with the user whether this was expected or not, and reset their password.",

Attackers can abuse its functionality for malicious purposes such creating bind shells or reverse shells to gain access to the target system.\n\nA reverse shell is a mechanism that's abused to connect back to an attacker-controlled system. It effectively redirects the system's input and output and delivers a fully functional remote shell to the attacker. Even private systems are vulnerable since the connection is outgoing.\n\nA bind shell is a type of backdoor that attackers set up on the target host and binds to a specific port to listen for an incoming connection from the attacker.\n\nThis rule identifies potential reverse shell or bind shell activity using Netcat by checking for the execution of Netcat followed by a network connection.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the command line to identify if the command is suspicious.\n- Extract and examine the target domain or IP address.\n  - Check if the domain is newly registered or unexpected.\n  - Check the reputation of the domain or IP address.\n  - Scope other potentially compromised hosts in your environment by mapping hosts that also communicated with the domain or IP address.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Netcat is a dual-use tool that can be used for benign or malicious activity. It is included in some Linux distributions, so its presence is not necessarily suspicious. Some normal use of this program, while uncommon, may originate from scripts, automation tools, and frameworks.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n- Take actions to terminate processes and connections used by the attacker.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Clearing Windows Console History\n\nPowerShell is one of the main tools system administrators use for automation, report routines, and other tasks. This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nAttackers can try to cover their tracks by clearing PowerShell console history. PowerShell has two different ways of logging commands: the built-in history and the command history managed by the PSReadLine module. This rule looks for the execution of commands that can clear the built-in PowerShell logs or delete the `ConsoleHost_history.txt` file.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n  - Verify if any other anti-forensics behaviors were observed.\n- Investigate the PowerShell logs on the SIEM to determine if there was suspicious behavior that an attacker may be trying to cover up.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n  - Ensure that PowerShell auditing policies and log collection are in place to grant future visibility.",

Example Path: \"\\\\DC.com\\SysVol\\DC.com\\Policies\\{PolicyGUID}\\Machine\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\SecEdit\\GptTmpl.inf\"\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- This attack abuses a legitimate mechanism of Active Directory, so it is important to determine whether the activity is legitimate and the administrator is authorized to perform this operation.\n- Retrieve the contents of the `GptTmpl.inf` file, and under the `Privilege Rights` section, look for potentially dangerous high privileges, for example: SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeEnableDelegationPrivilege, etc.\n- Inspect the user security identifiers (SIDs) associated with these privileges, and if they should have these privileges.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Inspect whether the user that has done the modifications should be allowed to. The user name can be found in the `winlog.event_data.SubjectUserName` field.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Scheduled Task Execution at Scale via GPO - 15a8ba77-1c13-4274-88fe-6bd14133861e\n- Startup/Logon Script added to Group Policy Object - 16fac1a1-21ee-4ca6-b720-458e3855d046\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- The investigation and containment must be performed in every computer controlled by the GPO, where necessary.\n- Remove the script from the GPO.\n- Check if other GPOs have suspicious scripts attached.",

Is this network activity part of an expected workflow for the user who ran the program?\n- Examine the history of execution. If this process only manifested recently, it might be part of a new software package. If it has a consistent cadence (for example if it runs monthly or quarterly), it might be part of a monthly or quarterly business process.\n- Examine the process arguments, title and working directory. These may provide indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is performing.\n- Consider the same for the parent process. If the parent process is a legitimate system utility or service, this could be related to software updates or system management. If the parent process is something user-facing like an Office application, this process could be more suspicious.\n- If you have file hash values in the event data, and you suspect malware, you can optionally run a search for the file hash to see if the file is identified as malware by anti-malware tools.",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS Root Login Without MFA\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) in AWS is a simple best practice that adds an extra layer of protection on top of your user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS Management Console, they will be prompted for their user name and password, as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device. Taken together, these multiple factors provide increased security for your AWS account settings and resources.\n\nFor more information about using MFA in AWS, access the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html).\n\nThe AWS root account is the one identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account, which is created when the AWS account is created. AWS strongly recommends that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks. Amazon provides a [list of the tasks that require root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root).\n\nThis rule looks for attempts to log in to AWS as the root user without using multi-factor authentication (MFA), meaning the account is not secured properly.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Examine whether this activity is common in the environment by looking for past occurrences on your logs.\n- Consider the source IP address and geolocation for the calling user who issued the command. Do they look normal for the calling user?\n- Examine the commands, API calls, and data management actions performed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking access to servers,\nservices, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- While this activity is not inherently malicious, the root account must use MFA. The security team should address any potential benign true positive (B-TP), as this configuration can risk the entire cloud environment.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Identify the services or servers involved criticality.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify if there are any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Configure multi-factor authentication for the user.\n- Follow security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This makes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nAttackers can abuse PowerShell capabilities to capture user keystrokes with the goal of stealing credentials and other valuable information as credit card data and confidential conversations.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the script content that triggered the detection; look for suspicious DLL imports, collection or exfiltration capabilities, suspicious functions, encoded or compressed data, and other potentially malicious characteristics.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Examine file or network events from the involved PowerShell process for suspicious behavior.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Evaluate whether the user needs to use PowerShell to complete tasks.\n- Determine whether the script stores the captured data locally.\n- Investigate whether the script contains exfiltration capabilities and identify the exfiltration server.\n- Assess network data to determine if the host communicated with the exfiltration server.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Regular users do not have a business justification for using scripting utilities to capture keystrokes, making false positives unlikely. In the case of authorized benign true positives (B-TPs), exceptions can be added.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- PowerShell PSReflect Script - 56f2e9b5-4803-4e44-a0a4-a52dc79d57fe\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Prioritize the response if this alert involves key executives or potentially valuable targets for espionage.\n- Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This rule identifies the loading of a non-Microsoft-signed DLL that is missing on a default Windows installation or one that can be loaded from a different location by a native Windows process.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the DLL signature and identify the process that created it.\n  - Investigate any abnormal behaviors by the process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Retrieve the DLL and determine if it is malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Any activity that triggered the alert and is not inherently malicious must be monitored by the security team.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Volume Shadow Copy Deleted or Resized via VssAdmin\n\nThe Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) is a Windows feature that enables system administrators to take snapshots of volumes that can later be restored or mounted to recover specific files or folders.\n\nA typical step in the playbook of an attacker attempting to deploy ransomware is to delete Volume Shadow Copies to ensure that victims have no alternative to paying the ransom, making any action that deletes shadow copies worth monitoring.\n\nThis rule monitors the execution of Vssadmin.exe to either delete or resize shadow copies.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- In the case of a resize operation, check if the resize value is equal to suspicious values, like 401MB.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- If unsigned files are found on the process tree, retrieve them and determine if they are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Use process name, command line, and file hash to search for occurrences in other hosts.\n- Check if any files on the host machine have been encrypted.\n\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This rule may produce benign true positives (B-TPs). If this activity is expected and noisy in your environment, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and command line conditions.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Volume Shadow Copy Deleted or Resized via VssAdmin - b5ea4bfe-a1b2-421f-9d47-22a75a6f2921\n- Volume Shadow Copy Deletion via PowerShell - d99a037b-c8e2-47a5-97b9-170d076827c4\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Consider isolating the involved host to prevent destructive behavior, which is commonly associated with this activity.\n- Priority should be given due to the advanced stage of this activity on the attack.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- If data was encrypted, deleted, or modified, activate your data recovery plan.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Perform data recovery locally or restore the backups from replicated copies (cloud, other servers, etc.).\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Microsoft Build Engine Started by an Office Application\n\nMicrosoft Office (MS Office) is a suite of applications designed to help with productivity and completing common tasks on a computer. You can create and edit documents containing text and images, work with data in spreadsheets and databases, and create presentations and posters. As it is some of the most-used software across companies, MS Office is frequently targeted for initial access. It also has a wide variety of capabilities that attackers can take advantage of.\n\nThe Microsoft Build Engine is a platform for building applications. This engine, also known as MSBuild, provides an XML schema for a project file that controls how the build platform processes and builds software, and can be abused to proxy execution of code.\n\nThis rule looks for the `Msbuild.exe` utility spawned by MS Office programs. This is generally the result of the execution of malicious documents.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate abnormal behaviors observed by the subject process, such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Retrieve MS Office documents received and opened by the user that could cause this behavior. Common locations include, but are not limited to, the Downloads and Document folders and the folder configured at the email client.\n- Determine if the collected files are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n  - If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:\n    - Block the email sender from sending future emails.\n    - Block the malicious web pages.\n    - Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes.\n    - Consider improvements to the security awareness program.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

For example, data exfiltration or infected machines may communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server in another country your company doesn't have business with.\n\nThis rule uses a machine learning job to detect a significant spike in the network traffic to a country, which can indicate reconnaissance or enumeration activities, an infected machine being used as a bot in a DDoS attack, or potentially data exfiltration.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the specifics of the involved assets, such as role, criticality, and associated users.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the involved assets during the past 48 hours.\n- Examine the data available and determine the exact users and processes involved in those connections.\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Consider the time of day. If the user is a human (not a program or script), did the activity occurs during working hours?\n- If this activity is suspicious, contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of it.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Understand the context of the connections by contacting the asset owners. If this activity is related to a new business process or newly implemented (approved) technology, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and source conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n  - Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Consider implementing temporary network border rules to block or alert connections to the target country, if relevant.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Disabling it is a common step in threat actor playbooks.\n\nThis rule monitors the execution of commands that can tamper the Windows Defender antivirus features.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity, or legitimate software installations.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Examine the command line to determine which action was executed. Based on that, examine exceptions, antivirus state, sample submission, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the administrator is aware of the activity, the configuration is justified (for example, it is being used to deploy other security solutions or troubleshooting), and no other suspicious activity has been observed.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Windows Defender Disabled via Registry Modification - 2ffa1f1e-b6db-47fa-994b-1512743847eb\n- Microsoft Windows Defender Tampering - fe794edd-487f-4a90-b285-3ee54f2af2d3\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Based on the command line, take actions to restore the appropriate Windows Defender antivirus configurations.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Abnormal Process ID or Lock File Created\n\nLinux applications may need to save their process identification number (PID) for various purposes: from signaling that a program is running to serving as a signal that a previous instance of an application didn't exit successfully. PID files contain its creator process PID in an integer value.\n\nLinux lock files are used to coordinate operations in files so that conflicts and race conditions are prevented.\n\nThis rule identifies the creation of PID, lock, or reboot files in the /var/run/ directory. Attackers can masquerade malware, payloads, staged data for exfiltration, and more as legitimate PID files.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Retrieve the file and determine if it is malicious:\n    - Check the contents of the PID files. They should only contain integer strings.\n    - Check the file type of the lock and PID files to determine if they are executables. This is only observed in     malicious files.\n    - Check the size of the subject file. Legitimate PID files should be under 10 bytes.\n    - Check if the lock or PID file has high entropy. This typically indicates an encrypted payload.\n        - Analysts can use tools like `ent` to measure entropy.\n    - Examine the reputation of the SHA-256 hash in the PID file. Use a database like VirusTotal to identify additional pivots and artifacts for investigation.\n- Trace the file's creation to ensure it came from a legitimate or authorized process.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n- Investigate any abnormal behavior by the subject process such as network connections, file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- False positives can appear if the PID file is legitimate and holding a process ID as intended. If the PID file is an executable or has a file size that's larger than 10 bytes, it should be ruled suspicious.\n- If this activity is expected and noisy in your environment, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of file name and process executable conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n- Take actions to terminate processes and connections used by the attacker.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Google Workspace MFA Enforcement Disabled\n\nMulti-factor authentication is a process in which users are prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification, such as a code on their cellphone or a fingerprint scan.\n\nIf you only use a password to authenticate a user, it leaves an insecure vector for attack. If the password is weak or has been exposed elsewhere, an attacker could be using it to gain access. When you require a second form of authentication, security is increased because this additional factor isn't something that's easy for an attacker to obtain or duplicate.\n\nFor more information about using MFA in Google Workspace, access the [official documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/175197).\n\nThis rule identifies the disabling of MFA enforcement in Google Workspace. This modification weakens the security of the accounts and can lead to the compromise of accounts and other assets.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- While this activity can be done by administrators, all users must use MFA. The security team should address any potential benign true positive (B-TP), as this configuration can risk the user and domain.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Reactivate the multi-factor authentication enforcement.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7587183) by Google.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\n\n\n### Important Information Regarding Google Workspace Event Lag Times\n\n- As per Google's documentation, Google Workspace administrators may observe lag times ranging from minutes up to 3 days between the time of an event's occurrence and the event being visible in the Google Workspace admin/audit logs.\n- This rule is configured to run every 10 minutes with a lookback time of 130 minutes.\n- To reduce the risk of false negatives, consider reducing the interval that the Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) Filebeat module polls Google's reporting API for new events.\n- By default, `var.interval` is set to 2 hours (2h). Consider changing this interval to a lower value, such as 10 minutes (10m).\n- See the following references for further information:\n  - https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566\n  - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Symbolic Link to Shadow Copy Created\n\nShadow copies are backups or snapshots of an endpoint's files or volumes while they are in use. Adversaries may attempt to discover and create symbolic links to these shadow copies in order to copy sensitive information offline. If Active Directory (AD) is in use, often the ntds.dit file is a target as it contains password hashes, but an offline copy is needed to extract these hashes and potentially conduct lateral movement.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Determine if a volume shadow copy was recently created on this endpoint.\n- Review privileges of the end user as this requires administrative access.\n- Verify if the ntds.dit file was successfully copied and determine its copy destination.\n- Investigate for registry SYSTEM file copies made recently or saved via Reg.exe.\n- Investigate recent deletions of volume shadow copies.\n- Identify other files potentially copied from volume shadow copy paths directly.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This rule should cause very few false positives. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- NTDS or SAM Database File Copied - 3bc6deaa-fbd4-433a-ae21-3e892f95624f\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- If the entire domain or the `krbtgt` user was compromised:\n  - Activate your incident response plan for total Active Directory compromise which should include, but not be limited to, a password reset (twice) of the `krbtgt` user.\n- Locate and remove static files copied from volume shadow copies.\n- Command-Line tool mklink should require administrative access by default unless in developer mode.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\nEnsure advanced audit policies for Windows are enabled, specifically:\nObject Access policies [Event ID 4656](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4656) (Handle to an Object was Requested)\n\n```\nComputer Configuration >\nPolicies >\nWindows Settings >\nSecurity Settings >\nAdvanced Audit Policies Configuration >\nSystem Audit Policies >\nObject Access >\nAudit File System (Success,Failure)\nAudit Handle Manipulation (Success,Failure)\n```\n\nThis event will only trigger if symbolic links are created from a new process spawning cmd.exe or powershell.exe with the correct arguments.\nDirect access to a shell and calling symbolic link creation tools will not generate an event matching this rule.\n\nIf enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.",

UAC can deny an operation under high-integrity enforcement, or allow the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and enter an administrator password when prompted.\n\nFor more information about the UAC and how it works, check the [official Microsoft docs page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works).\n\nAttackers may disable UAC to execute code directly in high integrity. This rule identifies registry value changes to bypass the UAC protection.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behaviors in the alert timeframe.\n- Investigate abnormal behaviors observed by the subject process such as network connections, registry or file modifications, and any spawned child processes.\n- Analyze non-system processes executed with high integrity after UAC was disabled for unknown or suspicious processes.\n- Retrieve the suspicious processes' executables and determine if they are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled tasks creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell `Get-FileHash` cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Restore UAC settings to the desired state.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n  - Verify if any other anti-forensics behaviors were observed.\n- Investigate the event logs prior to the action for suspicious behaviors that an attacker may be trying to cover up.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the administrator is aware of the activity and there are justifications for this action.\n- Analyze whether the cleared event log is pertinent to security and general monitoring. Administrators can clear non-relevant event logs using this mechanism. If this activity is expected and noisy in your environment, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and command line conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n  - This activity is potentially done after the adversary achieves its objectives on the host. Ensure that previous actions, if any, are investigated accordingly with their response playbooks.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS CloudWatch Log Stream Deletion\n\nAmazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events for resources and applications. This data can be used to detect anomalous behavior in your environments, set alarms, visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep your applications running smoothly.\n\nA log stream is a sequence of log events that share the same source. Each separate source of logs in CloudWatch Logs makes up a separate log stream.\n\nThis rule looks for the deletion of a log stream using the API `DeleteLogStream` action. Attackers can do this to cover their tracks and impact security monitoring that relies on these sources.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the calling user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Investigate the deleted log stream's criticality and whether the responsible team is aware of the deletion.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and IP address conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This can happen by running commands to enumerate network resources, users, connections, files, and installed security software.\n\nThis rule identifies commands to enumerate system information, files, and folders using the Windows Command Shell.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Discovery activities are not inherently malicious if they occur in isolation. As long as the analyst did not identify suspicious activity related to the user or host, such alerts can be dismissed.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Modification of WDigest Security Provider\n\nIn Windows XP, Microsoft added support for a protocol known as WDigest. The WDigest protocol allows clients to send cleartext credentials to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Authentication Security Layer (SASL) applications based on RFC 2617 and 2831. Windows versions up to 8 and 2012 store logon credentials in memory in plaintext by default, which is no longer the case with newer Windows versions.\n\nStill, attackers can force WDigest to store the passwords insecurely on the memory by modifying the `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\*ControlSet*\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest\\UseLogonCredential` registry key. This activity is commonly related to the execution of credential dumping tools.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- It is unlikely that the monitored registry key was modified legitimately in newer versions of Windows. Analysts should treat any activity triggered from this rule with high priority as it typically represents an active adversary.\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Determine if credential dumping tools were run on the host, and retrieve and analyze suspicious executables:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Use process name, command line, and file hash to search for occurrences on other hosts.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (for example, 4624) to the target host after the registry modification.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This modification should not happen legitimately. Any potential benign true positive (B-TP) should be mapped and monitored by the security team, as these modifications expose the entire domain to credential compromises and consequently unauthorized access.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Mimikatz Powershell Module Activity - ac96ceb8-4399-4191-af1d-4feeac1f1f46\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Reimage the host operating system and restore compromised files to clean versions.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS Management Console, they will be prompted for their user name and password (the first factor—what they know), as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device (the second factor—what they have). Taken together, these multiple factors provide increased security for your AWS account settings and resources.\n\nFor more information about using MFA in AWS, access the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html).\n\nThis rule looks for the deactivation or deletion of AWS MFA devices. These modifications weaken account security and can lead to the compromise of accounts and other assets.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- While this activity can be done by administrators, all users must use MFA. The security team should address any potential benign true positive (B-TP), as this configuration can risk the user and domain.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Reactivate multi-factor authentication for the user.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Perform data recovery locally or restore the backups from replicated copies (cloud, other servers, etc.).\n- Run a full antimalware scan.

If the password is weak or has been exposed elsewhere, an attacker could be using it to gain access. When you require a second form of authentication, security is increased because this additional factor isn't something that's easy for an attacker to obtain or duplicate.\n\nFor more information about using MFA in Azure AD, access the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks#how-to-enable-and-use-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication).\n\nThis rule identifies the deactivation of MFA for an Azure user account. This modification weakens account security and can lead to the compromise of accounts and other assets.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if this operation was approved and performed according to the organization's change management policy.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- While this activity can be done by administrators, all users must use MFA. The security team should address any potential benign true positive (B-TP), as this configuration can risk the user and domain.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Reactivate multi-factor authentication for the user.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security defaults [provided by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults).\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Volume Shadow Copy Deletion via WMIC\n\nThe Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) is a Windows feature that enables system administrators to take snapshots of volumes that can later be restored or mounted to recover specific files or folders.\n\nA typical step in the playbook of an attacker attempting to deploy ransomware is to delete Volume Shadow Copies to ensure that victims have no alternative to paying the ransom, making any action that deletes shadow copies worth monitoring.\n\nThis rule monitors the execution of `wmic.exe` to interact with VSS via the `shadowcopy` alias and delete parameter.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the program execution chain (parent process tree).\n- Check whether the account is authorized to perform this operation.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- In the case of a resize operation, check if the resize value is equal to suspicious values, like 401MB.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- If unsigned files are found on the process tree, retrieve them and determine if they are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Use process name, command line, and file hash to search for occurrences in other hosts.\n- Check if any files on the host machine have been encrypted.\n\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This rule has chances of producing benign true positives (B-TPs).

Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Perform data recovery locally or restore the backups from replicated copies (cloud, other servers, etc.).\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Unusual Country For an AWS Command\n\nCloudTrail logging provides visibility on actions taken within an AWS environment. By monitoring these events and understanding what is considered normal behavior within an organization, you can spot suspicious or malicious activity when deviations occur.\n\nThis rule uses a machine learning job to detect an AWS API command that while not inherently suspicious or abnormal, is sourcing from a geolocation (country) that is unusual for the command. This can be the result of compromised credentials or keys used by a threat actor in a different geography than the authorized user(s).\n\nDetection alerts from this rule indicate an AWS API command or method call that is rare and unusual for the geolocation of the source IP address.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account involved and the action performed. Verify whether it should perform this kind of action.\n    - Examine the user identity in the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` field and the access key ID in the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` field, which can help identify the precise user context.\n    - The user agent details in the `user_agent.original` field may also indicate what kind of a client made the request.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, or network administrator activity.\n- Examine the request parameters. These might indicate the source of the program or the nature of its tasks.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the calling user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- Consider the time of day. If the user is a human (not a program or script), did the activity take place during a normal time of day?\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity if suspicious.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- False positives can occur if activity is coming from new employees based in a country with no previous history in AWS.\n- Examine the history of the command. If the command only manifested recently, it might be part of a new automation module or script. If it has a consistent cadence (for example, it appears in small numbers on a weekly or monthly cadence), it might be part of a housekeeping or maintenance process. You can find the command in the `event.action field` field.\n\n### Related Rules\n\n- Unusual City For an AWS Command - 809b70d3-e2c3-455e-af1b-2626a5a1a276\n- Unusual AWS Command for a User - ac706eae-d5ec-4b14-b4fd-e8ba8086f0e1\n- Rare AWS Error Code - 19de8096-e2b0-4bd8-80c9-34a820813fff\n- Spike in AWS Error Messages - 78d3d8d9-b476-451d-a9e0-7a5addd70670\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

If this activity is related to a new business process or newly implemented (approved) technology, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and source conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

AWS strongly recommends that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks. AWS provides a [list of the tasks that require root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root).\n\nThis rule looks for attempts to log in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Examine whether this activity is common in the environment by looking for past occurrences on your logs.\n- Consider the source IP address and geolocation for the calling user who issued the command. Do they look normal for the calling user?\n- Examine the commands, API calls, and data management actions performed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking access to servers,\nservices, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- The alert can be dismissed if this operation is done under change management and approved according to the organization's policy for performing a task that needs this privilege level.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Identify the services or servers involved criticality.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify if there are any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Configure multi-factor authentication for the user.\n- Follow security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

It operates by executing a service component `Psexecsvc` on a remote system, which then runs a specified process and returns the results to the local system. Microsoft develops PsExec as part of the Sysinternals Suite. Although commonly used by administrators, PsExec is frequently used by attackers to enable lateral movement and execute commands as SYSTEM to disable defenses and bypass security protections.\n\nThis rule identifies instances where the PsExec service component is executed using a custom name. This behavior can indicate an attempt to bypass security controls or detections that look for the default PsExec service component name.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Check if the usage of this tool complies with the organization's administration policy.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Identify the target computer and its role in the IT environment.\n- Investigate what commands were run, and assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences across hosts.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. As long as the analyst did not identify suspicious activity related to the user or involved hosts, and the tool is allowed by the organization's policy, such alerts can be dismissed.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n  - Prioritize cases involving critical servers and users.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Kerberos Pre-authentication Disabled for User\n\nKerberos pre-authentication is an account protection against offline password cracking. When enabled, a user requesting access to a resource initiates communication with the Domain Controller (DC) by sending an Authentication Server Request (AS-REQ) message with a timestamp that is encrypted with the hash of their password. If and only if the DC is able to successfully decrypt the timestamp with the hash of the user’s password, it will then send an Authentication Server Response (AS-REP) message that contains the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to the user. Part of the AS-REP message is signed with the user’s password. Microsoft's security monitoring [recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4738) state that `'Don't Require Preauth' – Enabled` should not be enabled for user accounts because it weakens security for the account’s Kerberos authentication.\n\nAS-REP roasting is an attack against Kerberos for user accounts that do not require pre-authentication, which means that if the target user has pre-authentication disabled, an attacker can request authentication data for it and get a TGT that can be brute-forced offline, similarly to Kerberoasting.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Determine if the target account is sensitive or privileged.\n- Inspect the account activities for suspicious or abnormal behaviors in the alert timeframe.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Disabling pre-authentication is a bad security practice and should not be allowed in the domain. The security team should map and monitor any potential benign true positives (B-TPs), especially if the target account is privileged.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Reset the target account's password if there is any risk of TGTs having been retrieved.\n- Re-enable the preauthentication option or disable the target account.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Consider changing this interval to a lower value, such as 10 minutes (10m).\n- See the following references for further information:\n  - https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566\n  - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS IAM Brute Force of Assume Role Policy\n\nAn IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.\n\nAttackers may attempt to enumerate IAM roles in order to determine if a role exists before attempting to assume or hijack the discovered role.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Verify if the `RoleName` parameter contains a unique value in all requests or if the activity is potentially a brute force attack.\n- Verify if the user account successfully updated a trust policy in the last 24 hours.\n- Examine whether this role existed in the environment by looking for past occurrences in your logs.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Consider the time of day. If the user is a human (not a program or script), did the activity take place during a normal time of day?\n- Examine the account's commands, API calls, and data management actions in the last 24 hours.\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Verify the roles targeted in the failed attempts, and whether the subject role previously existed in the environment. If only one role was targeted in the requests and that role previously existed, it may be a false positive, since automations can continue targeting roles that existed in the environment in the past and cause false positives (FPs).\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate if the script was executed, and if so, which account was targeted.\n- Validate if the account has an SPN associated with it.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if the script has any other functionality that can be potentially malicious.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Review event ID [4769](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4769) related to this account and service name for additional information.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- A possible false positive can be identified if the script content is not malicious/harmful or does not request Kerberos tickets for user accounts, as computer accounts are not vulnerable to Kerberoasting due to complex password requirements and policy.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services. Prioritize privileged accounts.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This tool is commonly abused by adversaries during the post-compromise stage where adversaries have gained an initial foothold on an endpoint and are looking to elevate privileges and seek out additional authentication objects such as tokens/hashes/credentials that can then be used to laterally move and pivot across a network.\n\nThis rule looks for the creation of a file named `mimilsa.log`, which is generated when using the Mimikatz misc::memssp module, which injects a malicious Windows SSP to collect locally authenticated credentials, which includes the computer account password, running service credentials, and any accounts that logon.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate potentially compromised accounts. Analysts can do this by searching for login events (e.g., 4624) to the target host.\n- Retrieve and inspect the log file contents.\n- Search for DLL files created in the same location as the log file, and retrieve unsigned DLLs.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the SHA-256 hash value of these files.\n    - Search for the existence of these files in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n  - Identify the process that created the DLL using file creation events.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This file name `mimilsa.log` should not legitimately be created.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Mimikatz Powershell Module Activity - ac96ceb8-4399-4191-af1d-4feeac1f1f46\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the host is a Domain Controller (DC):\n  - Activate your incident response plan for total Active Directory compromise.\n  - Review the privileges assigned to users that can access the DCs to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed and reduce the attack surface.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Reboot the host to remove the injected SSP from memory.\n- Reimage the host operating system or restore compromised files to clean versions.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

It provides features for serving dynamic and static content, and can be managed through a graphical interface or command-line tools.\n\nIIS logging is a data source that can be used for security monitoring, forensics, and incident response. It contains mainly information related to requests done to the web server, and can be used to spot malicious activities like webshells. Adversaries can tamper, clear, and delete this data to evade detection, cover their tracks, and slow down incident response.\n\nThis rule monitors commands that disable IIS logging.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n  - Verify if any other anti-forensics behaviors were observed.\n- Verify whether the logs stored in the `C:\\inetpub\\logs\\logfiles\\w3svc1` directory were deleted after this action.\n- Check if this operation is done under change management and approved according to the organization's policy.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity is unlikely to happen legitimately. Benign true positives (B-TPs) can be added as exceptions if necessary.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Re-enable affected logging components, services, and security monitoring.\n- Run a full antimalware scan.

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AdFind Command Activity\n\n[AdFind](http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/) is a freely available command-line tool used to retrieve information from Active Directory (AD). Network discovery and enumeration tools like `AdFind` are useful to adversaries in the same ways they are effective for network administrators. This tool provides quick ability to scope AD person/computer objects and understand subnets and domain information. There are many [examples](https://thedfirreport.com/category/adfind/) of this tool being adopted by ransomware and criminal groups and used in compromises.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Examine the command line to determine what information was retrieved by the tool.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This rule has a high chance to produce false positives as it is a legitimate tool used by network administrators.\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and command line conditions.\n- Malicious behavior with `AdFind` should be investigated as part of a step within an attack chain. It doesn't happen in isolation, so reviewing previous logs/activity from impacted machines can be very telling.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Windows Network Enumeration - 7b8bfc26-81d2-435e-965c-d722ee397ef1\n- Enumeration of Administrator Accounts - 871ea072-1b71-4def-b016-6278b505138d\n- Enumeration Command Spawned via WMIPrvSE - 770e0c4d-b998-41e5-a62e-c7901fd7f470\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This can happen by running commands to enumerate network resources, users, connections, files, and installed security software.\n\nThis rule looks for the execution of the `whoami` utility. Attackers commonly use this utility to measure their current privileges, discover the current user, determine if a privilege escalation was successful, etc.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network connections.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Discovery activities are not inherently malicious if they occur in isolation. As long as the analyst did not identify suspicious activity related to the user or host, such alerts can be dismissed.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Account Discovery Command via SYSTEM Account - 2856446a-34e6-435b-9fb5-f8f040bfa7ed\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Delegation (constrained and unconstrained) can be configured for user and computer objects.\n\nEnabling unconstrained delegation for a computer causes the computer to store the ticket-granting ticket (TGT) in memory at any time an account connects to the computer, so it can be used by the computer for impersonation when needed. Risk is heightened if an attacker compromises computers with unconstrained delegation enabled, as they could extract TGTs from memory and then replay them to move laterally on the domain. If the attacker coerces a privileged user to connect to the server, or if the user does so routinely, the account will be compromised and the attacker will be able to pass-the-ticket to privileged assets.\n\nSeEnableDelegationPrivilege is a user right that is controlled within the Local Security Policy of a domain controller and is managed through Group Policy. This setting is named **Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation**.\n\nIt is critical to control the assignment of this privilege. A user with this privilege and write access to a computer can control delegation settings, perform the attacks described above, and harvest TGTs from any user that connects to the system.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate how the privilege was assigned to the user and who assigned it.\n- Investigate other potentially malicious activity that was performed by the user that assigned the privileges using the `user.id` and `winlog.activity_id` fields as a filter during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the users/host during the past 48 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- The SeEnableDelegationPrivilege privilege should not be assigned to users. If this rule is triggered in your environment legitimately, the security team should notify the administrators about the risks of using it.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- KRBTGT Delegation Backdoor - e052c845-48d0-4f46-8a13-7d0aba05df82\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Remove the privilege from the account.\n- Review the privileges of the administrator account that performed the action.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate commands executed by the spawned PowerShell process.\n- If unsigned files are found on the process tree, retrieve them and determine if they are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Determine how the script file was delivered (email attachment, dropped by other processes, etc.).\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- The usage of these script engines by regular users is unlikely. In the case of authorized benign true positives (B-TPs), exceptions can be added.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:\n  - Block the email sender from sending future emails.\n  - Block the malicious web pages.\n  - Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes.\n  - Consider improvements to the security awareness program.\n- Reimage the host operating system and restore compromised files to clean versions.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Inspect the host for suspicious or abnormal behavior in the alert timeframe.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Check whether the user is an administrator and is legitimately performing troubleshooting.\n- In case of an allowed benign true positive (B-TP), assess adding rules to allow needed traffic and re-enable the firewall.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Re-enable the firewall with its desired configurations.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS CloudWatch Alarm Deletion\n\nAmazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects monitoring and operational data in the form of\nlogs, metrics, and events for resources and applications. This data can be used to detect anomalous behavior in your environments, set alarms, visualize\nlogs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep your\napplications running smoothly.\n\nCloudWatch Alarms is a feature that allows you to watch CloudWatch metrics and to receive notifications when the metrics\nfall outside of the levels (high or low thresholds) that you configure.\n\nThis rule looks for the deletion of a alarm using the API `DeleteAlarms` action. Attackers can do this to cover their\ntracks and evade security defenses.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user account during the past 48 hours.\n- Contact the account and resource owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Check if there is a justification for this behavior.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- If this rule is noisy in your environment due to expected activity, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and IP address conditions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Check if unauthorized new users were created, remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

AMSI integrates with multiple Windows components, ranging from User Account Control (UAC) to VBA macros and PowerShell.\n\nSince AMSI is widely used across security products for increased visibility, attackers can disable it to evade detections that rely on it.\n\nThis rule monitors the modifications to the Software\\Microsoft\\Windows Script\\Settings\\AmsiEnable registry key.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate the execution of scripts and macros after the registry modification.\n- Retrieve scripts or Microsoft Office files and determine if they are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n- Use process name, command line, and file hash to search for occurrences on other hosts.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This modification should not happen legitimately. Any potential benign true positive (B-TP) should be mapped and monitored by the security team as these modifications expose the host to malware infections.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Microsoft Windows Defender Tampering - fe794edd-487f-4a90-b285-3ee54f2af2d3\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.\n  - Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.\n  - Stop suspicious processes.\n  - Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n  - Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.\n- Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Delete or set the key to its default value.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Disabling it is a common step in threat actor playbooks.\n\nThis rule monitors the registry for modifications that disable Windows Defender features.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity, or legitimate software installations.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Examine which features have been disabled, and check if this operation is done under change management and approved according to the organization's policy.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Analysts can dismiss the alert if the administrator is aware of the activity, the configuration is justified (for example, it is being used to deploy other security solutions or troubleshooting), and no other suspicious activity has been observed.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Windows Defender Disabled via Registry Modification - 2ffa1f1e-b6db-47fa-994b-1512743847eb\n- Disabling Windows Defender Security Settings via PowerShell - c8cccb06-faf2-4cd5-886e-2c9636cfcb87\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Take actions to restore the appropriate Windows Defender antivirus configurations.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating MS Office Macro Security Registry Modifications\n\nMacros are small programs that are used to automate repetitive tasks in Microsoft Office applications. Historically, macros have been used for a variety of reasons -- from automating part of a job, to building entire processes and data flows. Macros are written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and are saved as part of Microsoft Office files.\n\nMacros are often created for legitimate reasons, but they can also be written by attackers to gain access, harm a system, or bypass other security controls such as application allow listing. In fact, exploitation from malicious macros is one of the top ways that organizations are compromised today. These attacks are often conducted through phishing or spear phishing campaigns.\n\nAttackers can convince victims to modify Microsoft Office security settings, so their macros are trusted by default and no warnings are displayed when they are executed. These settings include:\n\n- *Trust access to the VBA project object model* - When enabled, Microsoft Office will trust all macros and run any code without showing a security warning or requiring user permission.\n- *VbaWarnings* - When set to 1, Microsoft Office will trust all macros and run any code without showing a security warning or requiring user permission.\n\nThis rule looks for registry changes affecting the conditions above.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Contact the user and check if the change was done manually.\n- Verify whether malicious macros were executed after the registry change.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Retrieve recently executed Office documents and determine if they are malicious:\n  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.\n    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:\n      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.\n      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.\n      - Service creation and launch activities.\n      - Scheduled task creation.\n  - Use the PowerShell Get-FileHash cmdlet to get the files' SHA-256 hash values.\n    - Search for the existence and reputation of the hashes in resources like VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, CISCO Talos, Any.run, etc.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This activity should not happen legitimately. The security team should address any potential benign true positive (B-TP), as this configuration can put the user and the domain at risk.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Reset the registry key value.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.\n- Explore using GPOs to manage security settings for Microsoft Office macros.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",
