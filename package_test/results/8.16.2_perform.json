This could be indicative of a brute force or password spraying attack, where an adversary may attempt to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by guessing the passwords.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Review the `source.ip` field to identify the IP address from which the high volume of failed login attempts originated.\n- Look into the `event.outcome` field to verify that these are indeed failed authentication attempts.\n- Determine the `user.name` or `user.email` related to these failed login attempts. If the attempts are spread across multiple accounts, it might indicate a password spraying attack.\n- Check the timeline of the events. Are the failed attempts spread out evenly, or are there burst periods, which might indicate an automated tool?\n- Determine the geographical location of the source IP. Is this location consistent with the user's typical login location?\n- Analyze any previous successful logins from this IP. Was this IP previously associated with successful logins?\n\n### False positive analysis:\n\n- A single user or automated process that attempts to authenticate using expired or wrong credentials multiple times may trigger a false positive.\n- Analyze the behavior of the source IP. If the IP is associated with legitimate users or services, it may be a false positive.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If you identify unauthorized access attempts, consider blocking the source IP at the firewall level.\n- Notify the users who are targeted by the attack. Ask them to change their passwords and ensure they use unique, complex passwords.\n- Enhance monitoring on the affected user accounts for any suspicious activity.\n- If the attack is persistent, consider implementing CAPTCHA or account lockouts after a certain number of failed login attempts.\n- If the attack is persistent, consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the affected user accounts.\n- Review and update your security policies based on the findings from the incident.",

Subsequently, leveraging social engineering, they may seek to reset the MFA credentials associated with an Okta account, especially in scenarios where Active Directory (AD) services are integrated with Okta. Successfully resetting MFA allows the unauthorized use of stolen credentials to gain access to the compromised Okta account. The attacker can then register their own device for MFA, paving the way for unfettered access to the user's Okta account and any associated SaaS applications. This is particularly alarming if the compromised account has administrative rights, as it could lead to widespread access to organizational resources and configurations.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Identify the user account associated with the Okta login attempt by examining the `user.name` field.\n- Identify the endpoint for the Credential Access alert for this user by examining the `host.name` and `host.id` fields from the alert document.\n- Cross-examine the Okta user and endpoint user to confirm that they are the same person.\n- Reach out to the user to confirm if they have intentionally reset their MFA credentials recently or asked for help in doing so.\n- If the user is unaware of the MFA reset, incident response may be required immediately to prevent further compromise.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- A Windows administrator may have triggered a low-fidelity credential access alert during a legitimate administrative action. Following this, the administrator may have reset the MFA credentials for themselves and then logged into the Okta console for AD directory services integration management.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- If confirmed that the user did not intentionally have their MFA factor reset, deactivate the user account.\n- After deactivation, reset the user's password and MFA factor to regain control of the account.\n    - Ensure that all user sessions are stopped during this process.\n- Immediately reset the user's AD password as well if Okta does not sync back to AD.\n- Forensic analysis on the user's endpoint may be required to determine the root cause of the compromise and identify the scope of the compromise.\n- Review Okta system logs to identify any other suspicious activity associated with the user account, such as creation of a backup account.\n- With the device ID captured from the MFA factor reset, search across all Okta logs for any other activity associated with the device ID.\n\n## Setup",

This may indicate that a shared device between users, or that a user is using a proxy to access multiple accounts for password spraying.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Identify the users involved in this action by examining the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, and `okta.actor.display_name` fields.\n- Determine the device client used for these actions by analyzing `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.zone`, `okta.client.device`, and `okta.client.id` fields.\n    - Since the device is behind a proxy, the `okta.client.ip` field will not be useful for determining the actual device IP address.\n- Review the `okta.request.ip_chain` field for more information about the geographic location of the proxy.\n- With Okta end users identified, review the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field.\n    - Historical analysis should indicate if this device token hash is commonly associated with the user.\n- Review the `okta.event_type` field to determine the type of authentication event that occurred.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.sso`, the user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.password`, the user may be using a proxy to access multiple accounts for password spraying.\n- Examine the `okta.outcome.result` field to determine if the authentication was successful.\n- Review the past activities of the actor(s) involved in this action by checking their previous actions.\n- Evaluate the actions that happened just before and after this event in the `okta.event_type` field to help understand the full context of the activity.\n    - This may help determine the authentication and authorization actions that occurred between the user, Okta and application.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- A user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n- Users may share an endpoint related to work or personal use in which separate Okta accounts are used.\n    - Architecturally, this shared endpoint may leverage a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n    - Shared systems such as Kiosks and conference room computers may be used by multiple users.\n    - Shared working spaces may have a single endpoint that is used by multiple users.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- Review the profile of the users involved in this action to determine if proxy usage may be expected.\n- If the user is legitimate and the authentication behavior is not suspicious based on device analysis, no action is required.\n- If the user is legitimate but the authentication behavior is suspicious, consider resetting passwords for the users involves and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n    - If MFA is already enabled, consider resetting MFA for the users.\n- If any of the users are not legitimate, consider deactivating the user's account.\n- Conduct a review of Okta policies and ensure they are in accordance with security best practices.\n- Check with internal IT teams to determine if the accounts involved recently had MFA reset at the request of the user.\n    - If so, confirm with the user this was a legitimate request.\n    - If so and this was not a legitimate request, consider deactivating the user's account temporarily.\n        - Reset passwords and reset MFA for the user.\n- If this is a false positive, consider adding the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field to the `exceptions` list in the rule.\n    - This will prevent future occurrences of this event for this device from triggering the rule.\n",

Review the `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.zone`, `okta.client.device`, and `okta.client.id` fields.\n- If the client is a device, check the `okta.device.id`, `okta.device.name`, `okta.device.os_platform`, `okta.device.os_version`, and `okta.device.managed` fields.\n- Review the past activities of the actor involved in this action by checking their previous actions.\n- Examine the `okta.request.ip_chain` field to potentially determine if the actor used a proxy or VPN to perform this action.\n- Evaluate the actions that happened just before and after this event in the `okta.event_type` field to help understand the full context of the activity.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- A user may be using a new device or location to sign in.\n- The Okta behavior detection may be incorrectly identifying a new authentication behavior and need adjusted.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- If the user is legitimate and the authentication behavior is not suspicious, no action is required.\n- If the user is legitimate but the authentication behavior is suspicious, consider resetting the user's password and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n    - If MFA is already enabled, consider resetting MFA for the user.\n- If the user is not legitimate, consider deactivating the user's account.\n- If this is a false positive, consider adjusting the Okta behavior detection settings.\n- Block the IP address or device used in the attempts if they appear suspicious, using the data from the `okta.client.ip` and `okta.device.id` fields.\n- Conduct a review of Okta policies and ensure they are in accordance with security best practices.",

If these match the actor's normal behavior, it might be a false positive.\n- Check if the actor is a known administrator or part of the IT team who might have a legitimate reason to deactivate a network zone.\n- Verify the actor's actions with any known planned changes or maintenance activities.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- If unauthorized access or actions are confirmed, immediately lock the affected actor account and require a password change.\n- Re-enable the deactivated network zone if it was deactivated without authorization.\n- Review and update the privileges of the actor who initiated the deactivation.\n- Check the security policies and procedures to identify any gaps and update them as necessary.\n- Implement additional monitoring and logging of Okta events to improve visibility of user actions.\n- Communicate and train the employees about the importance of following proper procedures for modifying network zone settings.",

However, some adversaries may abuse the system by repeatedly sending MFA push notifications until the user unwittingly approves the access.\n\nThis rule detects when a user denies MFA Okta Verify push notifications twice, followed by a successful authentication event within a 10-minute window. This sequence could indicate an adversary's attempt to bypass the Okta MFA policy.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Identify the user who received the MFA notifications by reviewing the `user.email` field.\n- Identify the time, source IP, and geographical location of the MFA requests and the subsequent successful login.\n- Review the `event.action` field to understand the nature of the events. It should include two `user.mfa.okta_verify.deny_push` actions and one `user.authentication.sso` action.\n- Ask the user if they remember receiving the MFA notifications and subsequently logging into their account.\n- Check if the MFA requests and the successful login occurred during the user's regular activity hours.\n- Look for any other suspicious activity on the account around the same time.\n- Identify whether the same pattern is repeated for other users in your organization. Multiple users receiving push notifications simultaneously might indicate a larger attack.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n\n- Determine if the MFA push notifications were legitimate. Sometimes, users accidentally trigger MFA requests or deny them unintentionally and later approve them.\n- Check if there are known issues with the MFA system causing false denials.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If unauthorized access is confirmed, initiate your incident response process.\n- Alert the user and your IT department immediately.\n- If possible, isolate the user's account until the issue is resolved.\n- Investigate the source of the unauthorized access.\n- If the account was accessed by an unauthorized party, determine the actions they took after logging in.\n- Consider enhancing your MFA policy to prevent such incidents in the future.\n- Encourage users to report any unexpected MFA notifications immediately.\n- Review and update your incident response plans and security policies based on the findings from the incident.",

This rule is designed to help identify suspicious authentication behavior that may be indicative of an attacker attempting to gain access to an Okta account while remaining anonymous. This rule leverages the New Terms rule type feature where the `okta.actor.id` value is checked against the previous 7 days of data to determine if the value has been seen before for this activity.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Identify the user involved in this action by examining the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, and `okta.actor.display_name` fields.\n- Determine the client used by the actor. Review the `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.zone`, `okta.client.device`, and `okta.client.id` fields.\n- Examine the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.flattened` field for more information about the proxy used.\n- Review the `okta.request.ip_chain` field for more information about the geographic location of the proxy.\n- Review the past activities of the actor involved in this action by checking their previous actions.\n- Evaluate the actions that happened just before and after this event in the `okta.event_type` field to help understand the full context of the activity.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- A user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- Review the profile of the user involved in this action to determine if proxy usage may be expected.\n- If the user is legitimate and the authentication behavior is not suspicious, no action is required.\n- If the user is legitimate but the authentication behavior is suspicious, consider resetting the user's password and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n    - If MFA is already enabled, consider resetting MFA for the user.\n- If the user is not legitimate, consider deactivating the user's account.\n- Conduct a review of Okta policies and ensure they are in accordance with security best practices.\n\n## Setup",

If these match the actor's typical behavior, it might be a false positive.\n- Check if the actor is a known administrator or a member of the IT team who might have a legitimate reason to delete a network zone.\n- Cross-verify the actor's actions with any known planned changes or maintenance activities.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If unauthorized access or actions are confirmed, immediately lock the affected actor's account and require a password change.\n- If a network zone was deleted without authorization, create a new network zone with similar settings as the deleted one.\n- Review and update the privileges of the actor who initiated the deletion.\n- Identify any gaps in the security policies and procedures and update them as necessary.\n- Implement additional monitoring and logging of Okta events to improve visibility of user actions.\n- Communicate and train the employees about the importance of following proper procedures for modifying network zone settings.",

Adversaries may do this to bypass security barriers and enable further malicious activities.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Identify the actor related to the alert by reviewing `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, or `okta.actor.display_name` fields in the alert.\n- Review the `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent` field to understand the device and software used by the actor.\n- Examine the `okta.outcome.reason` field for additional context around the deletion attempt.\n- Check the `okta.outcome.result` field to confirm the policy deletion attempt.\n- Check if there are multiple policy deletion attempts from the same actor or IP address (`okta.client.ip`).\n- Check for successful logins immediately following the policy deletion attempt.\n- Verify whether the actor's activity aligns with typical behavior or if any unusual activity took place around the time of the deletion attempt.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n\n- Check if there were issues with the Okta system at the time of the deletion attempt. This could indicate a system error rather than a genuine threat activity.\n- Check the geographical location (`okta.request.ip_chain.geographical_context`) and time of the deletion attempt. If these match the actor's normal behavior, it might be a false positive.\n- Verify the actor's administrative rights to ensure they are correctly configured.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If unauthorized policy deletion is confirmed, initiate the incident response process.\n- Immediately lock the affected actor account and require a password change.\n- Consider resetting MFA tokens for the actor and require re-enrollment.\n- Check if the compromised account was used to access or alter any sensitive data or systems.\n- If a specific deletion technique was used, ensure your systems are patched or configured to prevent such techniques.\n- Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n- Work with your IT team to minimize the impact on users and maintain business continuity.\n- If multiple accounts are affected, consider a broader reset or audit of MFA tokens.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/10/9-admin-best-practices-to-keep-your-org-secure/) by Okta.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This may indicate an authenticated session has been hijacked or is being used by multiple devices. Adversaries may hijack a session to gain unauthorized access to Okta admin console, applications, tenants, or other resources.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Since this is an ES|QL rule, the `okta.actor.alternate_id` and `okta.authentication_context.external_session_id` values can be used to pivot into the raw authentication events related to this alert.\n- Identify the users involved in this action by examining the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, and `okta.actor.display_name` fields.\n- Determine the device client used for these actions by analyzing `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.zone`, `okta.client.device`, and `okta.client.id` fields.\n- With Okta end users identified, review the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field.\n    - Historical analysis should indicate if this device token hash is commonly associated with the user.\n- Review the `okta.event_type` field to determine the type of authentication event that occurred.\n    - Authentication events have been filtered out to focus on Okta activity via established sessions.\n- Review the past activities of the actor(s) involved in this action by checking their previous actions.\n- Evaluate the actions that happened just before and after this event in the `okta.event_type` field to help understand the full context of the activity.\n    - This may help determine the authentication and authorization actions that occurred between the user, Okta and application.\n- Aggregate by `okta.actor.alternate_id` and `event.action` to determine the type of actions that are being performed by the actor(s) involved in this action.\n    - If various activity is reported that seems to indicate actions from separate users, consider deactivating the user's account temporarily.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- It is very rare that a legitimate user would have multiple device token hashes for a single Okta session as DT hashes do not change after an authenticated session is established.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- Consider stopping all sessions for the user(s) involved in this action.\n- If this does not appear to be a false positive, consider resetting passwords for the users involved and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n    - If MFA is already enabled, consider resetting MFA for the users.\n- If any of the users are not legitimate, consider deactivating the user's account.\n- Conduct a review of Okta policies and ensure they are in accordance with security best practices.\n- Check with internal IT teams to determine if the accounts involved recently had MFA reset at the request of the user.\n    - If so, confirm with the user this was a legitimate request.\n    - If so and this was not a legitimate request, consider deactivating the user's account temporarily.\n        - Reset passwords and reset MFA for the user.\n- Alternatively adding `okta.client.ip` or a CIDR range to the `exceptions` list can prevent future occurrences of this event from triggering the rule.\n    - This should be done with caution as it may prevent legitimate alerts from being generated.\n",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Possible Consent Grant Attack via Azure-Registered Application\n\nIn an illicit consent grant attack, the attacker creates an Azure-registered application that requests access to data such as contact information, email, or documents. The attacker then tricks an end user into granting that application consent to access their data either through a phishing attack, or by injecting illicit code into a trusted website. After the illicit application has been granted consent, it has account-level access to data without the need for an organizational account. Normal remediation steps like resetting passwords for breached accounts or requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) on accounts are not effective against this type of attack, since these are third-party applications and are external to the organization.\n\nOfficial Microsoft guidance for detecting and remediating this attack can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/detect-and-remediate-illicit-consent-grants).\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- From the Azure AD portal, Review the application that was granted permissions:\n  - Click on the `Review permissions` button on the `Permissions` blade of the application.\n  - An app should require only permissions related to the app's purpose. If that's not the case, the app might be risky.\n  - Apps that require high privileges or admin consent are more likely to be risky.\n- Investigate the app and the publisher. The following characteristics can indicate suspicious apps:\n  -  A low number of downloads.\n  -  Low rating or score or bad comments.\n  -  Apps with a suspicious publisher or website.\n  -  Apps whose last update is not recent. This might indicate an app that is no longer supported.\n- Export and examine the [Oauth app auditing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/manage-app-permissions#oauth-app-auditing) to identify users affected.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This mechanism can be used legitimately. Malicious applications abuse the same workflow used by legitimate apps. Thus, analysts must review each app consent to ensure that only desired apps are granted access.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Disable the malicious application to stop user access and the application access to your data.\n- Revoke the application Oauth consent grant. The `Remove-AzureADOAuth2PermissionGrant` cmdlet can be used to complete this task.\n- Remove the service principal application role assignment. The `Remove-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment` cmdlet can be used to complete this task.\n- Revoke the refresh token for all users assigned to the application. Azure provides a [playbook](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/Revoke-AADSignInSessions) for this task.\n- [Report](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/manage-app-permissions#send-feedback) the application as malicious to Microsoft.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment. Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Investigate the potential for data compromise from the user's email and file sharing services. Activate your Data Loss incident response playbook.\n- Disable the permission for a user to set consent permission on their behalf.\n  - Enable the [Admin consent request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow) feature.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS IAM User Created Access Keys For Another User\n\nAWS access keys created for IAM users or root user are long-term credentials that provide programmatic access to AWS.\nWith access to the `iam:CreateAccessKey` permission, a set of compromised credentials could be used to create a new\nset of credentials for another user for privilege escalation or as a means of persistence. This rule uses [ES|QL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/rules-ui-create.html#create-esql-rule)\nto look for use of the `CreateAccessKey` operation where the user.name is different from the user.target.name.\n\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify both related accounts and their role in the environment.\n- Review IAM permission policies for the user identities.\n- Identify the applications or users that should use these accounts.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the accounts during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate abnormal values in the `user_agent.original` field by comparing them with the intended and authorized usage and historical data. Suspicious user agent values include non-SDK, AWS CLI, custom user agents, etc.\n- Contact the account owners and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Considering the source IP address and geolocation of the user who issued the command:\n    - Do they look normal for the calling user?\n    - If the source is an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your accounts or is the source IP from an EC2 instance that's not under your control?\n    - If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of suspicious activity involving this instance?\n- If you suspect the account has been compromised, scope potentially compromised assets by tracking servers, services, and data accessed by the account in the last 24 hours.\n    - Determine what other API calls were made by the user.\n    - Assess whether this behavior is prevalent in the environment by looking for similar occurrences involving other users.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- False positives may occur due to the intended usage of the IAM `CreateAccessKey` operation. Verify the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` should use this operation against the `user.target.name` account.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Disable or limit the account during the investigation and response.\n    - Rotate user credentials\n    - Remove the newly created credentials from the affected user(s)\n- Identify the possible impact of the incident and prioritize accordingly; the following actions can help you gain context:\n    - Identify the account role in the cloud environment.\n    - Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n    - Work with your IT team to identify and minimize the impact on users.\n    - Identify if the attacker is moving laterally and compromising other accounts, servers, or services.\n    - Identify any regulatory or legal ramifications related to this activity.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified.\n    - Rotate secrets or delete API keys as needed to revoke the attacker's access to the environment.\n    - Work with your IT teams to minimize the impact on business operations during these actions.\n- Remove unauthorized new accounts, and request password resets for other IAM users.\n- Consider enabling multi-factor authentication for users.\n- Review the permissions assigned to the implicated user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/) by AWS.\n- Take the actions needed to return affected systems, data, or services to their normal operational levels.\n- Identify the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection via the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n",

Each preset comes with different default settings for Elastic Agent, you can further customize these later by configuring the Elastic Defend integration policy. [Helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html).\n- We suggest selecting \"Complete EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)\" as a configuration setting, that provides \"All events; all preventions\"\n- Enter a name for the agent policy in \"New agent policy name\". If other agent policies already exist, you can click the \"Existing hosts\" tab and select an existing policy instead.\nFor more details on Elastic Agent configuration settings, refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/8.10/agent-policy.html).\n- Click \"Save and Continue\".\n- To complete the integration, select \"Add Elastic Agent to your hosts\" and continue to the next section to install the Elastic Agent on your hosts.\nFor more details on Elastic Defend refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).\n",

Adversaries may attempt to launch an attack by using a list of known usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts from different locations.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Since this is an ES|QL rule, the `okta.actor.alternate_id` and `okta.client.id` values can be used to pivot into the raw authentication events related to this alert.\n- Identify the users involved in this action by examining the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, and `okta.actor.display_name` fields.\n- Determine the device client used for these actions by analyzing `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.zone`, `okta.client.device`, and `okta.client.id` fields.\n- With Okta end users identified, review the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field.\n    - Historical analysis should indicate if this device token hash is commonly associated with the user.\n- Review the `okta.event_type` field to determine the type of authentication event that occurred.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.sso`, the user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.password`, the user may be using a proxy to access multiple accounts for password spraying.\n    - If the event type is `user.session.start`, the source may have attempted to establish a session via the Okta authentication API.\n- Review the past activities of the actor(s) involved in this action by checking their previous actions.\n- Evaluate the actions that happened just before and after this event in the `okta.event_type` field to help understand the full context of the activity.\n    - This may help determine the authentication and authorization actions that occurred between the user, Okta and application.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- It is very rare that a legitimate user would have multiple sessions started from different geo-located countries in a short time frame.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- If the user is legitimate and the authentication behavior is not suspicious based on device analysis, no action is required.\n- If the user is legitimate but the authentication behavior is suspicious, consider resetting passwords for the users involves and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n    - If MFA is already enabled, consider resetting MFA for the users.\n- If any of the users are not legitimate, consider deactivating the user's account.\n- Conduct a review of Okta policies and ensure they are in accordance with security best practices.\n- Check with internal IT teams to determine if the accounts involved recently had MFA reset at the request of the user.\n    - If so, confirm with the user this was a legitimate request.\n    - If so and this was not a legitimate request, consider deactivating the user's account temporarily.\n        - Reset passwords and reset MFA for the user.\n- If this is a false positive, consider adding the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field to the `exceptions` list in the rule.\n    - This will prevent future occurrences of this event for this device from triggering the rule.\n    - Alternatively adding `okta.client.ip` or a CIDR range to the `exceptions` list can prevent future occurrences of this event from triggering the rule.\n        - This should be done with caution as it may prevent legitimate alerts from being generated.\n",

Okta MFA, like other MFA solutions, requires the user to provide multiple means of identification at login. An adversary might attempt to bypass Okta MFA to gain unauthorized access to an application.\n\nThis rule detects attempts to bypass Okta MFA. It might indicate a serious attempt to compromise a user account within the organization's network.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the actor related to the alert by reviewing `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, or `okta.actor.display_name` fields in the alert.\n- Review the `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent` field to understand the device and software used by the actor.\n- Examine the `okta.outcome.reason` field for additional context around the bypass attempt.\n- Check the `okta.outcome.result` field to confirm the MFA bypass attempt.\n- Check if there are multiple unsuccessful MFA attempts from the same actor or IP address (`okta.client.ip`).\n- Check for successful logins immediately following the MFA bypass attempt.\n- Verify whether the actor's activity aligns with typical behavior or if any unusual activity took place around the time of the bypass attempt.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Check if there were issues with the MFA system at the time of the bypass attempt. This could indicate a system error rather than a genuine bypass attempt.\n- Check the geographical location (`okta.request.ip_chain.geographical_context`) and time of the login attempt. If these match the actor's normal behavior, it might be a false positive.\n- Verify the actor's MFA settings to ensure they are correctly configured.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- If unauthorized access is confirmed, initiate the incident response process.\n- Immediately lock the affected actor account and require a password change.\n- Consider resetting MFA tokens for the actor and require re-enrollment.\n- Check if the compromised account was used to access or alter any sensitive data or systems.\n- If a specific MFA bypass technique was used, ensure your systems are patched or configured to prevent such techniques.\n- Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n- Work with your IT team to minimize the impact on users and maintain business continuity.\n- If multiple accounts are affected, consider a broader reset or audit of MFA tokens.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/10/9-admin-best-practices-to-keep-your-org-secure/) by Okta.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Each preset comes with different default settings for Elastic Agent, you can further customize these later by configuring the Elastic Defend integration policy. [Helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html).\n- We suggest selecting \"Complete EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)\" as a configuration setting, that provides \"All events; all preventions\"\n- Enter a name for the agent policy in \"New agent policy name\". If other agent policies already exist, you can click the \"Existing hosts\" tab and select an existing policy instead.\nFor more details on Elastic Agent configuration settings, refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/8.10/agent-policy.html).\n- Click \"Save and Continue\".\n- To complete the integration, select \"Add Elastic Agent to your hosts\" and continue to the next section to install the Elastic Agent on your hosts.\nFor more details on Elastic Defend refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).\n",

Adversaries may attempt to launch a credential stuffing attack from the same device by using a list of known usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Note that Okta does not log unrecognized usernames supplied during authentication attempts, so this rule may not detect all credential stuffing attempts or may indicate a targeted attack.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Since this is an ES|QL rule, the `okta.actor.alternate_id` and `okta.client.ip` values can be used to pivot into the raw authentication events related to this activity.\n- Identify the users involved in this action by examining the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, and `okta.actor.display_name` fields.\n- Determine the device client used for these actions by analyzing `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.zone`, `okta.client.device`, and `okta.client.id` fields.\n- Review the `okta.security_context.is_proxy` field to determine if the device is a proxy.\n    - If the device is a proxy, this may indicate that a user is using a proxy to access multiple accounts for password spraying.\n- With the list of `okta.actor.alternate_id` values, review `event.outcome` results to determine if the authentication was successful.\n    - If the authentication was successful for any user, pivoting to `event.action` values for those users may provide additional context.\n- With Okta end users identified, review the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field.\n    - Historical analysis should indicate if this device token hash is commonly associated with the user.\n- Review the `okta.event_type` field to determine the type of authentication event that occurred.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.sso`, the user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.password`, the user may be using a proxy to access multiple accounts for password spraying.\n    - If the event type is `user.session.start`, the source may have attempted to establish a session via the Okta authentication API.\n- Examine the `okta.outcome.result` field to determine if the authentication was successful.\n- Review the past activities of the actor(s) involved in this action by checking their previous actions.\n- Evaluate the actions that happened just before and after this event in the `okta.event_type` field to help understand the full context of the activity.\n    - This may help determine the authentication and authorization actions that occurred between the user, Okta and application.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- A user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n- Users may share an endpoint related to work or personal use in which separate Okta accounts are used.\n    - Architecturally, this shared endpoint may leverage a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n    - Shared systems such as Kiosks and conference room computers may be used by multiple users.\n    - Shared working spaces may have a single endpoint that is used by multiple users.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- Review the profile of the users involved in this action to determine if proxy usage may be expected.\n- If the user is legitimate and the authentication behavior is not suspicious based on device analysis, no action is required.\n- If the user is legitimate but the authentication behavior is suspicious, consider resetting passwords for the users involves and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n    - If MFA is already enabled, consider resetting MFA for the users.\n- If any of the users are not legitimate, consider deactivating the user's account.\n- Conduct a review of Okta policies and ensure they are in accordance with security best practices.\n- Check with internal IT teams to determine if the accounts involved recently had MFA reset at the request of the user.\n    - If so, confirm with the user this was a legitimate request.\n    - If so and this was not a legitimate request, consider deactivating the user's account temporarily.\n        - Reset passwords and reset MFA for the user.\n- If this is a false positive, consider adding the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field to the `exceptions` list in the rule.\n    - This will prevent future occurrences of this event for this device from triggering the rule.\n    - Alternatively adding `okta.client.ip` or a CIDR range to the `exceptions` list can prevent future occurrences of this event from triggering the rule.\n        - This should be done with caution as it may prevent legitimate alerts from being generated.\n",

Adversaries may attempt to launch a credential stuffing attack from the same device by using a list of known usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Note that Okta does not log unrecognized usernames supplied during authentication attempts, so this rule may not detect all credential stuffing attempts or may indicate a targeted attack.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\nSince this is an ES|QL rule, the `okta.actor.alternate_id` and `okta.client.ip` values can be used to pivot into the raw authentication events related to this activity.\n- Identify the users involved in this action by examining the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, and `okta.actor.display_name` fields.\n- Determine the device client used for these actions by analyzing `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.zone`, `okta.client.device`, and `okta.client.id` fields.\n- Review the `okta.security_context.is_proxy` field to determine if the device is a proxy.\n    - If the device is a proxy, this may indicate that a user is using a proxy to access multiple accounts for password spraying.\n- With the list of `okta.actor.alternate_id` values, review `event.outcome` results to determine if the authentication was successful.\n    - If the authentication was successful for any user, pivoting to `event.action` values for those users may provide additional context.\n- With Okta end users identified, review the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field.\n    - Historical analysis should indicate if this device token hash is commonly associated with the user.\n- Review the `okta.event_type` field to determine the type of authentication event that occurred.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.sso`, the user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.password`, the user may be using a proxy to access multiple accounts for password spraying.\n    - If the event type is `user.session.start`, the source may have attempted to establish a session via the Okta authentication API.\n- Examine the `okta.outcome.result` field to determine if the authentication was successful.\n- Review the past activities of the actor(s) involved in this action by checking their previous actions.\n- Evaluate the actions that happened just before and after this event in the `okta.event_type` field to help understand the full context of the activity.\n    - This may help determine the authentication and authorization actions that occurred between the user, Okta and application.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- A user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n- Users may share an endpoint related to work or personal use in which separate Okta accounts are used.\n    - Architecturally, this shared endpoint may leverage a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n    - Shared systems such as Kiosks and conference room computers may be used by multiple users.\n    - Shared working spaces may have a single endpoint that is used by multiple users.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- Review the profile of the users involved in this action to determine if proxy usage may be expected.\n- If the user is legitimate and the authentication behavior is not suspicious based on device analysis, no action is required.\n- If the user is legitimate but the authentication behavior is suspicious, consider resetting passwords for the users involves and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n    - If MFA is already enabled, consider resetting MFA for the users.\n- If any of the users are not legitimate, consider deactivating the user's account.\n- Conduct a review of Okta policies and ensure they are in accordance with security best practices.\n- Check with internal IT teams to determine if the accounts involved recently had MFA reset at the request of the user.\n    - If so, confirm with the user this was a legitimate request.\n    - If so and this was not a legitimate request, consider deactivating the user's account temporarily.\n        - Reset passwords and reset MFA for the user.\n- If this is a false positive, consider adding the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field to the `exceptions` list in the rule.\n    - This will prevent future occurrences of this event for this device from triggering the rule.\n    - Alternatively adding `okta.client.ip` or a CIDR range to the `exceptions` list can prevent future occurrences of this event from triggering the rule.\n        - This should be done with caution as it may prevent legitimate alerts from being generated.\n",

However, some adversaries may abuse the system by repeatedly sending MFA push notifications until the user unwittingly approves the access.\n\nThis rule detects when a user denies MFA Okta Verify push notifications twice, followed by a successful authentication event within a 10-minute window. This sequence could indicate an adversary's attempt to bypass the Okta MFA policy.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Identify the user who received the MFA notifications by reviewing the `user.email` field.\n- Identify the time, source IP, and geographical location of the MFA requests and the subsequent successful login.\n- Review the `event.action` field to understand the nature of the events. It should include two `user.mfa.okta_verify.deny_push` actions and one `user.authentication.sso` action.\n- Ask the user if they remember receiving the MFA notifications and subsequently logging into their account.\n- Check if the MFA requests and the successful login occurred during the user's regular activity hours.\n- Look for any other suspicious activity on the account around the same time.\n- Identify whether the same pattern is repeated for other users in your organization. Multiple users receiving push notifications simultaneously might indicate a larger attack.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n\n- Determine if the MFA push notifications were legitimate. Sometimes, users accidentally trigger MFA requests or deny them unintentionally and later approve them.\n- Check if there are known issues with the MFA system causing false denials.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If unauthorized access is confirmed, initiate your incident response process.\n- Alert the user and your IT department immediately.\n- If possible, isolate the user's account until the issue is resolved.\n- Investigate the source of the unauthorized access.\n- If the account was accessed by an unauthorized party, determine the actions they took after logging in.\n- Consider enhancing your MFA policy to prevent such incidents in the future.\n- Encourage users to report any unexpected MFA notifications immediately.\n- Review and update your incident response plans and security policies based on the findings from the incident.\n",

Review the `okta.client.device`, `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.ip_chain.ip`, and `okta.client.geographical_context` fields.\n- Verify if the API token revocation was authorized or part of some planned activity.\n- Check the `okta.outcome.result` and `okta.outcome.reason` fields to see if the attempt was successful or failed.\n- Analyze the past activities of the actor involved in this action. An actor who usually performs such activities may indicate a legitimate reason.\n- Evaluate the actions that happened just before and after this event. It can help understand the full context of the activity.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- It might be a false positive if the action was part of a planned activity or was performed by an authorized person.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- If unauthorized revocation attempts are confirmed, initiate the incident response process.\n- Block the IP address or device used in the attempts, if they appear suspicious.\n- Reset the user's password and enforce MFA re-enrollment, if applicable.\n- Conduct a review of Okta policies and ensure they are in accordance with security best practices.\n- If the revoked token was used for critical integrations, coordinate with the relevant team to minimize the impact.",

Policies such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) are critical for enforcing strong security measures. Deactivation of an Okta policy could potentially weaken the security posture, allowing for unauthorized access or facilitating other malicious activities.\n\nThis rule is designed to detect attempts to deactivate an Okta policy, which could be indicative of an adversary's attempt to weaken an organization's security controls. For example, disabling an MFA policy could lower the security of user authentication processes.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Identify the actor related to the alert by reviewing `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, or `okta.actor.display_name` fields in the alert.\n- Review the `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent` field to understand the device and software used by the actor.\n- Examine the `okta.outcome.reason` field for additional context around the deactivation attempt.\n- Check the `okta.outcome.result` field to confirm the policy deactivation attempt.\n- Check if there are multiple policy deactivation attempts from the same actor or IP address (`okta.client.ip`).\n- Check for successful logins immediately following the policy deactivation attempt.\n- Verify whether the actor's activity aligns with typical behavior or if any unusual activity took place around the time of the deactivation attempt.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n\n- Check if there were issues with the Okta system at the time of the deactivation attempt. This could indicate a system error rather than a genuine threat activity.\n- Check the geographical location (`okta.request.ip_chain.geographical_context`) and time of the deactivation attempt. If these match the actor's normal behavior, it might be a false positive.\n- Verify the actor's administrative rights to ensure they are correctly configured.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If unauthorized policy deactivation is confirmed, initiate the incident response process.\n- Immediately lock the affected actor account and require a password change.\n- Consider resetting MFA tokens for the actor and require re-enrollment.\n- Check if the compromised account was used to access or alter any sensitive data or systems.\n- If a specific deactivation technique was used, ensure your systems are patched or configured to prevent such techniques.\n- Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n- Work with your IT team to minimize the impact on users and maintain business continuity.\n- If multiple accounts are affected, consider a broader reset or audit of MFA tokens.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/10/9-admin-best-practices-to-keep-your-org-secure/) by Okta.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Note that Okta does not log unrecognized usernames supplied during authentication attempts, so this rule may not detect all credential stuffing attempts or may indicate a targeted attack.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Since this is an ES|QL rule, the `okta.actor.alternate_id` and `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` values can be used to pivot into the raw authentication events related to this activity.\n- Identify the users involved in this action by examining the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, and `okta.actor.display_name` fields.\n- Determine the device client used for these actions by analyzing `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.zone`, `okta.client.device`, and `okta.client.id` fields.\n- Review the `okta.security_context.is_proxy` field to determine if the device is a proxy.\n    - If the device is a proxy, this may indicate that a user is using a proxy to access multiple accounts for password spraying.\n- With the list of `okta.actor.alternate_id` values, review `event.outcome` results to determine if the authentication was successful.\n    - If the authentication was successful for any user, pivoting to `event.action` values for those users may provide additional context.\n- With Okta end users identified, review the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field.\n    - Historical analysis should indicate if this device token hash is commonly associated with the user.\n- Review the `okta.event_type` field to determine the type of authentication event that occurred.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.sso`, the user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.password`, the user may be using a proxy to access multiple accounts for password spraying.\n- Examine the `okta.outcome.result` field to determine if the authentication was successful.\n- Review the past activities of the actor(s) involved in this action by checking their previous actions.\n- Evaluate the actions that happened just before and after this event in the `okta.event_type` field to help understand the full context of the activity.\n    - This may help determine the authentication and authorization actions that occurred between the user, Okta and application.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- A user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n- Users may share an endpoint related to work or personal use in which separate Okta accounts are used.\n    - Architecturally, this shared endpoint may leverage a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n    - Shared systems such as Kiosks and conference room computers may be used by multiple users.\n    - Shared working spaces may have a single endpoint that is used by multiple users.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- Review the profile of the users involved in this action to determine if proxy usage may be expected.\n- If the user is legitimate and the authentication behavior is not suspicious based on device analysis, no action is required.\n- If the user is legitimate but the authentication behavior is suspicious, consider resetting passwords for the users involves and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n    - If MFA is already enabled, consider resetting MFA for the users.\n- If any of the users are not legitimate, consider deactivating the user's account.\n- Conduct a review of Okta policies and ensure they are in accordance with security best practices.\n- Check with internal IT teams to determine if the accounts involved recently had MFA reset at the request of the user.\n    - If so, confirm with the user this was a legitimate request.\n    - If so and this was not a legitimate request, consider deactivating the user's account temporarily.\n        - Reset passwords and reset MFA for the user.\n- If this is a false positive, consider adding the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field to the `exceptions` list in the rule.\n    - This will prevent future occurrences of this event for this device from triggering the rule.\n",

This could indicate a system error rather than a genuine threat activity.\n- Check the geographical location (`okta.request.ip_chain.geographical_context`) and time of the modification attempt. If these match the actor's normal behavior, it might be a false positive.\n- Verify the actor's administrative rights to ensure they are correctly configured.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If unauthorized modification is confirmed, initiate the incident response process.\n- Immediately lock the affected actor account and require a password change.\n- Consider resetting MFA tokens for the actor and require re-enrollment.\n- Check if the compromised account was used to access or alter any sensitive data or systems.\n- If a specific modification technique was used, ensure your systems are patched or configured to prevent such techniques.\n- Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n- Work with your IT team to minimize the impact on users and maintain business continuity.\n- If multiple accounts are affected, consider a broader reset or audit of MFA tokens.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/10/9-admin-best-practices-to-keep-your-org-secure/) by Okta.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This rule detects attempts to modify, delete, or deactivate an Okta network zone, which may suggest an attempt to remove or weaken an organization's security controls.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Identify the actor related to the alert by reviewing `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, or `okta.actor.display_name` fields in the alert.\n- Review the `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent` field to understand the device and software used by the actor.\n- Examine the `okta.outcome.reason` field for additional context around the modification attempt.\n- Check the `okta.outcome.result` field to confirm the network zone modification attempt.\n- Check if there are multiple network zone modification attempts from the same actor or IP address (`okta.client.ip`).\n- Check for successful logins immediately following the modification attempt.\n- Verify whether the actor's activity aligns with typical behavior or if any unusual activity took place around the time of the modification attempt.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n\n- Check if there were issues with the Okta system at the time of the modification attempt. This could indicate a system error rather than a genuine threat activity.\n- Check the geographical location (`okta.request.ip_chain.geographical_context`) and time of the modification attempt. If these match the actor's normal behavior, it might be a false positive.\n- Verify the actor's administrative rights to ensure they are correctly configured.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If unauthorized modification is confirmed, initiate the incident response process.\n- Immediately lock the affected actor account and require a password change.\n- Consider resetting MFA tokens for the actor and require re-enrollment.\n- Check if the compromised account was used to access or alter any sensitive data or systems.\n- If a specific modification technique was used, ensure your systems are patched or configured to prevent such techniques.\n- Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n- Work with your IT team to minimize the impact on users and maintain business continuity.\n- If multiple accounts are affected, consider a broader reset or audit of MFA tokens.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/10/9-admin-best-practices-to-keep-your-org-secure/) by Okta.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

Excessive password resets or account unlocks can be indicative of an attacker's attempt to gain unauthorized access to an account.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Identify the actor associated with the excessive attempts. The `okta.actor.alternate_id` field can be used for this purpose.\n- Determine the client used by the actor. You can look at `okta.client.device`, `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.ip_chain.ip`, and `okta.client.geographical_context`.\n- Review the `okta.outcome.result` and `okta.outcome.reason` fields to understand the outcome of the password reset or unlock attempts.\n- Review the event actions associated with these attempts. Look at the `event.action` field and filter for actions related to password reset and account unlock attempts.\n- Check for other similar patterns of behavior from the same actor or IP address. If there is a high number of failed login attempts before the password reset or unlock attempts, this may suggest a brute force attack.\n- Also, look at the times when these attempts were made. If these were made during off-hours, it could further suggest an adversary's activity.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- This alert might be a false positive if there are legitimate reasons for a high number of password reset or unlock attempts. This could be due to the user forgetting their password or account lockouts due to too many incorrect attempts.\n- Check the actor's past behavior. If this is their usual behavior and they have a valid reason for it, then it might be a false positive.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- If unauthorized attempts are confirmed, initiate the incident response process.\n- Reset the user's password and enforce MFA re-enrollment, if applicable.\n- Block the IP address or device used in the attempts, if they appear suspicious.\n- If the attack was facilitated by a particular technique, ensure your systems are patched or configured to prevent such techniques.\n- Consider a security review of your Okta policies and rules to ensure they follow security best practices.",

Unauthorized deactivation could lead to disruption of services and pose a significant risk to the organization.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Identify the actor associated with the deactivation attempt by examining the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, and `okta.actor.display_name` fields.\n- Determine the client used by the actor. Review the `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.zone`, `okta.client.device`, and `okta.client.id` fields.\n- If the client is a device, check the `okta.device.id`, `okta.device.name`, `okta.device.os_platform`, `okta.device.os_version`, and `okta.device.managed` fields.\n- Understand the context of the event from the `okta.debug_context.debug_data` and `okta.authentication_context` fields.\n- Check the `okta.outcome.result` and `okta.outcome.reason` fields to see if the attempt was successful or failed.\n- Review the past activities of the actor involved in this action by checking their previous actions logged in the `okta.target` field.\n- Analyze the `okta.transaction.id` and `okta.transaction.type` fields to understand the context of the transaction.\n- Evaluate the actions that happened just before and after this event in the `okta.event_type` field to help understand the full context of the activity.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- It might be a false positive if the action was part of a planned activity, performed by an authorized person, or if the `okta.outcome.result` field shows a failure.\n- An unsuccessful attempt might also indicate an authorized user having trouble rather than a malicious activity.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- If unauthorized deactivation attempts are confirmed, initiate the incident response process.\n- Block the IP address or device used in the attempts if they appear suspicious, using the data from the `okta.client.ip` and `okta.device.id` fields.\n- Reset the user's password and enforce MFA re-enrollment, if applicable.\n- Conduct a review of Okta policies and ensure they are in accordance with security best practices.\n- If the deactivated application was crucial for business operations, coordinate with the relevant team to reactivate it and minimize the impact.",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Attempt to Deactivate an Okta Policy Rule\n\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) systems like Okta serve as the first line of defense for an organization's network, and are often targeted by adversaries. By disabling security rules, adversaries can circumvent multi-factor authentication, access controls, or other protective measures enforced by these policies, enabling unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.\n\nThis rule detects attempts to deactivate a rule within an Okta policy, which could be indicative of an adversary's attempt to weaken an organization's security controls. A threat actor may do this to remove barriers to their activities or enable future attacks.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Identify the actor related to the alert by reviewing `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, or `okta.actor.display_name` fields in the alert.\n- Review the `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent` field to understand the device and software used by the actor.\n- Examine the `okta.outcome.reason` field for additional context around the deactivation attempt.\n- Check the `okta.outcome.result` field to confirm the policy rule deactivation attempt.\n- Check if there are multiple policy rule deactivation attempts from the same actor or IP address (`okta.client.ip`).\n- Check for successful logins immediately following the policy rule deactivation attempt.\n- Verify whether the actor's activity aligns with typical behavior or if any unusual activity took place around the time of the deactivation attempt.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n\n- Check if there were issues with the Okta system at the time of the deactivation attempt. This could indicate a system error rather than a genuine threat activity.\n- Check the geographical location (`okta.request.ip_chain.geographical_context`) and time of the deactivation attempt. If these match the actor's normal behavior, it might be a false positive.\n- Verify the actor's administrative rights to ensure they are correctly configured.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If unauthorized policy rule deactivation is confirmed, initiate the incident response process.\n- Immediately lock the affected actor account and require a password change.\n- Consider resetting MFA tokens for the actor and require re-enrollment.\n- Check if the compromised account was used to access or alter any sensitive data or systems.\n- If a specific deactivation technique was used, ensure your systems are patched or configured to prevent such techniques.\n- Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n- Work with your IT team to minimize the impact on users and maintain business continuity.\n- If multiple accounts are affected, consider a broader reset or audit of MFA tokens.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/10/9-admin-best-practices-to-keep-your-org-secure/) by Okta.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

This type of activity typically indicates Okta administrative access and should only ever occur if requested and expected.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the actor associated with the impersonation event by checking the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, or `okta.actor.display_name` fields.\n- Review the `event.action` field to confirm the initiation of the impersonation event.\n- Check the `event.time` field to understand the timing of the event.\n- Check the `okta.target.id`, `okta.target.type`, `okta.target.alternate_id`, or `okta.target.display_name` to identify the user who was impersonated.\n- Review any activities that occurred during the impersonation session. Look for any activities related to the impersonated user's account during and after the impersonation event.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Verify if the session impersonation was part of an approved activity. Check if it was associated with any documented administrative tasks or troubleshooting efforts.\n- Ensure that the impersonation session was initiated by an authorized individual. You can check this by verifying the `okta.actor.id` or `okta.actor.display_name` against the list of approved administrators.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- If the impersonation was not authorized, consider it as a breach. Suspend the user account of the impersonator immediately.\n- Reset the user session and invalidate any active sessions related to the impersonated user.\n- If a specific impersonation technique was used, ensure that systems are patched or configured to prevent such techniques.\n- Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the extent of the breach and the potential impact on the systems and data.\n- Review and update your security policies to prevent such incidents in the future.\n- Implement additional monitoring and logging of Okta events to improve visibility of user actions.",

Deletion of a rule within an Okta policy could potentially weaken the organization's security posture, allowing for unauthorized access or facilitating other malicious activities.\n\nThis rule detects attempts to delete an Okta policy rule, which could indicate an adversary's attempt to weaken an organization's security controls. Adversaries may do this to circumvent security measures and enable further malicious activities.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Identify the actor related to the alert by reviewing `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, or `okta.actor.display_name` fields in the alert.\n- Review the `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent` field to understand the device and software used by the actor.\n- Examine the `okta.outcome.reason` field for additional context around the deletion attempt.\n- Check the `okta.outcome.result` field to confirm the policy rule deletion attempt.\n- Check if there are multiple policy rule deletion attempts from the same actor or IP address (`okta.client.ip`).\n- Check for successful logins immediately following the policy rule deletion attempt.\n- Verify whether the actor's activity aligns with typical behavior or if any unusual activity took place around the time of the deletion attempt.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n\n- Check if there were issues with the Okta system at the time of the deletion attempt. This could indicate a system error rather than a genuine threat activity.\n- Check the geographical location (`okta.request.ip_chain.geographical_context`) and time of the deletion attempt. If these match the actor's normal behavior, it might be a false positive.\n- Verify the actor's administrative rights to ensure they are correctly configured.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If unauthorized policy rule deletion is confirmed, initiate the incident response process.\n- Immediately lock the affected actor account and require a password change.\n- Consider resetting MFA tokens for the actor and require re-enrollment.\n- Check if the compromised account was used to access or alter any sensitive data or systems.\n- If a specific deletion technique was used, ensure your systems are patched or configured to prevent such techniques.\n- Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.\n- Work with your IT team to minimize the impact on users and maintain business continuity.\n- If multiple accounts are affected, consider a broader reset or audit of MFA tokens.\n- Implement security best practices [outlined](https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/10/9-admin-best-practices-to-keep-your-org-secure/) by Okta.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).",

In this context, Okta accounts are targeted.\n\nThis rule fires when an Okta user account has been locked out 3 times within a 3-hour window. This could indicate an attempted brute force or password spraying attack to gain unauthorized access to the user account. Okta's default authentication policy locks a user account after 10 failed authentication attempts.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Identify the actor related to the alert by reviewing `okta.actor.alternate_id` field in the alert. This should give the username of the account being targeted.\n- Review the `okta.event_type` field to understand the nature of the events that led to the account lockout.\n- Check the `okta.severity` and `okta.display_message` fields for more context around the lockout events.\n- Look for correlation of events from the same IP address. Multiple lockouts from the same IP address might indicate a single source for the attack.\n- If the IP is not familiar, investigate it. The IP could be a proxy, VPN, Tor node, cloud datacenter, or a legitimate IP turned malicious.\n- Determine if the lockout events occurred during the user's regular activity hours. Unusual timing may indicate malicious activity.\n- Examine the authentication methods used during the lockout events by checking the `okta.authentication_context.credential_type` field.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n\n- Determine whether the account owner or an internal user made repeated mistakes in entering their credentials, leading to the account lockout.\n- Ensure there are no known network or application issues that might cause these events.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- Alert the user and your IT department immediately.\n- If unauthorized access is confirmed, initiate your incident response process.\n- Investigate the source of the attack. If a specific machine or network is compromised, additional steps may need to be taken to address the issue.\n- Require the affected user to change their password.\n- If the attack is ongoing, consider blocking the IP address initiating the brute force attack.\n- Implement account lockout policies to limit the impact of brute force attacks.\n- Encourage users to use complex, unique passwords and consider implementing multi-factor authentication.\n- Check if the compromised account was used to access or alter any sensitive data or systems.",
