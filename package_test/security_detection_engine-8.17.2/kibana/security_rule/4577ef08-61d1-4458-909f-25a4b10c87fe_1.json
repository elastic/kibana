    "note": "## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS RDS DB Snapshot Shared with Another Account\n\nThis rule identifies when an RDS DB snapshot is shared with another AWS account. While sharing DB snapshots is a common practice, adversaries may exploit this feature to exfiltrate data by sharing snapshots with external accounts under their control.\n\n#### Possible Investigation Steps\n\n- **Identify the Actor**: Review the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` fields to identify who made the change. Verify if this actor typically performs such actions and if they have the necessary permissions.\n- **Review the Sharing Event**: Identify the DB snapshot involved and review the event details. Look for `ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute` or `ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute` actions where the snapshot attributes were changed to include additional user accounts.\n    - **Request and Response Parameters**: Check the `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` and `aws.cloudtrail.response_elements` fields in the CloudTrail event to identify the DB Snapshot Identifier and account ID with which the snapshot was shared.\n- **Verify the Shared Snapshot**: Check the DB snapshot that was shared and its contents to determine the sensitivity of the data stored within it.\n- **Validate External Account**: Examine the AWS account to which the snapshot was shared. Determine whether this account is known and previously authorized to access such resources.\n- **Contextualize with Recent Changes**: Compare this sharing event against recent changes in RDS DB or Cluster configurations and deployments. Look for any other recent permissions changes or unusual administrative actions.\n- **Correlate with Other Activities**: Search for related CloudTrail events before and after this change to see if the same actor or IP address engaged in other potentially suspicious activities.\n- **Interview Relevant Personnel**: If the share was initiated by a user, verify the intent and authorization for this action with the person or team responsible for managing DB backups and snapshots.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- **Legitimate Backup Actions**: Confirm if the Db snapshot sharing aligns with scheduled backups or legitimate automation tasks.\n- **Consistency Check**: Compare the action against historical data of similar actions performed by the user or within the organization. If the action is consistent with past legitimate activities, it might indicate a false alarm.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- **Immediate Review and Reversal**: If the change was unauthorized, update the snapshot permissions to remove any unauthorized accounts and restore it to its previous state.\n- **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts**: Adjust monitoring systems to alert on similar actions, especially those involving sensitive data or permissions.\n- **Audit Snapshots and Policies**: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all snapshots and associated policies to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.\n- **Policy Update**: Review and possibly update your organizationâ€™s policies on DB snapshot sharing to tighten control and prevent unauthorized access.\n- **Incident Response**: If malicious intent is confirmed, consider it a data breach incident and initiate the incident response protocol. This includes further investigation, containment, and recovery.\n\n### Additional Information:\n\nFor further guidance on managing DB backups and securing AWS environments, refer to the [AWS RDS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_CommonTasks.BackupRestore.html) and AWS best practices for security.
