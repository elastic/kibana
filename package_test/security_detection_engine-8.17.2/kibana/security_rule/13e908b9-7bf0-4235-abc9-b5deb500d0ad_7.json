Under Management, click Integrations.\n- In the query bar, search for Living off the Land Attack Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.\n- Follow the instructions under the **Installation** section.\n- For this rule to work, complete the instructions through **Configure the ingest pipeline**.\n",
