    "description": "A machine learning job has detected a rare process writing data to an external device. Malicious actors often use benign-looking processes to mask their data exfiltration activities. The discovery of such a process that has no legitimate reason to write data to external devices can indicate exfiltration.",

Anomalies are detected using Elastic's Anomaly Detection feature. \n\n#### Prerequisite Requirements:\n- Fleet is required for Data Exfiltration Detection.\n- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).\n- File events collected by the Elastic Defend integration.\n- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).\n\n#### The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the Data Exfiltration Detection integration:\n- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.\n- In the query bar, search for Data Exfiltration Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.\n- Follow the instructions under the **Installation** section.\n- For this rule to work, complete the instructions through **Add preconfigured anomaly detection jobs**.\n",
