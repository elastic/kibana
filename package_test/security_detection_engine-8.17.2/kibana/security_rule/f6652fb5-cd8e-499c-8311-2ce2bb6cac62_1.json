    "note": "## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS RDS DB Instance or Cluster Deletion Protection Disabled\n\nThis rule identifies when the deletion protection feature is removed from an RDS DB instance or cluster. Removing deletion protection is a prerequisite for deleting a DB instance. Adversaries may exploit this feature to permanently delete data in a compromised environment.\n\n#### Possible Investigation Steps\n\n- **Identify the Actor**: Review the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` fields to identify who made the change. Verify if this actor typically performs such actions and if they have the necessary permissions.\n- **Review the Modification Event**: Identify the DB instance involved and review the event details. Look for `ModifyDBInstance` actions where the deletionProtection parameter was changed.\n    - **Request and Response Parameters**: Check the `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` field in the CloudTrail event to identify the DB instance or cluster identifier and any other modifications made to the instance.\n- **Verify the Modified Instance**: Check the DB instance that was modified and its contents to determine the sensitivity of the data stored within it.\n- **Contextualize with Recent Changes**: Compare this modification event against recent changes in RDS DB instance or cluster configurations and deployments. Look for any other recent permissions changes or unusual administrative actions.\n- **Correlate with Other Activities**: Search for related CloudTrail events before and after this change to see if the same actor or IP address engaged in other potentially suspicious activities.\n- **Interview Relevant Personnel**: If the modification was initiated by a user, verify the intent and authorization for this action with the person or team responsible for managing DB instances.\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- **Legitimate Instance Modification**: Confirm if the DB instance modification aligns with legitimate tasks.\n- **Consistency Check**: Compare the action against historical data of similar actions performed by the user or within the organization. If the action is consistent with past legitimate activities, it might indicate a false alarm.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- **Immediate Review and Reversal**: If the change was unauthorized, reset deletionProtection to true.\n- **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts**: Adjust monitoring systems to alert on similar actions, especially those involving sensitive data or permissions.\n- **Audit Instances and Policies**: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all instances and associated policies to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.\n- **Policy Update**: Review and possibly update your organizationâ€™s policies on DB instance access to tighten control and prevent unauthorized access.\n- **Incident Response**: If malicious intent is confirmed, consider it a data breach incident and initiate the incident response protocol. This includes further investigation, containment, and recovery.\n\n### Additional Information:\n\nFor further guidance on managing DB instances and securing AWS environments, refer to the [AWS RDS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_RDS_Managing.html) and AWS best practices for security.
