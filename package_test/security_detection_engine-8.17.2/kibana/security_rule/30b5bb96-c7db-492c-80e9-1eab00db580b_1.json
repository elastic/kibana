This allows for easy recovery of deleted or overwritten objects. When object versioning is suspended for a bucket, it could indicate an adversary's attempt to inhibit system recovery following malicious activity. Additionally, when versioning is suspended, buckets can then be deleted.",

    "note": "\n## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS S3 Object Versioning Suspended\n\nThis rule detects when object versioning for an S3 bucket is suspended. Adversaries with access to a misconfigured S3 bucket may disable object versioning prior to replacing or deleting S3 objects, inhibiting recovery initiatives.\nThis rule uses [EQL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/rules-ui-create.html#create-eql-rule) to look for use of the `PutBucketVersioning` operation where the `request_parameters` include `Status=Suspended`.\n\n#### Possible Investigation Steps:\n\n- **Identify the Actor**: Review the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` fields to identify who performed the action. Verify if this actor typically performs such actions and if they have the necessary permissions.\n- **Analyze the Source of the Request**: Investigate the `source.ip` and `source.geo` fields to determine the geographical origin of the request. An external or unexpected location might indicate compromised credentials or unauthorized access.\n- **Correlate with Other Activities**: Search for related CloudTrail events before and after this action to see if the same actor or IP address engaged in other potentially suspicious activities.\n- **Check for Object Deletion or Access**: Look for `DeleteObject`, `DeleteObjects`, or `GetObject` API calls to the same S3 bucket that may indicate the adversary accessing and destroying objects including older object versions.\n- **Interview Relevant Personnel**: If the copy event was initiated by a user, verify the intent and authorization for this action with the person or team responsible for managing S3 buckets.\n\n### False Positive Analysis:\n\n- **Legitimate Administrative Actions**: Confirm if the action aligns with legitimate administrative tasks documented in change management systems.\n- **Consistency Check**: Compare the action against historical data of similar activities performed by the user or within the organization. If the action is consistent with past legitimate activities, it might indicate a false alarm.\n\n### Response and Remediation:\n\n- **Immediate Review**: If the activity was unauthorized, search for replaced or deleted objects and review the bucket's access logs for any suspicious activity.\n- **Educate and Train**: Provide additional training to users with administrative rights on the importance of security best practices concerning S3 bucket management and the risks of ransomware.\n- **Audit S3 Bucket Policies and Permissions**: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all S3 bucket policies and associated permissions to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.\n- **Incident Response**: If there's an indication of malicious intent or a security breach, initiate the incident response protocol to mitigate any damage and prevent future occurrences.\n\n### Additional Information:\n\nFor further guidance on managing S3 bucket security and protecting against ransomware, refer to the [AWS S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) and AWS best practices for security.
