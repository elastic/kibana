    "note": "\n## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating EC2 AMI Shared with Another Account\n\nThis rule identifies when an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is shared with another AWS account. While sharing AMIs is a common practice, adversaries may exploit this feature to exfiltrate data by sharing AMIs with external accounts under their control.\n\n#### Possible Investigation Steps\n\n- **Review the Sharing Event**: Identify the AMI involved and review the event details in AWS CloudTrail. Look for `ModifyImageAttribute` actions where the AMI attributes were changed to include additional user accounts.\n    - **Request and Response Parameters**: Check the `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` and `aws.response.response_elements` fields in the CloudTrail event to identify the AMI ID and the user ID of the account with which the AMI was shared.\n- **Verify the Shared AMI**: Check the AMI that was shared and its contents to determine the sensitivity of the data stored within it.\n- **Contextualize with Recent Changes**: Compare this sharing event against recent changes in AMI configurations and deployments. Look for any other recent permissions changes or unusual administrative actions.\n- **Validate External Account**: Examine the AWS account to which the AMI was shared. Determine whether this account is known and previously authorized to access such resources.\n- **Interview Relevant Personnel**: If the share was initiated by a user, verify the intent and authorization for this action with the person or team responsible for managing AMI deployments.\n- **Audit Related Security Policies**: Check the security policies governing AMI sharing within your organization to ensure they are being followed and are adequate to prevent unauthorized sharing.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- **Legitimate Sharing Practices**: AMI sharing is a common and legitimate practice for collaboration and resource management in AWS. Always verify that the sharing activity was unauthorized before escalating.\n- **Automation Tools**: Some organizations use automation tools for AMI management which might programmatically share AMIs. Verify if such tools are in operation and whether their actions are responsible for the observed behavior.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- **Review and Revoke Unauthorized Shares**: If the share is found to be unauthorized, immediately revoke the shared permissions from the AMI.\n- **Enhance Monitoring of Shared AMIs**: Implement monitoring to track changes to shared AMIs and alert on unauthorized access patterns.\n- **Incident Response**: If malicious intent is confirmed, consider it a data breach incident and initiate the incident response protocol. This includes further investigation, containment, and recovery.\n- **Policy Update**: Review and possibly update your organizationâ€™s policies on AMI sharing to tighten control and prevent unauthorized access.\n- **Educate Users**: Conduct training sessions for users involved in managing AMIs to reinforce best practices and organizational policies regarding AMI sharing.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nFor more information on managing and sharing AMIs, refer to the [Amazon EC2 User Guide on AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) and [Sharing AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/sharingamis-explicit.html).
