    "note": "## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS IAM CompromisedKeyQuarantine Policy Attached to User\n\nThe AWS IAM `CompromisedKeyQuarantine` and `CompromisedKeyQuarantineV2` managed policies deny certain action and is applied by the AWS team to a user with exposed credentials. \nThis action is accompanied by a support case which specifies instructions to follow before detaching the policy. \n\n#### Possible Investigation Steps\n\n- **Identify Potentially Compromised Identity**: Review the `userName` parameter of the `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` to determine the quarantined IAM entity.\n- **Contextualize with AWS Support Case**: Review any information from AWS comtaining additional information about the quarantined account and the reasoning for quarantine.\n- **Follow Support Case Instructions**: Do not revert the quarantine policy attachment or delete the compromised keys. Instead folow the instructions given in your support case.\n- **Correlate with Other Activities**: Search for related CloudTrail events before and after this change to see if the same actor or IP address engaged in potentially suspicious activities.\n- **Interview Relevant Personnel**: If the compromised key belongs to a user, verify the intent and authorization for these correlated actions with the person or team responsible for managing the compromised key.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- There shouldn't be many false positives related to this action as it is inititated by AWS in response to compromised or publicly exposed credentials.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- **Immediate Review and Reversal**: Update the user IAM permissions to remove the quarantine policy and disable the compromised credentials.\n- **Policy Update**: Review and possibly update your organizationâ€™s policies on credential storage to tighten control and prevent public exposure.\n- **Incident Response**: If malicious intent is confirmed, consider it a data breach incident and initiate the incident response protocol. This includes further investigation, containment, and recovery.\n\n### Additional Information:\n\nFor further guidance on managing and securing credentials in AWS environments, refer to the [AWS IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) regarding security best practices and guidance on [Remediating Potentially Compromised AWS Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/compromised-creds.html).\n",
