    "setup": "## Setup\n\nThe rule requires the Lateral Movement Detection integration assets to be installed, as well as file and Windows RDP process events collected by the Elastic Defend integration.  \n\n### Lateral Movement Detection Setup\nThe Lateral Movement Detection integration detects lateral movement activity by identifying abnormalities in file and Windows RDP events. Anomalies are detected using Elastic's Anomaly Detection feature.\n\n#### Prerequisite Requirements:\n- Fleet is required for Lateral Movement Detection.\n- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).\n- Windows RDP process events collected by the [Elastic Defend](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint) integration.\n- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).\n\n#### The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the Lateral Movement Detection integration:\n- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.\n- In the query bar, search for Lateral Movement Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.\n- Under Settings, click Install Lateral Movement Detection assets and follow the prompts to install the assets.\n\n#### Anomaly Detection Setup\nBefore you can enable rules for Lateral Movement Detection, you'll need to enable the corresponding Anomaly Detection jobs.\n- Before enabling the Anomaly Detection jobs, confirm that the Pivot Transform asset is installed and actively gathering data in the destination index `ml-rdp-lmd`.\n- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Analytics, click Machine Learning.\n- Under Anomaly Detection, click Jobs, and then click \"Create job\". Select the Data View containing your transformed RDP process data i.e.`ml-rdp-lmd`.\n- If the selected Data View contains events that match the query in [this](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/main/packages/lmd/kibana/ml_module/lmd-ml.json) configuration file, you will see a card for Lateral Movement Detection under \"Use preconfigured jobs\".\n- Keep the default settings and click \"Create jobs\" to start the anomaly detection jobs and datafeeds.\n",
