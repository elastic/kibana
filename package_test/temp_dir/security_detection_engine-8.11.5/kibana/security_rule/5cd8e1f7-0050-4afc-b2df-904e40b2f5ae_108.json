This allows them to keep operating after the security team discovers abused accounts.\n\nThis rule monitors events related to a user being added to a privileged group.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should manage members of this group.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- This attack abuses a legitimate Active Directory mechanism, so it is important to determine whether the activity is legitimate, if the administrator is authorized to perform this operation, and if there is a need to grant the account this level of privilege.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- If the admin is not aware of the operation, activate your Active Directory incident response plan.\n- If the user does not need the administrator privileges, remove the account from the privileged group.\n- Review the privileges of the administrator account that performed the action.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\n",
