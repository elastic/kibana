        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Multiple Okta User Auth Events with Same Device Token Hash Behind a Proxy\n\nThis rule detects when Okta user authentication events are reported for multiple users with the same device token hash behind a proxy. This may indicate that a shared device between users, or that a user is using a proxy to access multiple accounts for password spraying.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Identify the users involved in this action by examining the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, and `okta.actor.display_name` fields.\n- Determine the device client used for these actions by analyzing `okta.client.ip`, `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent`, `okta.client.zone`, `okta.client.device`, and `okta.client.id` fields.\n    - Since the device is behind a proxy, the `okta.client.ip` field will not be useful for determining the actual device IP address.\n- Review the `okta.request.ip_chain` field for more information about the geographic location of the proxy.\n- With Okta end users identified, review the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field.\n    - Historical analysis should indicate if this device token hash is commonly associated with the user.\n- Review the `okta.event_type` field to determine the type of authentication event that occurred.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.sso`, the user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n    - If the event type is `user.authentication.password`, the user may be using a proxy to access multiple accounts for password spraying.\n- Examine the `okta.outcome.result` field to determine if the authentication was successful.\n- Review the past activities of the actor(s) involved in this action by checking their previous actions.\n- Evaluate the actions that happened just before and after this event in the `okta.event_type` field to help understand the full context of the activity.\n    - This may help determine the authentication and authorization actions that occurred between the user, Okta and application.\n\n### False positive analysis:\n- A user may have legitimately started a session via a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n- Users may share an endpoint related to work or personal use in which separate Okta accounts are used.\n    - Architecturally, this shared endpoint may leverage a proxy for security or privacy reasons.\n    - Shared systems such as Kiosks and conference room computers may be used by multiple users.\n    - Shared working spaces may have a single endpoint that is used by multiple users.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n- Review the profile of the users involved in this action to determine if proxy usage may be expected.\n- If the user is legitimate and the authentication behavior is not suspicious based on device analysis, no action is required.\n- If the user is legitimate but the authentication behavior is suspicious, consider resetting passwords for the users involves and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n    - If MFA is already enabled, consider resetting MFA for the users.\n- If any of the users are not legitimate, consider deactivating the user's account.\n- Conduct a review of Okta policies and ensure they are in accordance with security best practices.\n- Check with internal IT teams to determine if the accounts involved recently had MFA reset at the request of the user.\n    - If so, confirm with the user this was a legitimate request.\n    - If so and this was not a legitimate request, consider deactivating the user's account temporarily.\n        - Reset passwords and reset MFA for the user.\n- If this is a false positive, consider adding the `okta.debug_context.debug_data.dt_hash` field to the `exceptions` list in the rule.\n    - This will prevent future occurrences of this event for this device from triggering the rule.\n",
