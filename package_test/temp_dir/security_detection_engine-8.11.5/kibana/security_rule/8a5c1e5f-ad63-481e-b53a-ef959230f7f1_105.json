Deactivating a network zone in Okta may remove or weaken the security controls of an organization, which might be an indicator of an adversary's attempt to evade defenses.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the actor related to the alert by reviewing the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, or `okta.actor.display_name` fields.\n- Examine the `event.action` field to confirm the deactivation of a network zone.\n- Check the `okta.target.id`, `okta.target.type`, `okta.target.alternate_id`, or `okta.target.display_name` to identify the network zone that was deactivated.\n- Investigate the `event.time` field to understand when the event happened.\n- Review the actor's activities before and after the event to understand the context of this event.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Check the `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent` field to understand the device and software used by the actor. If these match the actor's normal behavior, it might be a false positive.\n- Check if the actor is a known administrator or part of the IT team who might have a legitimate reason to deactivate a network zone.\n- Verify the actor's actions with any known planned changes or maintenance activities.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- If unauthorized access or actions are confirmed, immediately lock the affected actor account and require a password change.\n- Re-enable the deactivated network zone if it was deactivated without authorization.\n- Review and update the privileges of the actor who initiated the deactivation.\n- Check the security policies and procedures to identify any gaps and update them as necessary.\n- Implement additional monitoring and logging of Okta events to improve visibility of user actions.\n- Communicate and train the employees about the importance of following proper procedures for modifying network zone settings.",
