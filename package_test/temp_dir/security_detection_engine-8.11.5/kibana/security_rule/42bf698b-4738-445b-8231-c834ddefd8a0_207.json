        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Okta Brute Force or Password Spraying Attack\n\nThis rule alerts when a high number of failed Okta user authentication attempts occur from a single IP address. This could be indicative of a brute force or password spraying attack, where an adversary may attempt to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by guessing the passwords.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Review the `source.ip` field to identify the IP address from which the high volume of failed login attempts originated.\n- Look into the `event.outcome` field to verify that these are indeed failed authentication attempts.\n- Determine the `user.name` or `user.email` related to these failed login attempts. If the attempts are spread across multiple accounts, it might indicate a password spraying attack.\n- Check the timeline of the events. Are the failed attempts spread out evenly, or are there burst periods, which might indicate an automated tool?\n- Determine the geographical location of the source IP. Is this location consistent with the user's typical login location?\n- Analyze any previous successful logins from this IP. Was this IP previously associated with successful logins?\n\n### False positive analysis:\n\n- A single user or automated process that attempts to authenticate using expired or wrong credentials multiple times may trigger a false positive.\n- Analyze the behavior of the source IP. If the IP is associated with legitimate users or services, it may be a false positive.\n\n### Response and remediation:\n\n- If you identify unauthorized access attempts, consider blocking the source IP at the firewall level.\n- Notify the users who are targeted by the attack. Ask them to change their passwords and ensure they use unique, complex passwords.\n- Enhance monitoring on the affected user accounts for any suspicious activity.\n- If the attack is persistent, consider implementing CAPTCHA or account lockouts after a certain number of failed login attempts.\n- If the attack is persistent, consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the affected user accounts.\n- Review and update your security policies based on the findings from the incident.",
