The `ngApp` directive\n * designates the **root element** of the application and is typically placed near the root element\n * of the page - e.g. on the `<body>` or `<html>` tags.\n *\n * Only one AngularJS application can be auto-bootstrapped per HTML document. The first `ngApp`\n * found in the document will be used to define the root element to auto-bootstrap as an\n * application. To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using\n * {@link angular.bootstrap} instead. AngularJS applications cannot be nested within each other.\n *\n * You can specify an **AngularJS module** to be used as the root module for the application.  This\n * module will be loaded into the {@link auto.$injector} when the application is bootstrapped and\n * should contain the application code needed or have dependencies on other modules that will\n * contain the code. See {@link angular.module} for more information.\n *\n * In the example below if the `ngApp` directive were not placed on the `html` element then the\n * document would not be compiled, the `AppController` would not be instantiated and the `{{ a+b }}`\n * would not be resolved to `3`.\n *\n * `ngApp` is the easiest, and most common, way to bootstrap an application.\n *\n <example module=\"ngAppDemo\">\n   <file name=\"index.html\">\n   <div ng-controller=\"ngAppDemoController\">\n     I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}\n   </div>\n   </file>\n   <file name=\"script.js\">\n   angular.module('ngAppDemo', []).controller('ngAppDemoController', function($scope) {\n     $scope.a = 1;\n     $scope.b = 2;\n   });\n   </file>\n </example>\n *\n */\nfunction angularInit(element, bootstrap) {\n  var elements = [element],\n      appElement,\n      module,\n      names = ['ng:app', 'ng-app', 'x-ng-app', 'data-ng-app'],\n      NG_APP_CLASS_REGEXP = /\\sng[:\\-]app(:\\s*([\\w\\d_]+);?)?\\s/;\n\n  function append(element) {\n    element && elements.push(element);\n  }\n\n  forEach(names, function(name) {\n    names[name] = true;\n    append(document.getElementById(name));\n    name = name.replace(':', '\\\\:');\n    if (element.querySelectorAll) {\n      forEach(element.querySelectorAll('.' + name), append);\n      forEach(element.querySelectorAll('.' + name + '\\\\:'), append);\n      forEach(element.querySelectorAll('[' + name + ']'), append);\n    }\n  });\n\n  forEach(elements, function(element) {\n    if (!appElement) {\n      var className = ' ' + element.className + ' ';\n      var match = NG_APP_CLASS_REGEXP.exec(className);\n      if (match) {\n        appElement = element;\n        module = (match[2] || '').replace(/\\s+/g, ',');\n      } else {\n        forEach(element.attributes, function(attr) {\n          if (!appElement && names[attr.name]) {\n            appElement = element;\n            module = attr.value;\n          }\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  });\n  if (appElement) {\n    bootstrap(appElement, module ?

This can be used to clean up any 3rd party bindings to the DOM\n *    element before it is removed.\n *\n * ### Methods\n * - `controller(name)` - retrieves the controller of the current element or its parent. By default\n *   retrieves controller associated with the `ngController` directive. If `name` is provided as\n *   camelCase directive name, then the controller for this directive will be retrieved (e.g.\n *   `'ngModel'`).\n * - `injector()` - retrieves the injector of the current element or its parent.\n * - `scope()` - retrieves the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} of the current\n *   element or its parent.\n * - `isolateScope()` - retrieves an isolate {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} if one is attached directly to the\n *   current element. This getter should be used only on elements that contain a directive which starts a new isolate\n *   scope. Calling `scope()` on this element always returns the original non-isolate scope.\n * - `inheritedData()` - same as `data()`, but walks up the DOM until a value is found or the top\n *   parent element is reached.\n *\n * @param {string|DOMElement} element HTML string or DOMElement to be wrapped into jQuery.\n * @returns {Object} jQuery object.\n */\n\nJQLite.expando = 'ng339';\n\nvar jqCache = JQLite.cache = {},\n    jqId = 1,\n    addEventListenerFn = (window.document.addEventListener\n      ? function(element, type, fn) {element.addEventListener(type, fn, false);}\n      : function(element, type, fn) {element.attachEvent('on' + type, fn);}),\n    removeEventListenerFn = (window.document.removeEventListener\n      ? function(element, type, fn) {element.removeEventListener(type, fn, false); }\n      : function(element, type, fn) {element.detachEvent('on' + type, fn); });\n\n/*\n * !!!

In these situations using the array notation to specify the dependencies in\n * a way that survives minification is a better choice:\n *\n * ```js\n *   // We wish to write this (not minification / obfuscation safe)\n *   injector.invoke(function($compile, $rootScope) {\n *     // ...\n *   });\n *\n *   // We are forced to write break inlining\n *   var tmpFn = function(obfuscatedCompile, obfuscatedRootScope) {\n *     // ...\n *   };\n *   tmpFn.$inject = ['$compile', '$rootScope'];\n *   injector.invoke(tmpFn);\n *\n *   // To better support inline function the inline annotation is supported\n *   injector.invoke(['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfCompile, obfRootScope) {\n *     // ...\n *   }]);\n *\n *   // Therefore\n *   expect(injector.annotate(\n *      ['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfus_$compile, obfus_$rootScope) {}])\n *    ).toEqual(['$compile', '$rootScope']);\n * ```\n *\n * @param {Function|Array.<string|Function>} fn Function for which dependent service names need to\n * be retrieved as described above.\n *\n * @returns {Array.<string>} The names of the services which the function requires.\n */\n\n\n\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc service\n * @name $provide\n *\n * @description\n *\n * The {@link auto.$provide $provide} service has a number of methods for registering components\n * with the {@link auto.$injector $injector}.

Provider functions\n * are constructor functions, whose instances are responsible for \"providing\" a factory for a\n * service.\n *\n * Service provider names start with the name of the service they provide followed by `Provider`.\n * For example, the {@link ng.$log $log} service has a provider called\n * {@link ng.$logProvider $logProvider}.\n *\n * Service provider objects can have additional methods which allow configuration of the provider\n * and its service. Importantly, you can configure what kind of service is created by the `$get`\n * method, or how that service will act. For example, the {@link ng.$logProvider $logProvider} has a\n * method {@link ng.$logProvider#debugEnabled debugEnabled}\n * which lets you specify whether the {@link ng.$log $log} service will log debug messages to the\n * console or not.\n *\n * @param {string} name The name of the instance. NOTE: the provider will be available under `name +\n                        'Provider'` key.\n * @param {(Object|function())} provider If the provider is:\n *\n *   - `Object`: then it should have a `$get` method. The `$get` method will be invoked using\n *     {@link auto.$injector#invoke $injector.invoke()} when an instance needs to be created.\n *   - `Constructor`: a new instance of the provider will be created using\n *     {@link auto.$injector#instantiate $injector.instantiate()}, then treated as `object`.\n *\n * @returns {Object} registered provider instance\n\n * @example\n *\n * The following example shows how to create a simple event tracking service and register it using\n * {@link auto.$provide#provider $provide.provider()}.\n *\n * ```js\n *  // Define the eventTracker provider\n *  function EventTrackerProvider() {\n *    var trackingUrl = '/track';\n *\n *    // A provider method for configuring where the tracked events should been saved\n *    this.setTrackingUrl = function(url) {\n *      trackingUrl = url;\n *    };\n *\n *    // The service factory function\n *    this.$get = ['$http', function($http) {\n *      var trackedEvents = {};\n *      return {\n *        // Call this to track an event\n *        event: function(event) {\n *          var count = trackedEvents[event] || 0;\n *          count += 1;\n *          trackedEvents[event] = count;\n *          return count;\n *        },\n *        // Call this to save the tracked events to the trackingUrl\n *        save: function() {\n *          $http.post(trackingUrl, trackedEvents);\n *        }\n *      };\n *    }];\n *  }\n *\n *  describe('eventTracker', function() {\n *    var postSpy;\n *\n *    beforeEach(module(function($provide) {\n *      // Register the eventTracker provider\n *      $provide.provider('eventTracker', EventTrackerProvider);\n *    }));\n *\n *    beforeEach(module(function(eventTrackerProvider) {\n *      // Configure eventTracker provider\n *      eventTrackerProvider.setTrackingUrl('/custom-track');\n *    }));\n *\n *    it('tracks events', inject(function(eventTracker) {\n *      expect(eventTracker.event('login')).toEqual(1);\n *      expect(eventTracker.event('login')).toEqual(2);\n *    }));\n *\n *    it('saves to the tracking url', inject(function(eventTracker, $http) {\n *      postSpy = spyOn($http, 'post');\n *      eventTracker.event('login');\n *      eventTracker.save();\n *      expect(postSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();\n *      expect(postSpy.mostRecentCall.args[0]).not.toEqual('/track');\n *      expect(postSpy.mostRecentCall.args[0]).toEqual('/custom-track');\n *      expect(postSpy.mostRecentCall.args[1]).toEqual({ 'login': 1 });\n *    }));\n *  });\n * ```\n */\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc method\n * @name $provide#factory\n * @description\n *\n * Register a **service factory**, which will be called to return the service instance.\n * This is short for registering a service where its provider consists of only a `$get` property,\n * which is the given service factory function.\n * You should use {@link auto.$provide#factory $provide.factory(getFn)} if you do not need to\n * configure your service in a provider.\n *\n * @param {string} name The name of the instance.\n * @param {function()} $getFn The $getFn for the instance creation.

You can see the default values below.\n * </div>\n *\n * Therefore the above can be simplified as:\n *\n * ```js\n *   var myModule = angular.module(...);\n *\n *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {\n *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {\n *       link: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }\n *     };\n *     return directiveDefinitionObject;\n *     // or\n *     // return function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }\n *   });\n * ```\n *\n *\n *\n * ### Directive Definition Object\n *\n * The directive definition object provides instructions to the {@link ng.$compile\n * compiler}. The attributes are:\n *\n * #### `priority`\n * When there are multiple directives defined on a single DOM element, sometimes it\n * is necessary to specify the order in which the directives are applied. The `priority` is used\n * to sort the directives before their `compile` functions get called. Priority is defined as a\n * number. Directives with greater numerical `priority` are compiled first. Pre-link functions\n * are also run in priority order, but post-link functions are run in reverse order. The order\n * of directives with the same priority is undefined. The default priority is `0`.\n *\n * #### `terminal`\n * If set to true then the current `priority` will be the last set of directives\n * which will execute (any directives at the current priority will still execute\n * as the order of execution on same `priority` is undefined).\n *\n * #### `scope`\n * **If set to `true`,** then a new scope will be created for this directive. If multiple directives on the\n * same element request a new scope, only one new scope is created. The new scope rule does not\n * apply for the root of the template since the root of the template always gets a new scope.\n *\n * **If set to `{}` (object hash),** then a new \"isolate\" scope is created. The 'isolate' scope differs from\n * normal scope in that it does not prototypically inherit from the parent scope. This is useful\n * when creating reusable components, which should not accidentally read or modify data in the\n * parent scope.\n *\n * The 'isolate' scope takes an object hash which defines a set of local scope properties\n * derived from the parent scope. These local properties are useful for aliasing values for\n * templates. Locals definition is a hash of local scope property to its source:\n *\n * * `@` or `@attr` - bind a local scope property to the value of DOM attribute. The result is\n *   always a string since DOM attributes are strings. If no `attr` name is specified  then the\n *   attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.\n *   Given `<widget my-attr=\"hello {{name}}\">` and widget definition\n *   of `scope: { localName:'@myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localName` will reflect\n *   the interpolated value of `hello {{name}}`. As the `name` attribute changes so will the\n *   `localName` property on the widget scope. The `name` is read from the parent scope (not\n *   component scope).\n *\n * * `=` or `=attr` - set up bi-directional binding between a local scope property and the\n *   parent scope property of name defined via the value of the `attr` attribute. If no `attr`\n *   name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.\n *   Given `<widget my-attr=\"parentModel\">` and widget definition of\n *   `scope: { localModel:'=myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localModel` will reflect the\n *   value of `parentModel` on the parent scope. Any changes to `parentModel` will be reflected\n *   in `localModel` and any changes in `localModel` will reflect in `parentModel`. If the parent\n *   scope property doesn't exist, it will throw a NON_ASSIGNABLE_MODEL_EXPRESSION exception. You\n *   can avoid this behavior using `=?` or `=?attr` in order to flag the property as optional.\n *\n * * `&` or `&attr` - provides a way to execute an expression in the context of the parent scope.\n *   If no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the\n *   local name. Given `<widget my-attr=\"count = count + value\">` and widget definition of\n *   `scope: { localFn:'&myAttr' }`, then isolate scope property `localFn` will point to\n *   a function wrapper for the `count = count + value` expression. Often it's desirable to\n *   pass data from the isolated scope via an expression to the parent scope, this can be\n *   done by passing a map of local variable names and values into the expression wrapper fn.\n *   For example, if the expression is `increment(amount)` then we can specify the amount value\n *   by calling the `localFn` as `localFn({amount: 22})`.\n *\n *\n *\n * #### `controller`\n * Controller constructor function. The controller is instantiated before the\n * pre-linking phase and it is shared with other directives (see\n * `require` attribute). This allows the directives to communicate with each other and augment\n * each other's behavior. The controller is injectable (and supports bracket notation) with the following locals:\n *\n * * `$scope` - Current scope associated with the element\n * * `$element` - Current element\n * * `$attrs` - Current attributes object for the element\n * * `$transclude` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.\n *    The scope can be overridden by an optional first argument.\n *   `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn)`.\n *\n *\n * #### `require`\n * Require another directive and inject its controller as the fourth argument to the linking function. The\n * `require` takes a string name (or array of strings) of the directive(s) to pass in. If an array is used, the\n * injected argument will be an array in corresponding order. If no such directive can be\n * found, or if the directive does not have a controller, then an error is raised. The name can be prefixed with:\n *\n * * (no prefix) - Locate the required controller on the current element. Throw an error if not found.\n * * `?` - Attempt to locate the required controller or pass `null` to the `link` fn if not found.\n * * `^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents. Throw an error if not found.\n * * `?^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents or pass\n *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.\n *\n *\n * #### `controllerAs`\n * Controller alias at the directive scope. An alias for the controller so it\n * can be referenced at the directive template. The directive needs to define a scope for this\n * configuration to be used. Useful in the case when directive is used as component.\n *\n *\n * #### `restrict`\n * String of subset of `EACM` which restricts the directive to a specific directive\n * declaration style. If omitted, the default (attributes only) is used.\n *\n * * `E` - Element name: `<my-directive></my-directive>`\n * * `A` - Attribute (default): `<div my-directive=\"exp\"></div>`\n * * `C` - Class: `<div class=\"my-directive: exp;\"></div>`\n * * `M` - Comment: `<!-- directive: my-directive exp -->`\n *\n *\n * #### `template`\n * HTML markup that may:\n * * Replace the contents of the directive's element (default).\n * * Replace the directive's element itself (if `replace` is true - DEPRECATED).\n * * Wrap the contents of the directive's element (if `transclude` is true).\n *\n * Value may be:\n *\n * * A string. For example `<div red-on-hover>{{delete_str}}</div>`.\n * * A function which takes two arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile`\n *   function api below) and returns a string value.\n *\n *\n * #### `templateUrl`\n * Same as `template` but the template is loaded from the specified URL. Because\n * the template loading is asynchronous the compilation/linking is suspended until the template\n * is loaded.\n *\n * You can specify `templateUrl` as a string representing the URL or as a function which takes two\n * arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile` function api below) and returns\n * a string value representing the url.  In either case, the template URL is passed through {@link\n * api/ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl}.\n *\n *\n * #### `replace` ([*DEPRECATED*!], will be removed in next major release)\n * specify what the template should replace. Defaults to `false`.\n *\n * * `true` - the template will replace the directive's element.\n * * `false` - the template will replace the contents of the directive's element.\n *\n * The replacement process migrates all of the attributes / classes from the old element to the new\n * one. See the {@link guide/directive#creating-custom-directives_creating-directives_template-expanding-directive\n * Directives Guide} for an example.\n *\n * #### `transclude`\n * compile the content of the element and make it available to the directive.\n * Typically used with {@link ng.directive:ngTransclude\n * ngTransclude}. The advantage of transclusion is that the linking function receives a\n * transclusion function which is pre-bound to the correct scope. In a typical setup the widget\n * creates an `isolate` scope, but the transclusion is not a child, but a sibling of the `isolate`\n * scope. This makes it possible for the widget to have private state, and the transclusion to\n * be bound to the parent (pre-`isolate`) scope.\n *\n * There are two kinds of transclusion depending upon whether you want to transclude just the contents of the\n * directive's element or the entire element:\n *\n * * `true` - transclude the content (i.e. the child nodes) of the directive's element.\n * * `'element'` - transclude the whole of the directive's element including any directives on this\n *   element that defined at a lower priority than this directive. When used, the `template`\n *   property is ignored.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** When testing an element transclude directive you must not place the directive at the root of the\n * DOM fragment that is being compiled. See {@link guide/unit-testing#testing-transclusion-directives\n * Testing Transclusion Directives}.\n * </div>\n *\n * #### `compile`\n *\n * ```js\n *   function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * The compile function deals with transforming the template DOM. Since most directives do not do\n * template transformation, it is not used often. The compile function takes the following arguments:\n *\n *   * `tElement` - template element - The element where the directive has been declared. It is\n *     safe to do template transformation on the element and child elements only.\n *\n *   * `tAttrs` - template attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared\n *     between all directive compile functions.\n *\n *   * `transclude` -  [*DEPRECATED*!] A transclude linking function: `function(scope, cloneLinkingFn)`\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** The template instance and the link instance may be different objects if the template has\n * been cloned. For this reason it is **not** safe to do anything other than DOM transformations that\n * apply to all cloned DOM nodes within the compile function. Specifically, DOM listener registration\n * should be done in a linking function rather than in a compile function.\n * </div>\n\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** The compile function cannot handle directives that recursively use themselves in their\n * own templates or compile functions. Compiling these directives results in an infinite loop and a\n * stack overflow errors.\n *\n * This can be avoided by manually using $compile in the postLink function to imperatively compile\n * a directive's template instead of relying on automatic template compilation via `template` or\n * `templateUrl` declaration or manual compilation inside the compile function.\n * </div>\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-error\">\n * **Note:** The `transclude` function that is passed to the compile function is deprecated, as it\n *   e.g. does not know about the right outer scope. Please use the transclude function that is passed\n *   to the link function instead.\n * </div>\n\n * A compile function can have a return value which can be either a function or an object.\n *\n * * returning a (post-link) function - is equivalent to registering the linking function via the\n *   `link` property of the config object when the compile function is empty.\n *\n * * returning an object with function(s) registered via `pre` and `post` properties - allows you to\n *   control when a linking function should be called during the linking phase. See info about\n *   pre-linking and post-linking functions below.\n *\n *\n * #### `link`\n * This property is used only if the `compile` property is not defined.\n *\n * ```js\n *   function link(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller, transcludeFn) { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * The link function is responsible for registering DOM listeners as well as updating the DOM. It is\n * executed after the template has been cloned. This is where most of the directive logic will be\n * put.\n *\n *   * `scope` - {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} - The scope to be used by the\n *     directive for registering {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watches}.\n *\n *   * `iElement` - instance element - The element where the directive is to be used. It is safe to\n *     manipulate the children of the element only in `postLink` function since the children have\n *     already been linked.\n *\n *   * `iAttrs` - instance attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared\n *     between all directive linking functions.\n *\n *   * `controller` - a controller instance - A controller instance if at least one directive on the\n *     element defines a controller. The controller is shared among all the directives, which allows\n *     the directives to use the controllers as a communication channel.\n *\n *   * `transcludeFn` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.\n *     The scope can be overridden by an optional first argument. This is the same as the `$transclude`\n *     parameter of directive controllers.\n *     `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn)`.\n *\n *\n * #### Pre-linking function\n *\n * Executed before the child elements are linked. Not safe to do DOM transformation since the\n * compiler linking function will fail to locate the correct elements for linking.\n *\n * #### Post-linking function\n *\n * Executed after the child elements are linked. It is safe to do DOM transformation in the post-linking function.\n *\n * <a name=\"Attributes\"></a>\n * ### Attributes\n *\n * The {@link ng.$compile.directive.Attributes Attributes} object - passed as a parameter in the\n * `link()` or `compile()` functions. It has a variety of uses.\n *\n * accessing *Normalized attribute names:*\n * Directives like 'ngBind' can be expressed in many ways: 'ng:bind', `data-ng-bind`, or 'x-ng-bind'.\n * the attributes object allows for normalized access to\n *   the attributes.\n *\n * * *Directive inter-communication:* All directives share the same instance of the attributes\n *   object which allows the directives to use the attributes object as inter directive\n *   communication.\n *\n * * *Supports interpolation:* Interpolation attributes are assigned to the attribute object\n *   allowing other directives to read the interpolated value.\n *\n * * *Observing interpolated attributes:* Use `$observe` to observe the value changes of attributes\n *   that contain interpolation (e.g. `src=\"{{bar}}\"`). Not only is this very efficient but it's also\n *   the only way to easily get the actual value because during the linking phase the interpolation\n *   hasn't been evaluated yet and so the value is at this time set to `undefined`.\n *\n * ```js\n * function linkingFn(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) {\n *   // get the attribute value\n *   console.log(attrs.ngModel);\n *\n *   // change the attribute\n *   attrs.$set('ngModel', 'new value');\n *\n *   // observe changes to interpolated attribute\n *   attrs.$observe('ngModel', function(value) {\n *     console.log('ngModel has changed value to ' + value);\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ## Example\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note**: Typically directives are registered with `module.directive`. The example below is\n * to illustrate how `$compile` works.\n * </div>\n *\n <example module=\"compileExample\">\n   <file name=\"index.html\">\n    <script>\n      angular.module('compileExample', [], function($compileProvider) {\n        // configure new 'compile' directive by passing a directive\n        // factory function.

Where:\n *\n *  * `scope` - A {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} to bind to.\n *  * `cloneAttachFn` - If `cloneAttachFn` is provided, then the link function will clone the\n *  `template` and call the `cloneAttachFn` function allowing the caller to attach the\n *  cloned elements to the DOM document at the appropriate place. The `cloneAttachFn` is\n *  called as: <br> `cloneAttachFn(clonedElement, scope)` where:\n *\n *      * `clonedElement` - is a clone of the original `element` passed into the compiler.\n *      * `scope` - is the current scope with which the linking function is working with.\n *\n * Calling the linking function returns the element of the template. It is either the original\n * element passed in, or the clone of the element if the `cloneAttachFn` is provided.\n *\n * After linking the view is not updated until after a call to $digest which typically is done by\n * Angular automatically.\n *\n * If you need access to the bound view, there are two ways to do it:\n *\n * - If you are not asking the linking function to clone the template, create the DOM element(s)\n *   before you send them to the compiler and keep this reference around.\n *   ```js\n *     var element = $compile('<p>{{total}}</p>')(scope);\n *   ```\n *\n * - if on the other hand, you need the element to be cloned, the view reference from the original\n *   example would not point to the clone, but rather to the original template that was cloned. In\n *   this case, you can access the clone via the cloneAttachFn:\n *   ```js\n *     var templateElement = angular.element('<p>{{total}}</p>'),\n *         scope = ....;\n *\n *     var clonedElement = $compile(templateElement)(scope, function(clonedElement, scope) {\n *       //attach the clone to DOM document at the right place\n *     });\n *\n *     //now we have reference to the cloned DOM via `clonedElement`\n *   ```\n *\n *\n * For information on how the compiler works, see the\n * {@link guide/compiler Angular HTML Compiler} section of the Developer Guide.\n */\n\nvar $compileMinErr = minErr('$compile');\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc provider\n * @name $compileProvider\n * @kind function\n *\n * @description\n */\n$CompileProvider.$inject = ['$provide', '$$sanitizeUriProvider'];\nfunction $CompileProvider($provide, $$sanitizeUriProvider) {\n  var hasDirectives = {},\n      Suffix = 'Directive',\n      COMMENT_DIRECTIVE_REGEXP = /^\\s*directive\\:\\s*([\\d\\w_\\-]+)\\s+(.*)$/,\n      CLASS_DIRECTIVE_REGEXP = /(([\\d\\w_\\-]+)(?:\\:([^;]+))?;?)/;\n\n  // Ref: http://developers.whatwg.org/webappapis.html#event-handler-idl-attributes\n  // The assumption is that future DOM event attribute names will begin with\n  // 'on' and be composed of only English letters.\n  var EVENT_HANDLER_ATTR_REGEXP = /^(on[a-z]+|formaction)$/;\n\n  /**\n   * @ngdoc method\n   * @name $compileProvider#directive\n   * @kind function\n   *\n   * @description\n   * Register a new directive with the compiler.\n   *\n   * @param {string|Object} name Name of the directive in camel-case (i.e. <code>ngBind</code> which\n   *    will match as <code>ng-bind</code>), or an object map of directives where the keys are the\n   *    names and the values are the factories.\n   * @param {Function|Array} directiveFactory An injectable directive factory function.

See the API signature and type info below for more\n     * details.\n     *\n     * A response status code between 200 and 299 is considered a success status and\n     * will result in the success callback being called. Note that if the response is a redirect,\n     * XMLHttpRequest will transparently follow it, meaning that the error callback will not be\n     * called for such responses.\n     *\n     * # Writing Unit Tests that use $http\n     * When unit testing (using {@link ngMock ngMock}), it is necessary to call\n     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend#flush $httpBackend.flush()} to flush each pending\n     * request using trained responses.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * $httpBackend.expectGET(...);\n     * $http.get(...);\n     * $httpBackend.flush();\n     * ```\n     *\n     * # Shortcut methods\n     *\n     * Shortcut methods are also available. All shortcut methods require passing in the URL, and\n     * request data must be passed in for POST/PUT requests.\n     *\n     * ```js\n     *   $http.get('/someUrl').success(successCallback);\n     *   $http.post('/someUrl', data).success(successCallback);\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Complete list of shortcut methods:\n     *\n     * - {@link ng.$http#get $http.get}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#head $http.head}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#post $http.post}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#put $http.put}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#delete $http.delete}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#jsonp $http.jsonp}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#patch $http.patch}\n     *\n     *\n     * # Setting HTTP Headers\n     *\n     * The $http service will automatically add certain HTTP headers to all requests. These defaults\n     * can be fully configured by accessing the `$httpProvider.defaults.headers` configuration\n     * object, which currently contains this default configuration:\n     *\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common` (headers that are common for all requests):\n     *   - `Accept: application/json, text/plain, * / *`\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.post`: (header defaults for POST requests)\n     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.put` (header defaults for PUT requests)\n     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`\n     *\n     * To add or overwrite these defaults, simply add or remove a property from these configuration\n     * objects. To add headers for an HTTP method other than POST or PUT, simply add a new object\n     * with the lowercased HTTP method name as the key, e.g.\n     * `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.get = { 'My-Header' : 'value' }.\n     *\n     * The defaults can also be set at runtime via the `$http.defaults` object in the same\n     * fashion. For example:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * module.run(function($http) {\n     *   $http.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = 'Basic YmVlcDpib29w'\n     * });\n     * ```\n     *\n     * In addition, you can supply a `headers` property in the config object passed when\n     * calling `$http(config)`, which overrides the defaults without changing them globally.\n     *\n     * To explicitly remove a header automatically added via $httpProvider.defaults.headers on a per request basis,\n     * Use the `headers` property, setting the desired header to `undefined`. For example:\n     *\n     * ```js\n     * var req = {\n     *  method: 'POST',\n     *  url: 'http://example.com',\n     *  headers: {\n     *    'Content-Type': undefined\n     *  },\n     *  data: { test: 'test' },\n     * }\n     *\n     * $http(req).success(function(){...}).error(function(){...});\n     * ```\n     *\n     * # Transforming Requests and Responses\n     *\n     * Both requests and responses can be transformed using transform functions. By default, Angular\n     * applies these transformations:\n     *\n     * Request transformations:\n     *\n     * - If the `data` property of the request configuration object contains an object, serialize it\n     *   into JSON format.\n     *\n     * Response transformations:\n     *\n     *  - If XSRF prefix is detected, strip it (see Security Considerations section below).\n     *  - If JSON response is detected, deserialize it using a JSON parser.\n     *\n     * To globally augment or override the default transforms, modify the\n     * `$httpProvider.defaults.transformRequest` and `$httpProvider.defaults.transformResponse`\n     * properties. These properties are by default an array of transform functions, which allows you\n     * to `push` or `unshift` a new transformation function into the transformation chain. You can\n     * also decide to completely override any default transformations by assigning your\n     * transformation functions to these properties directly without the array wrapper.  These defaults\n     * are again available on the $http factory at run-time, which may be useful if you have run-time\n     * services you wish to be involved in your transformations.\n     *\n     * Similarly, to locally override the request/response transforms, augment the\n     * `transformRequest` and/or `transformResponse` properties of the configuration object passed\n     * into `$http`.\n     *\n     *\n     * # Caching\n     *\n     * To enable caching, set the request configuration `cache` property to `true` (to use default\n     * cache) or to a custom cache object (built with {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}).\n     * When the cache is enabled, `$http` stores the response from the server in the specified\n     * cache. The next time the same request is made, the response is served from the cache without\n     * sending a request to the server.\n     *\n     * Note that even if the response is served from cache, delivery of the data is asynchronous in\n     * the same way that real requests are.\n     *\n     * If there are multiple GET requests for the same URL that should be cached using the same\n     * cache, but the cache is not populated yet, only one request to the server will be made and\n     * the remaining requests will be fulfilled using the response from the first request.\n     *\n     * You can change the default cache to a new object (built with\n     * {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}) by updating the\n     * {@link ng.$http#properties_defaults `$http.defaults.cache`} property. All requests who set\n     * their `cache` property to `true` will now use this cache object.\n     *\n     * If you set the default cache to `false` then only requests that specify their own custom\n     * cache object will be cached.\n     *\n     * # Interceptors\n     *\n     * Before you start creating interceptors, be sure to understand the\n     * {@link ng.$q $q and deferred/promise APIs}.\n     *\n     * For purposes of global error handling, authentication, or any kind of synchronous or\n     * asynchronous pre-processing of request or postprocessing of responses, it is desirable to be\n     * able to intercept requests before they are handed to the server and\n     * responses before they are handed over to the application code that\n     * initiated these requests. The interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q\n     * promise APIs} to fulfill this need for both synchronous and asynchronous pre-processing.\n     *\n     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the `$httpProvider` by\n     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.interceptors` array. The factory is called and\n     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor.\n     *\n     * There are two kinds of interceptors (and two kinds of rejection interceptors):\n     *\n     *   * `request`: interceptors get called with a http `config` object. The function is free to\n     *     modify the `config` object or create a new one.

The response interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q\n     * promise apis} to fulfil this need for both synchronous and asynchronous preprocessing.\n     *\n     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the $httpProvider by\n     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.responseInterceptors` array. The factory is called and\n     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor  — a function that\n     * takes a {@link ng.$q promise} and returns the original or a new promise.\n     *\n     * ```js\n     *   // register the interceptor as a service\n     *   $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {\n     *     return function(promise) {\n     *       return promise.then(function(response) {\n     *         // do something on success\n     *         return response;\n     *       }, function(response) {\n     *         // do something on error\n     *         if (canRecover(response)) {\n     *           return responseOrNewPromise\n     *         }\n     *         return $q.reject(response);\n     *       });\n     *     }\n     *   });\n     *\n     *   $httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');\n     *\n     *\n     *   // register the interceptor via an anonymous factory\n     *   $httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push(function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {\n     *     return function(promise) {\n     *       // same as above\n     *     }\n     *   });\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     * # Security Considerations\n     *\n     * When designing web applications, consider security threats from:\n     *\n     * - [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)\n     * - [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)\n     *\n     * Both server and the client must cooperate in order to eliminate these threats. Angular comes\n     * pre-configured with strategies that address these issues, but for this to work backend server\n     * cooperation is required.\n     *\n     * ## JSON Vulnerability Protection\n     *\n     * A [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)\n     * allows third party website to turn your JSON resource URL into\n     * [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) request under some conditions. To\n     * counter this your server can prefix all JSON requests with following string `\")]}',\\n\"`.\n     * Angular will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.\n     *\n     * For example if your server needs to return:\n     * ```js\n     * ['one','two']\n     * ```\n     *\n     * which is vulnerable to attack, your server can return:\n     * ```js\n     * )]}',\n     * ['one','two']\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Angular will strip the prefix, before processing the JSON.\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Protection\n     *\n     * [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) is a technique by which\n     * an unauthorized site can gain your user's private data. Angular provides a mechanism\n     * to counter XSRF. When performing XHR requests, the $http service reads a token from a cookie\n     * (by default, `XSRF-TOKEN`) and sets it as an HTTP header (`X-XSRF-TOKEN`). Since only\n     * JavaScript that runs on your domain could read the cookie, your server can be assured that\n     * the XHR came from JavaScript running on your domain. The header will not be set for\n     * cross-domain requests.\n     *\n     * To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session\n     * cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on the first HTTP GET request. On subsequent XHR requests the\n     * server can verify that the cookie matches `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure\n     * that only JavaScript running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be\n     * unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server (to prevent the JavaScript from\n     * making up its own tokens). We recommend that the token is a digest of your site's\n     * authentication cookie with a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography&#41;)\n     * for added security.\n     *\n     * The name of the headers can be specified using the xsrfHeaderName and xsrfCookieName\n     * properties of either $httpProvider.defaults at config-time, $http.defaults at run-time,\n     * or the per-request config object.\n     *\n     *\n     * @param {object} config Object describing the request to be made and how it should be\n     *    processed. The object has following properties:\n     *\n     *    - **method** – `{string}` – HTTP method (e.g. 'GET', 'POST', etc)\n     *    - **url** – `{string}` – Absolute or relative URL of the resource that is being requested.\n     *    - **params** – `{Object.<string|Object>}` – Map of strings or objects which will be turned\n     *      to `?key1=value1&key2=value2` after the url. If the value is not a string, it will be\n     *      JSONified.\n     *    - **data** – `{string|Object}` – Data to be sent as the request message data.\n     *    - **headers** – `{Object}` – Map of strings or functions which return strings representing\n     *      HTTP headers to send to the server. If the return value of a function is null, the\n     *      header will not be sent.\n     *    - **xsrfHeaderName** – `{string}` – Name of HTTP header to populate with the XSRF token.\n     *    - **xsrfCookieName** – `{string}` – Name of cookie containing the XSRF token.\n     *    - **transformRequest** –\n     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –\n     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n     *      request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.\n     *    - **transformResponse** –\n     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –\n     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n     *      response body and headers and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.\n     *    - **cache** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the\n     *      GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with\n     *      {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory}, this cache will be used for\n     *      caching.\n     *    - **timeout** – `{number|Promise}` – timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise}\n     *      that should abort the request when resolved.\n     *    - **withCredentials** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the\n     *      XHR object. See [requests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Requests_with_credentials)\n     *      for more information.\n     *    - **responseType** - `{string}` - see\n     *      [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).\n     *\n     * @returns {HttpPromise} Returns a {@link ng.$q promise} object with the\n     *   standard `then` method and two http specific methods: `success` and `error`. The `then`\n     *   method takes two arguments a success and an error callback which will be called with a\n     *   response object. The `success` and `error` methods take a single argument - a function that\n     *   will be called when the request succeeds or fails respectively. The arguments passed into\n     *   these functions are destructured representation of the response object passed into the\n     *   `then` method. The response object has these properties:\n     *\n     *   - **data** – `{string|Object}` – The response body transformed with the transform\n     *     functions.\n     *   - **status** – `{number}` – HTTP status code of the response.\n     *   - **headers** – `{function([headerName])}` – Header getter function.\n     *   - **config** – `{Object}` – The configuration object that was used to generate the request.\n     *   - **statusText** – `{string}` – HTTP status text of the response.\n     *\n     * @property {Array.<Object>} pendingRequests Array of config objects for currently pending\n     *   requests. This is primarily meant to be used for debugging purposes.\n     *\n     *\n     * @example\n<example module=\"httpExample\">\n<file name=\"index.html\">\n  <div ng-controller=\"FetchController\">\n    <select ng-model=\"method\">\n      <option>GET</option>\n      <option>JSONP</option>\n    </select>\n    <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"url\" size=\"80\"/>\n    <button id=\"fetchbtn\" ng-click=\"fetch()\">fetch</button><br>\n    <button id=\"samplegetbtn\" ng-click=\"updateModel('GET', 'http-hello.html')\">Sample GET</button>\n    <button id=\"samplejsonpbtn\"\n      ng-click=\"updateModel('JSONP',\n                    'https://angularjs.org/greet.php?callback=JSON_CALLBACK&name=Super%20Hero')\">\n      Sample JSONP\n    </button>\n    <button id=\"invalidjsonpbtn\"\n      ng-click=\"updateModel('JSONP', 'https://angularjs.org/doesntexist&callback=JSON_CALLBACK')\">\n        Invalid JSONP\n      </button>\n    <pre>http status code: {{status}}</pre>\n    <pre>http response data: {{data}}</pre>\n  </div>\n</file>\n<file name=\"script.js\">\n  angular.module('httpExample', [])\n    .controller('FetchController', ['$scope', '$http', '$templateCache',\n      function($scope, $http, $templateCache) {\n        $scope.method = 'GET';\n        $scope.url = 'http-hello.html';\n\n        $scope.fetch = function() {\n          $scope.code = null;\n          $scope.response = null;\n\n          $http({method: $scope.method, url: $scope.url, cache: $templateCache}).\n            success(function(data, status) {\n              $scope.status = status;\n              $scope.data = data;\n            }).\n            error(function(data, status) {\n              $scope.data = data || \"Request failed\";\n              $scope.status = status;\n          });\n        };\n\n        $scope.updateModel = function(method, url) {\n          $scope.method = method;\n          $scope.url = url;\n        };\n      }]);\n</file>\n<file name=\"http-hello.html\">\n  Hello, $http!\n</file>\n<file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n  var status = element(by.binding('status'));\n  var data = element(by.binding('data'));\n  var fetchBtn = element(by.id('fetchbtn'));\n  var sampleGetBtn = element(by.id('samplegetbtn'));\n  var sampleJsonpBtn = element(by.id('samplejsonpbtn'));\n  var invalidJsonpBtn = element(by.id('invalidjsonpbtn'));\n\n  it('should make an xhr GET request', function() {\n    sampleGetBtn.click();\n    fetchBtn.click();\n    expect(status.getText()).toMatch('200');\n    expect(data.getText()).toMatch(/Hello, \\$http!/);\n  });\n\n// Commented out due to flakes.

The payoff\n * comes in the way of guarantees that promise and deferred APIs make, see\n * https://github.com/kriskowal/uncommonjs/blob/master/promises/specification.md.\n *\n * Additionally the promise api allows for composition that is very hard to do with the\n * traditional callback ([CPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)) approach.\n * For more on this please see the [Q documentation](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) especially the\n * section on serial or parallel joining of promises.\n *\n *\n * # The Deferred API\n *\n * A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling `$q.defer()`.\n *\n * The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance as well as APIs\n * that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion, as well as the status\n * of the task.\n *\n * **Methods**\n *\n * - `resolve(value)` – resolves the derived promise with the `value`. If the value is a rejection\n *   constructed via `$q.reject`, the promise will be rejected instead.\n * - `reject(reason)` – rejects the derived promise with the `reason`. This is equivalent to\n *   resolving it with a rejection constructed via `$q.reject`.\n * - `notify(value)` - provides updates on the status of the promise's execution. This may be called\n *   multiple times before the promise is either resolved or rejected.\n *\n * **Properties**\n *\n * - promise – `{Promise}` – promise object associated with this deferred.\n *\n *\n * # The Promise API\n *\n * A new promise instance is created when a deferred instance is created and can be retrieved by\n * calling `deferred.promise`.\n *\n * The purpose of the promise object is to allow for interested parties to get access to the result\n * of the deferred task when it completes.\n *\n * **Methods**\n *\n * - `then(successCallback, errorCallback, notifyCallback)` – regardless of when the promise was or\n *   will be resolved or rejected, `then` calls one of the success or error callbacks asynchronously\n *   as soon as the result is available. The callbacks are called with a single argument: the result\n *   or rejection reason. Additionally, the notify callback may be called zero or more times to\n *   provide a progress indication, before the promise is resolved or rejected.\n *\n *   This method *returns a new promise* which is resolved or rejected via the return value of the\n *   `successCallback`, `errorCallback`. It also notifies via the return value of the\n *   `notifyCallback` method. The promise can not be resolved or rejected from the notifyCallback\n *   method.\n *\n * - `catch(errorCallback)` – shorthand for `promise.then(null, errorCallback)`\n *\n *   Because `catch` is a reserved word in JavaScript and reserved keywords are not supported as\n *   property names by ES3, you'll need to invoke the method like `promise['catch'](callback)` or\n *  `promise.then(null, errorCallback)` to make your code IE8 and Android 2.x compatible.\n *\n * - `finally(callback)` – allows you to observe either the fulfillment or rejection of a promise,\n *   but to do so without modifying the final value. This is useful to release resources or do some\n *   clean-up that needs to be done whether the promise was rejected or resolved. See the [full\n *   specification](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promisefinallycallback) for\n *   more information.\n *\n *   Because `finally` is a reserved word in JavaScript and reserved keywords are not supported as\n *   property names by ES3, you'll need to invoke the method like `promise['finally'](callback)` to\n *   make your code IE8 and Android 2.x compatible.\n *\n * # Chaining promises\n *\n * Because calling the `then` method of a promise returns a new derived promise, it is easily\n * possible to create a chain of promises:\n *\n * ```js\n *   promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {\n *     return result + 1;\n *   });\n *\n *   // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value\n *   // will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1\n * ```\n *\n * It is possible to create chains of any length and since a promise can be resolved with another\n * promise (which will defer its resolution further), it is possible to pause/defer resolution of\n * the promises at any point in the chain. This makes it possible to implement powerful APIs like\n * $http's response interceptors.\n *\n *\n * # Differences between Kris Kowal's Q and $q\n *\n *  There are two main differences:\n *\n * - $q is integrated with the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope} Scope model observation\n *   mechanism in angular, which means faster propagation of resolution or rejection into your\n *   models and avoiding unnecessary browser repaints, which would result in flickering UI.\n * - Q has many more features than $q, but that comes at a cost of bytes. $q is tiny, but contains\n *   all the important functionality needed for common async tasks.\n *\n *  # Testing\n *\n *  ```js\n *    it('should simulate promise', inject(function($q, $rootScope) {\n *      var deferred = $q.defer();\n *      var promise = deferred.promise;\n *      var resolvedValue;\n *\n *      promise.then(function(value) { resolvedValue = value; });\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();\n *\n *      // Simulate resolving of promise\n *      deferred.resolve(123);\n *      // Note that the 'then' function does not get called synchronously.\n *      // This is because we want the promise API to always be async, whether or not\n *      // it got called synchronously or asynchronously.\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();\n *\n *      // Propagate promise resolution to 'then' functions using $apply().\n *      $rootScope.$apply();\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toEqual(123);\n *    }));\n *  ```\n */\nfunction $QProvider() {\n\n  this.$get = ['$rootScope', '$exceptionHandler', function($rootScope, $exceptionHandler) {\n    return qFactory(function(callback) {\n      $rootScope.$evalAsync(callback);\n    }, $exceptionHandler);\n  }];\n}\n\n\n/**\n * Constructs a promise manager.\n *\n * @param {function(Function)} nextTick Function for executing functions in the next turn.\n * @param {function(...*)} exceptionHandler Function into which unexpected exceptions are passed for\n *     debugging purposes.\n * @returns {object} Promise manager.\n */\nfunction qFactory(nextTick, exceptionHandler) {\n\n  /**\n   * @ngdoc method\n   * @name $q#defer\n   * @kind function\n   *\n   * @description\n   * Creates a `Deferred` object which represents a task which will finish in the future.\n   *\n   * @returns {Deferred} Returns a new instance of deferred.\n   */\n  var defer = function() {\n    var pending = [],\n        value, deferred;\n\n    deferred = {\n\n      resolve: function(val) {\n        if (pending) {\n          var callbacks = pending;\n          pending = undefined;\n          value = ref(val);\n\n          if (callbacks.length) {\n            nextTick(function() {\n              var callback;\n              for (var i = 0, ii = callbacks.length; i < ii; i++) {\n                callback = callbacks[i];\n                value.then(callback[0], callback[1], callback[2]);\n              }\n            });\n          }\n        }\n      },\n\n\n      reject: function(reason) {\n        deferred.resolve(createInternalRejectedPromise(reason));\n      },\n\n\n      notify: function(progress) {\n        if (pending) {\n          var callbacks = pending;\n\n          if (pending.length) {\n            nextTick(function() {\n              var callback;\n              for (var i = 0, ii = callbacks.length; i < ii; i++) {\n                callback = callbacks[i];\n                callback[2](progress);\n              }\n            });\n          }\n        }\n      },\n\n\n      promise: {\n        then: function(callback, errback, progressback) {\n          var result = defer();\n\n          var wrappedCallback = function(value) {\n            try {\n              result.resolve((isFunction(callback) ?

One example of\n * such a context is binding arbitrary html controlled by the user via `ng-bind-html`.  We refer\n * to these contexts as privileged or SCE contexts.\n *\n * As of version 1.2, Angular ships with SCE enabled by default.\n *\n * Note:  When enabled (the default), IE8 in quirks mode is not supported.  In this mode, IE8 allows\n * one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use of the expression() syntax.  Refer\n * <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx> to learn more about them.\n * You can ensure your document is in standards mode and not quirks mode by adding `<!doctype html>`\n * to the top of your HTML document.\n *\n * SCE assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b) makes auditing for\n * security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.\n *\n * Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:\n *\n * ```\n * <input ng-model=\"userHtml\">\n * <div ng-bind-html=\"userHtml\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that `ng-bind-html` is bound to `userHtml` controlled by the user.  With SCE\n * disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary HTML into the DIV.\n * In a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via\n * bindings.  (HTML is just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input creates\n * security vulnerabilities.)\n *\n * For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,\n * to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.\n *\n * How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that\n * was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you\n * ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some\n * properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?\n *\n * To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can\n * determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that\n * context.  You can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done\n * for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server,\n * sanitized by your library, etc.  You can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps\n * allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.  Ensuring that the internal API\n * exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task.\n *\n * In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses {@link ng.$sce#trustAs $sce.trustAs}\n * (and shorthand methods such as {@link ng.$sce#trustAsHtml $sce.trustAsHtml}, etc.) to\n * obtain values that will be accepted by SCE / privileged contexts.\n *\n *\n * ## How does it work?\n *\n * In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted\n * $sce.getTrusted(context, value)} rather than to the value directly.  Directives use {@link\n * ng.$sce#parse $sce.parseAs} rather than `$parse` to watch attribute bindings, which performs the\n * {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted} behind the scenes on non-constant literals.\n *\n * As an example, {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} uses {@link\n * ng.$sce#parseAsHtml $sce.parseAsHtml(binding expression)}.  Here's the actual code (slightly\n * simplified):\n *\n * ```\n * var ngBindHtmlDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {\n *   return function(scope, element, attr) {\n *     scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtml), function(value) {\n *       element.html(value || '');\n *     });\n *   };\n * }];\n * ```\n *\n * ## Impact on loading templates\n *\n * This applies both to the {@link ng.directive:ngInclude `ng-include`} directive as well as\n * `templateUrl`'s specified by {@link guide/directive directives}.\n *\n * By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and protocol as the application\n * document.  This is done by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl\n * $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL.  To load templates from other domains and/or\n * protocols, you may either either {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist\n * them} or {@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap it} into a trusted value.\n *\n * *Please note*:\n * The browser's\n * [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)\n * and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)\n * policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether the template is successfully\n * loaded.  This means that without the right CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain\n * won't work on all browsers.  Also, loading templates from `file://` URL does not work on some\n * browsers.\n *\n * ## This feels like too much overhead for the developer?\n *\n * It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.\n *\n * If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted and you don't need to\n * call `$sce.trustAs` on them (remember to include the `ngSanitize` module) (e.g.\n * `<div ng-bind-html=\"'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'\"></div>`) just works.\n *\n * Additionally, `a[href]` and `img[src]` automatically sanitize their URLs and do not pass them\n * through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted}.  SCE doesn't play a role here.\n *\n * The included {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} comes with sane defaults to allow you to load\n * templates in `ng-include` from your application's domain without having to even know about SCE.\n * It blocks loading templates from other domains or loading templates over http from an https\n * served document.  You can change these by setting your own custom {@link\n * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelists} and {@link\n * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist blacklists} for matching such URLs.\n *\n * This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the small overhead and have an\n * application that's secure and can be audited to verify that with much more ease than bolting\n * security onto an application later.\n *\n * <a name=\"contexts\"></a>\n * ## What trusted context types are supported?\n *\n * | Context             | Notes          |\n * |---------------------|----------------|\n * | `$sce.HTML`         | For HTML that's safe to source into the application.  The {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} directive uses this context for bindings. If an unsafe value is encountered and the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize} module is present this will sanitize the value instead of throwing an error. |\n * | `$sce.CSS`          | For CSS that's safe to source into the application.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |\n * | `$sce.URL`          | For URLs that are safe to follow as links.  Currently unused (`<a href=` and `<img src=` sanitize their urls and don't constitute an SCE context. |\n * | `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` | For URLs that are not only safe to follow as links, but whose contents are also safe to include in your application.  Examples include `ng-include`, `src` / `ngSrc` bindings for tags other than `IMG` (e.g. `IFRAME`, `OBJECT`, etc.)  <br><br>Note that `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.URL` does and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.URL` are required. |\n * | `$sce.JS`           | For JavaScript that is safe to execute in your application's context.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |\n *\n * ## Format of items in {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist resourceUrlWhitelist}/{@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist Blacklist} <a name=\"resourceUrlPatternItem\"></a>\n *\n *  Each element in these arrays must be one of the following:\n *\n *  - **'self'**\n *    - The special **string**, `'self'`, can be used to match against all URLs of the **same\n *      domain** as the application document using the **same protocol**.\n *  - **String** (except the special value `'self'`)\n *    - The string is matched against the full *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource\n *      being tested (substring matches are not good enough.)\n *    - There are exactly **two wildcard sequences** - `*` and `**`.  All other characters\n *      match themselves.\n *    - `*`: matches zero or more occurrences of any character other than one of the following 6\n *      characters: '`:`', '`/`', '`.`', '`?`', '`&`' and ';'.  It's a useful wildcard for use\n *      in a whitelist.\n *    - `**`: matches zero or more occurrences of *any* character.  As such, it's not\n *      not appropriate to use in for a scheme, domain, etc. as it would match too much.  (e.g.\n *      http://**.example.com/ would match http://evil.com/?ignore=.example.com/ and that might\n *      not have been the intention.)  Its usage at the very end of the path is ok.  (e.g.\n *      http://foo.example.com/templates/**).\n *  - **RegExp** (*see caveat below*)\n *    - *Caveat*:  While regular expressions are powerful and offer great flexibility,  their syntax\n *      (and all the inevitable escaping) makes them *harder to maintain*.  It's easy to\n *      accidentally introduce a bug when one updates a complex expression (imho, all regexes should\n *      have good test coverage.).  For instance, the use of `.` in the regex is correct only in a\n *      small number of cases.  A `.` character in the regex used when matching the scheme or a\n *      subdomain could be matched against a `:` or literal `.` that was likely not intended.   It\n *      is highly recommended to use the string patterns and only fall back to regular expressions\n *      if they as a last resort.\n *    - The regular expression must be an instance of RegExp (i.e. not a string.)  It is\n *      matched against the **entire** *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource being tested\n *      (even when the RegExp did not have the `^` and `$` codes.)  In addition, any flags\n *      present on the RegExp (such as multiline, global, ignoreCase) are ignored.\n *    - If you are generating your JavaScript from some other templating engine (not\n *      recommended, e.g. in issue [#4006](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4006)),\n *      remember to escape your regular expression (and be aware that you might need more than\n *      one level of escaping depending on your templating engine and the way you interpolated\n *      the value.)  Do make use of your platform's escaping mechanism as it might be good\n *      enough before coding your own.  e.g. Ruby has\n *      [Regexp.escape(str)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Regexp.html#method-c-escape)\n *      and Python has [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape).\n *      Javascript lacks a similar built in function for escaping.  Take a look at Google\n *      Closure library's [goog.string.regExpEscape(s)](\n *      http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_string_string.js.source.html#line962).\n *\n * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} for an example.\n *\n * ## Show me an example using SCE.\n *\n * <example module=\"mySceApp\" deps=\"angular-sanitize.js\">\n * <file name=\"index.html\">\n *   <div ng-controller=\"myAppController as myCtrl\">\n *     <i ng-bind-html=\"myCtrl.explicitlyTrustedHtml\" id=\"explicitlyTrustedHtml\"></i><br><br>\n *     <b>User comments</b><br>\n *     By default, HTML that isn't explicitly trusted (e.g. Alice's comment) is sanitized when\n *     $sanitize is available.

Normalizing means that a relative\n * URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.\n * Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related\n * properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide\n * compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+, Opera 7+,e etc.  See\n * http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html\n *\n * Implementation Notes for IE\n * ---------------------------\n * IE >= 8 and <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other\n * browsers.  However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify\n * them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = \"foo\", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We\n * work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized\n * URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.  This correctly populates the\n * properties such as protocol, hostname, port, etc.\n *\n * IE7 does not normalize the URL when assigned to an anchor node.  (Apparently, it does, if one\n * uses the inner HTML approach to assign the URL as part of an HTML snippet -\n * http://stackoverflow.com/a/472729)  However, setting img[src] does normalize the URL.\n * Unfortunately, setting img[src] to something like \"javascript:foo\" on IE throws an exception.\n * Since the primary usage for normalizing URLs is to sanitize such URLs, we can't use that\n * method and IE < 8 is unsupported.\n *\n * References:\n *   http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement\n *   http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html\n *   http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#urlutils\n *   https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/2902\n *   http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/parsing-urls-with-the-dom/\n *\n * @kind function\n * @param {string} url The URL to be parsed.\n * @description Normalizes and parses a URL.\n * @returns {object} Returns the normalized URL as a dictionary.\n *\n *   | member name   | Description    |\n *   |---------------|----------------|\n *   | href          | A normalized version of the provided URL if it was not an absolute URL |\n *   | protocol      | The protocol including the trailing colon                              |\n *   | host          | The host and port (if the port is non-default) of the normalizedUrl    |\n *   | search        | The search params, minus the question mark                             |\n *   | hash          | The hash string, minus the hash symbol\n *   | hostname      | The hostname\n *   | port          | The port, without \":\"\n *   | pathname      | The pathname, beginning with \"/\"\n *\n */\nfunction urlResolve(url, base) {\n  var href = url;\n\n  if (msie) {\n    // Normalize before parse.

Therefore, there is\n * no risk of inadvertently coding in a dependency on a global value in such an\n * expression.\n *\n * @example\n   <example module=\"windowExample\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <script>\n         angular.module('windowExample', [])\n           .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', '$window', function ($scope, $window) {\n             $scope.greeting = 'Hello, World!';\n             $scope.doGreeting = function(greeting) {\n               $window.alert(greeting);\n             };\n           }]);\n       </script>\n       <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n         <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"greeting\" />\n         <button ng-click=\"doGreeting(greeting)\">ALERT</button>\n       </div>\n     </file>\n     <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n      it('should display the greeting in the input box', function() {\n       element(by.model('greeting')).sendKeys('Hello, E2E Tests');\n       // If we click the button it will block the test runner\n       // element(':button').click();\n      });\n     </file>\n   </example>\n */\nfunction $WindowProvider(){\n  this.$get = valueFn(window);\n}\n\n/* global currencyFilter: true,\n dateFilter: true,\n filterFilter: true,\n jsonFilter: true,\n limitToFilter: true,\n lowercaseFilter: true,\n numberFilter: true,\n orderByFilter: true,\n uppercaseFilter: true,\n */\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc provider\n * @name $filterProvider\n * @description\n *\n * Filters are just functions which transform input to an output. However filters need to be\n * Dependency Injected. To achieve this a filter definition consists of a factory function which is\n * annotated with dependencies and is responsible for creating a filter function.\n *\n * ```js\n *   // Filter registration\n *   function MyModule($provide, $filterProvider) {\n *     // create a service to demonstrate injection (not always needed)\n *     $provide.value('greet', function(name){\n *       return 'Hello ' + name + '!';\n *     });\n *\n *     // register a filter factory which uses the\n *     // greet service to demonstrate DI.\n *     $filterProvider.register('greet', function(greet){\n *       // return the filter function which uses the greet service\n *       // to generate salutation\n *       return function(text) {\n *         // filters need to be forgiving so check input validity\n *         return text && greet(text) || text;\n *       };\n *     });\n *   }\n * ```\n *\n * The filter function is registered with the `$injector` under the filter name suffix with\n * `Filter`.\n *\n * ```js\n *   it('should be the same instance', inject(\n *     function($filterProvider) {\n *       $filterProvider.register('reverse', function(){\n *         return ...;\n *       });\n *     },\n *     function($filter, reverseFilter) {\n *       expect($filter('reverse')).toBe(reverseFilter);\n *     });\n * ```\n *\n *\n * For more information about how angular filters work, and how to create your own filters, see\n * {@link guide/filter Filters} in the Angular Developer Guide.\n */\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc service\n * @name $filter\n * @kind function\n * @description\n * Filters are used for formatting data displayed to the user.\n *\n * The general syntax in templates is as follows:\n *\n *         {{ expression [| filter_name[:parameter_value] ... ] }}\n *\n * @param {String} name Name of the filter function to retrieve\n * @return {Function} the filter function\n * @example\n   <example name=\"$filter\" module=\"filterExample\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <div ng-controller=\"MainCtrl\">\n        <h3>{{ originalText }}</h3>\n        <h3>{{ filteredText }}</h3>\n       </div>\n     </file>\n\n     <file name=\"script.js\">\n      angular.module('filterExample', [])\n      .controller('MainCtrl', function($scope, $filter) {\n        $scope.originalText = 'hello';\n        $scope.filteredText = $filter('uppercase')($scope.originalText);\n      });\n     </file>\n   </example>\n  */\n$FilterProvider.$inject = ['$provide'];\nfunction $FilterProvider($provide) {\n  var suffix = 'Filter';\n\n  /**\n   * @ngdoc method\n   * @name $filterProvider#register\n   * @param {string|Object} name Name of the filter function, or an object map of filters where\n   *    the keys are the filter names and the values are the filter factories.\n   * @returns {Object} Registered filter instance, or if a map of filters was provided then a map\n   *    of the registered filter instances.\n   */\n  function register(name, factory) {\n    if(isObject(name)) {\n      var filters = {};\n      forEach(name, function(filter, key) {\n        filters[key] = register(key, filter);\n      });\n      return filters;\n    } else {\n      return $provide.factory(name + suffix, factory);\n    }\n  }\n  this.register = register;\n\n  this.$get = ['$injector', function($injector) {\n    return function(name) {\n      return $injector.get(name + suffix);\n    };\n  }];\n\n  ////////////////////////////////////////\n\n  /* global\n    currencyFilter: false,\n    dateFilter: false,\n    filterFilter: false,\n    jsonFilter: false,\n    limitToFilter: false,\n    lowercaseFilter: false,\n    numberFilter: false,\n    orderByFilter: false,\n    uppercaseFilter: false,\n  */\n\n  register('currency', currencyFilter);\n  register('date', dateFilter);\n  register('filter', filterFilter);\n  register('json', jsonFilter);\n  register('limitTo', limitToFilter);\n  register('lowercase', lowercaseFilter);\n  register('number', numberFilter);\n  register('orderBy', orderByFilter);\n  register('uppercase', uppercaseFilter);\n}\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc filter\n * @name filter\n * @kind function\n *\n * @description\n * Selects a subset of items from `array` and returns it as a new array.\n *\n * @param {Array} array The source array.\n * @param {string|Object|function()} expression The predicate to be used for selecting items from\n *   `array`.\n *\n *   Can be one of:\n *\n *   - `string`: The string is evaluated as an expression and the resulting value is used for substring match against\n *     the contents of the `array`. All strings or objects with string properties in `array` that contain this string\n *     will be returned. The predicate can be negated by prefixing the string with `!`.\n *\n *   - `Object`: A pattern object can be used to filter specific properties on objects contained\n *     by `array`. For example `{name:\"M\", phone:\"1\"}` predicate will return an array of items\n *     which have property `name` containing \"M\" and property `phone` containing \"1\". A special\n *     property name `$` can be used (as in `{$:\"text\"}`) to accept a match against any\n *     property of the object. That's equivalent to the simple substring match with a `string`\n *     as described above. The predicate can be negated by prefixing the string with `!`.\n *     For Example `{name: \"!M\"}` predicate will return an array of items which have property `name`\n *     not containing \"M\".\n *\n *   - `function(value)`: A predicate function can be used to write arbitrary filters. The function is\n *     called for each element of `array`. The final result is an array of those elements that\n *     the predicate returned true for.\n *\n * @param {function(actual, expected)|true|undefined} comparator Comparator which is used in\n *     determining if the expected value (from the filter expression) and actual value (from\n *     the object in the array) should be considered a match.\n *\n *   Can be one of:\n *\n *   - `function(actual, expected)`:\n *     The function will be given the object value and the predicate value to compare and\n *     should return true if the item should be included in filtered result.\n *\n *   - `true`: A shorthand for `function(actual, expected) { return angular.equals(expected, actual)}`.\n *     this is essentially strict comparison of expected and actual.\n *\n *   - `false|undefined`: A short hand for a function which will look for a substring match in case\n *     insensitive way.\n *\n * @example\n   <example>\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <div ng-init=\"friends = [{name:'John', phone:'555-1276'},\n                                {name:'Mary', phone:'800-BIG-MARY'},\n                                {name:'Mike', phone:'555-4321'},\n                                {name:'Adam', phone:'555-5678'},\n                                {name:'Julie', phone:'555-8765'},\n                                {name:'Juliette', phone:'555-5678'}]\"></div>\n\n       Search: <input ng-model=\"searchText\">\n       <table id=\"searchTextResults\">\n         <tr><th>Name</th><th>Phone</th></tr>\n         <tr ng-repeat=\"friend in friends | filter:searchText\">\n           <td>{{friend.name}}</td>\n           <td>{{friend.phone}}</td>\n         </tr>\n       </table>\n       <hr>\n       Any: <input ng-model=\"search.$\"> <br>\n       Name only <input ng-model=\"search.name\"><br>\n       Phone only <input ng-model=\"search.phone\"><br>\n       Equality <input type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"strict\"><br>\n       <table id=\"searchObjResults\">\n         <tr><th>Name</th><th>Phone</th></tr>\n         <tr ng-repeat=\"friendObj in friends | filter:search:strict\">\n           <td>{{friendObj.name}}</td>\n           <td>{{friendObj.phone}}</td>\n         </tr>\n       </table>\n     </file>\n     <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n       var expectFriendNames = function(expectedNames, key) {\n         element.all(by.repeater(key + ' in friends').column(key + '.name')).then(function(arr) {\n           arr.forEach(function(wd, i) {\n             expect(wd.getText()).toMatch(expectedNames[i]);\n           });\n         });\n       };\n\n       it('should search across all fields when filtering with a string', function() {\n         var searchText = element(by.model('searchText'));\n         searchText.clear();\n         searchText.sendKeys('m');\n         expectFriendNames(['Mary', 'Mike', 'Adam'], 'friend');\n\n         searchText.clear();\n         searchText.sendKeys('76');\n         expectFriendNames(['John', 'Julie'], 'friend');\n       });\n\n       it('should search in specific fields when filtering with a predicate object', function() {\n         var searchAny = element(by.model('search.$'));\n         searchAny.clear();\n         searchAny.sendKeys('i');\n         expectFriendNames(['Mary', 'Mike', 'Julie', 'Juliette'], 'friendObj');\n       });\n       it('should use a equal comparison when comparator is true', function() {\n         var searchName = element(by.model('search.name'));\n         var strict = element(by.model('strict'));\n         searchName.clear();\n         searchName.sendKeys('Julie');\n         strict.click();\n         expectFriendNames(['Julie'], 'friendObj');\n       });\n     </file>\n   </example>\n */\nfunction filterFilter() {\n  return function(array, expression, comparator) {\n    if (!isArray(array)) return array;\n\n    var comparatorType = typeof(comparator),\n        predicates = [];\n\n    predicates.check = function(value) {\n      for (var j = 0;

The result of this function will be sorted using the\n *      `<`, `=`, `>` operator.\n *    - `string`: An Angular expression. The result of this expression is used to compare elements\n *      (for example `name` to sort by a property called `name` or `name.substr(0, 3)` to sort by\n *      3 first characters of a property called `name`). The result of a constant expression\n *      is interpreted as a property name to be used in comparisons (for example `\"special name\"`\n *      to sort object by the value of their `special name` property). An expression can be\n *      optionally prefixed with `+` or `-` to control ascending or descending sort order\n *      (for example, `+name` or `-name`). If no property is provided, (e.g. `'+'`) then the array\n *      element itself is used to compare where sorting.\n *    - `Array`: An array of function or string predicates.

This means that the outer form is valid when all of the child\n * forms are valid as well. However, browsers do not allow nesting of `<form>` elements, so\n * Angular provides the {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`} directive which behaves identically to\n * `<form>` but can be nested.  This allows you to have nested forms, which is very useful when\n * using Angular validation directives in forms that are dynamically generated using the\n * {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat`} directive. Since you cannot dynamically generate the `name`\n * attribute of input elements using interpolation, you have to wrap each set of repeated inputs in an\n * `ngForm` directive and nest these in an outer `form` element.\n *\n *\n * # CSS classes\n *  - `ng-valid` is set if the form is valid.\n *  - `ng-invalid` is set if the form is invalid.\n *  - `ng-pristine` is set if the form is pristine.\n *  - `ng-dirty` is set if the form is dirty.\n *\n * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.\n *\n *\n * # Submitting a form and preventing the default action\n *\n * Since the role of forms in client-side Angular applications is different than in classical\n * roundtrip apps, it is desirable for the browser not to translate the form submission into a full\n * page reload that sends the data to the server. Instead some javascript logic should be triggered\n * to handle the form submission in an application-specific way.\n *\n * For this reason, Angular prevents the default action (form submission to the server) unless the\n * `<form>` element has an `action` attribute specified.\n *\n * You can use one of the following two ways to specify what javascript method should be called when\n * a form is submitted:\n *\n * - {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit} directive on the form element\n * - {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directive on the first\n  *  button or input field of type submit (input[type=submit])\n *\n * To prevent double execution of the handler, use only one of the {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit}\n * or {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directives.\n * This is because of the following form submission rules in the HTML specification:\n *\n * - If a form has only one input field then hitting enter in this field triggers form submit\n * (`ngSubmit`)\n * - if a form has 2+ input fields and no buttons or input[type=submit] then hitting enter\n * doesn't trigger submit\n * - if a form has one or more input fields and one or more buttons or input[type=submit] then\n * hitting enter in any of the input fields will trigger the click handler on the *first* button or\n * input[type=submit] (`ngClick`) *and* a submit handler on the enclosing form (`ngSubmit`)\n *\n *\n * ## Animation Hooks\n *\n * Animations in ngForm are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed.\n * These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`, `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any\n * other validations that are performed within the form. Animations in ngForm are similar to how\n * they work in ngClass and animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well\n * as JS animations.\n *\n * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style a form element\n * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:\n *\n * <pre>\n * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more\n * //advanced animations\n * .my-form {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   background: white;\n * }\n * .my-form.ng-invalid {\n *   background: red;\n *   color:white;\n * }\n * </pre>\n *\n * @example\n    <example deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\" fixBase=\"true\" module=\"formExample\">\n      <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <script>\n         angular.module('formExample', [])\n           .controller('FormController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n             $scope.userType = 'guest';\n           }]);\n       </script>\n       <style>\n        .my-form {\n          -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;\n          transition:all linear 0.5s;\n          background: transparent;\n        }\n        .my-form.ng-invalid {\n          background: red;\n        }\n       </style>\n       <form name=\"myForm\" ng-controller=\"FormController\" class=\"my-form\">\n         userType: <input name=\"input\" ng-model=\"userType\" required>\n         <span class=\"error\" ng-show=\"myForm.input.$error.required\">Required!</span><br>\n         <tt>userType = {{userType}}</tt><br>\n         <tt>myForm.input.$valid = {{myForm.input.$valid}}</tt><br>\n         <tt>myForm.input.$error = {{myForm.input.$error}}</tt><br>\n         <tt>myForm.$valid = {{myForm.$valid}}</tt><br>\n         <tt>myForm.$error.required = {{!!myForm.$error.required}}</tt><br>\n        </form>\n      </file>\n      <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n        it('should initialize to model', function() {\n          var userType = element(by.binding('userType'));\n          var valid = element(by.binding('myForm.input.$valid'));\n\n          expect(userType.getText()).toContain('guest');\n          expect(valid.getText()).toContain('true');\n        });\n\n        it('should be invalid if empty', function() {\n          var userType = element(by.binding('userType'));\n          var valid = element(by.binding('myForm.input.$valid'));\n          var userInput = element(by.model('userType'));\n\n          userInput.clear();\n          userInput.sendKeys('');\n\n          expect(userType.getText()).toEqual('userType =');\n          expect(valid.getText()).toContain('false');\n        });\n      </file>\n    </example>\n *\n * @param {string=} name Name of the form.

The controller contains\n * services for data-binding, validation, CSS updates, and value formatting and parsing.

Such DOM related logic should be provided by other directives which make use of\n * `NgModelController` for data-binding.\n *\n * ## Custom Control Example\n * This example shows how to use `NgModelController` with a custom control to achieve\n * data-binding. Notice how different directives (`contenteditable`, `ng-model`, and `required`)\n * collaborate together to achieve the desired result.\n *\n * Note that `contenteditable` is an HTML5 attribute, which tells the browser to let the element\n * contents be edited in place by the user.  This will not work on older browsers.\n *\n * We are using the {@link ng.service:$sce $sce} service here and include the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize}\n * module to automatically remove \"bad\" content like inline event listener (e.g. `<span onclick=\"...\">`).\n * However, as we are using `$sce` the model can still decide to provide unsafe content if it marks\n * that content using the `$sce` service.\n *\n * <example name=\"NgModelController\" module=\"customControl\" deps=\"angular-sanitize.js\">\n    <file name=\"style.css\">\n      [contenteditable] {\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        background-color: white;\n        min-height: 20px;\n      }\n\n      .ng-invalid {\n        border: 1px solid red;\n      }\n\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"script.js\">\n      angular.module('customControl', ['ngSanitize']).\n        directive('contenteditable', ['$sce', function($sce) {\n          return {\n            restrict: 'A', // only activate on element attribute\n            require: '?ngModel', // get a hold of NgModelController\n            link: function(scope, element, attrs, ngModel) {\n              if(!ngModel) return; // do nothing if no ng-model\n\n              // Specify how UI should be updated\n              ngModel.$render = function() {\n                element.html($sce.getTrustedHtml(ngModel.$viewValue || ''));\n              };\n\n              // Listen for change events to enable binding\n              element.on('blur keyup change', function() {\n                scope.$evalAsync(read);\n              });\n              read(); // initialize\n\n              // Write data to the model\n              function read() {\n                var html = element.html();\n                // When we clear the content editable the browser leaves a <br> behind\n                // If strip-br attribute is provided then we strip this out\n                if( attrs.stripBr && html == '<br>' ) {\n                  html = '';\n                }\n                ngModel.$setViewValue(html);\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        }]);\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      <form name=\"myForm\">\n       <div contenteditable\n            name=\"myWidget\" ng-model=\"userContent\"\n            strip-br=\"true\"\n            required>Change me!</div>\n        <span ng-show=\"myForm.myWidget.$error.required\">Required!</span>\n       <hr>\n       <textarea ng-model=\"userContent\"></textarea>\n      </form>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n    it('should data-bind and become invalid', function() {\n      if (browser.params.browser == 'safari' || browser.params.browser == 'firefox') {\n        // SafariDriver can't handle contenteditable\n        // and Firefox driver can't clear contenteditables very well\n        return;\n      }\n      var contentEditable = element(by.css('[contenteditable]'));\n      var content = 'Change me!';\n\n      expect(contentEditable.getText()).toEqual(content);\n\n      contentEditable.clear();\n      contentEditable.sendKeys(protractor.Key.BACK_SPACE);\n      expect(contentEditable.getText()).toEqual('');\n      expect(contentEditable.getAttribute('class')).toMatch(/ng-invalid-required/);\n    });\n    </file>\n * </example>\n *\n *\n */\nvar NgModelController = ['$scope', '$exceptionHandler', '$attrs', '$element', '$parse', '$animate',\n    function($scope, $exceptionHandler, $attr, $element, $parse, $animate) {\n  this.$viewValue = Number.NaN;\n  this.$modelValue = Number.NaN;\n  this.$parsers = [];\n  this.$formatters = [];\n  this.$viewChangeListeners = [];\n  this.$pristine = true;\n  this.$dirty = false;\n  this.$valid = true;\n  this.$invalid = false;\n  this.$name = $attr.name;\n\n  var ngModelGet = $parse($attr.ngModel),\n      ngModelSet = ngModelGet.assign;\n\n  if (!ngModelSet) {\n    throw minErr('ngModel')('nonassign', \"Expression '{0}' is non-assignable.

This is a key aspect of how angular\n * supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.\n *\n * MVC components in angular:\n *\n * * Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties\n *   are accessed through bindings.\n * * View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.\n * * Controller — The `ngController` directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business\n *   logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values\n *\n * Note that you can also attach controllers to the DOM by declaring it in a route definition\n * via the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. A common mistake is to declare the controller\n * again using `ng-controller` in the template itself.  This will cause the controller to be attached\n * and executed twice.\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 500\n * @param {expression} ngController Name of a globally accessible constructor function or an\n *     {@link guide/expression expression} that on the current scope evaluates to a\n *     constructor function. The controller instance can be published into a scope property\n *     by specifying `as propertyName`.\n *\n * @example\n * Here is a simple form for editing user contact information. Adding, removing, clearing, and\n * greeting are methods declared on the controller (see source tab). These methods can\n * easily be called from the angular markup. Any changes to the data are automatically reflected\n * in the View without the need for a manual update.\n *\n * Two different declaration styles are included below:\n *\n * * one binds methods and properties directly onto the controller using `this`:\n * `ng-controller=\"SettingsController1 as settings\"`\n * * one injects `$scope` into the controller:\n * `ng-controller=\"SettingsController2\"`\n *\n * The second option is more common in the Angular community, and is generally used in boilerplates\n * and in this guide. However, there are advantages to binding properties directly to the controller\n * and avoiding scope.\n *\n * * Using `controller as` makes it obvious which controller you are accessing in the template when\n * multiple controllers apply to an element.\n * * If you are writing your controllers as classes you have easier access to the properties and\n * methods, which will appear on the scope, from inside the controller code.\n * * Since there is always a `.` in the bindings, you don't have to worry about prototypal\n * inheritance masking primitives.\n *\n * This example demonstrates the `controller as` syntax.\n *\n * <example name=\"ngControllerAs\" module=\"controllerAsExample\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *    <div id=\"ctrl-as-exmpl\"

If the expression assigned to `ngIf` evaluates to a false\n * value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the\n * element is reinserted into the DOM.\n *\n * `ngIf` differs from `ngShow` and `ngHide` in that `ngIf` completely removes and recreates the\n * element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the `display` css property.  A common\n * case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's\n * position within the DOM, such as the `:first-child` or `:last-child` pseudo-classes.\n *\n * Note that when an element is removed using `ngIf` its scope is destroyed and a new scope\n * is created when the element is restored.  The scope created within `ngIf` inherits from\n * its parent scope using\n * [prototypal inheritance](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes#javascript-prototypal-inheritance).\n * An important implication of this is if `ngModel` is used within `ngIf` to bind to\n * a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the\n * variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.\n *\n * Also, `ngIf` recreates elements using their compiled state. An example of this behavior\n * is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like\n * jQuery's `.addClass()` method, and the element is later removed. When `ngIf` recreates the element\n * the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.\n *\n * Additionally, you can provide animations via the `ngAnimate` module to animate the `enter`\n * and `leave` effects.\n *\n * @animations\n * enter - happens just after the `ngIf` contents change and a new DOM element is created and injected into the `ngIf` container\n * leave - happens just before the `ngIf` contents are removed from the DOM\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 600\n * @param {expression} ngIf If the {@link guide/expression expression} is falsy then\n *     the element is removed from the DOM tree.

You configure ngPluralize directive\n * by specifying the mappings between\n * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)\n * and the strings to be displayed.\n *\n * # Plural categories and explicit number rules\n * There are two\n * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)\n * in Angular's default en-US locale: \"one\" and \"other\".\n *\n * While a plural category may match many numbers (for example, in en-US locale, \"other\" can match\n * any number that is not 1), an explicit number rule can only match one number. For example, the\n * explicit number rule for \"3\" matches the number 3. There are examples of plural categories\n * and explicit number rules throughout the rest of this documentation.\n *\n * # Configuring ngPluralize\n * You configure ngPluralize by providing 2 attributes: `count` and `when`.\n * You can also provide an optional attribute, `offset`.\n *\n * The value of the `count` attribute can be either a string or an {@link guide/expression\n * Angular expression}; these are evaluated on the current scope for its bound value.\n *\n * The `when` attribute specifies the mappings between plural categories and the actual\n * string to be displayed. The value of the attribute should be a JSON object.\n *\n * The following example shows how to configure ngPluralize:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ng-pluralize count=\"personCount\"\n                 when=\"{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',\n *                      'one': '1 person is viewing.',\n *                      'other': '{} people are viewing.'}\">\n * </ng-pluralize>\n *```\n *\n * In the example, `\"0: Nobody is viewing.\"` is an explicit number rule. If you did not\n * specify this rule, 0 would be matched to the \"other\" category and \"0 people are viewing\"\n * would be shown instead of \"Nobody is viewing\". You can specify an explicit number rule for\n * other numbers, for example 12, so that instead of showing \"12 people are viewing\", you can\n * show \"a dozen people are viewing\".\n *\n * You can use a set of closed braces (`{}`) as a placeholder for the number that you want substituted\n * into pluralized strings. In the previous example, Angular will replace `{}` with\n * <span ng-non-bindable>`{{personCount}}`</span>. The closed braces `{}` is a placeholder\n * for <span ng-non-bindable>{{numberExpression}}</span>.\n *\n * # Configuring ngPluralize with offset\n * The `offset` attribute allows further customization of pluralized text, which can result in\n * a better user experience. For example, instead of the message \"4 people are viewing this document\",\n * you might display \"John, Kate and 2 others are viewing this document\".\n * The offset attribute allows you to offset a number by any desired value.\n * Let's take a look at an example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ng-pluralize count=\"personCount\" offset=2\n *               when=\"{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',\n *                      '1': '{{person1}} is viewing.',\n *                      '2': '{{person1}} and {{person2}} are viewing.',\n *                      'one': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and one other person are viewing.',\n *                      'other': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and {} other people are viewing.'}\">\n * </ng-pluralize>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that we are still using two plural categories(one, other), but we added\n * three explicit number rules 0, 1 and 2.\n * When one person, perhaps John, views the document, \"John is viewing\" will be shown.\n * When three people view the document, no explicit number rule is found, so\n * an offset of 2 is taken off 3, and Angular uses 1 to decide the plural category.\n * In this case, plural category 'one' is matched and \"John, Mary and one other person are viewing\"\n * is shown.\n *\n * Note that when you specify offsets, you must provide explicit number rules for\n * numbers from 0 up to and including the offset. If you use an offset of 3, for example,\n * you must provide explicit number rules for 0, 1, 2 and 3. You must also provide plural strings for\n * plural categories \"one\" and \"other\".\n *\n * @param {string|expression} count The variable to be bound to.\n * @param {string} when The mapping between plural category to its corresponding strings.\n * @param {number=} offset Offset to deduct from the total number.\n *\n * @example\n    <example module=\"pluralizeExample\">\n      <file

Each template\n * instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item,\n * and `$index` is set to the item index or key.\n *\n * Special properties are exposed on the local scope of each template instance, including:\n *\n * | Variable  | Type            | Details                                                                     |\n * |-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | `$index`  | {@type number}  | iterator offset of the repeated element (0..length-1)                       |\n * | `$first`  | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is first in the iterator.                      |\n * | `$middle` | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is between the first and last in the iterator. |\n * | `$last`   | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is last in the iterator.                       |\n * | `$even`   | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is even (otherwise false).           |\n * | `$odd`    | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is odd (otherwise false).            |\n *\n * Creating aliases for these properties is possible with {@link ng.directive:ngInit `ngInit`}.\n * This may be useful when, for instance, nesting ngRepeats.\n *\n * # Special repeat start and end points\n * To repeat a series of elements instead of just one parent element, ngRepeat (as well as other ng directives) supports extending\n * the range of the repeater by defining explicit start and end points by using **ng-repeat-start** and **ng-repeat-end** respectively.\n * The **ng-repeat-start** directive works the same as **ng-repeat**, but will repeat all the HTML code (including the tag it's defined on)\n * up to and including the ending HTML tag where **ng-repeat-end** is placed.\n *\n * The example below makes use of this feature:\n * ```html\n *   <header ng-repeat-start=\"item in items\">\n *     Header {{ item }}\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body {{ item }}\n *   </div>\n *   <footer ng-repeat-end>\n *     Footer {{ item }}\n *   </footer>\n * ```\n *\n * And with an input of {@type ['A','B']} for the items variable in the example above, the output will evaluate to:\n * ```html\n *   <header>\n *     Header A\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body A\n *   </div>\n *   <footer>\n *     Footer A\n *   </footer>\n *   <header>\n *     Header B\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body B\n *   </div>\n *   <footer>\n *     Footer B\n *   </footer>\n * ```\n *\n * The custom start and end points for ngRepeat also support all other HTML directive syntax flavors provided in AngularJS (such\n * as **data-ng-repeat-start**, **x-ng-repeat-start** and **ng:repeat-start**).\n *\n * @animations\n * **.enter** - when a new item is added to the list or when an item is revealed after a filter\n *\n * **.leave** - when an item is removed from the list or when an item is filtered out\n *\n * **.move** - when an adjacent item is filtered out causing a reorder or when the item contents are reordered\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 1000\n * @param {repeat_expression} ngRepeat The expression indicating how to enumerate a collection. These\n *   formats are currently supported:\n *\n *   * `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and `expression`\n *     is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.\n *\n *     For example: `album in artist.albums`.\n *\n *   * `(key, value) in expression` – where `key` and `value` can be any user defined identifiers,\n *     and `expression` is the scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.\n *\n *     For example: `(name, age) in {'adam':10, 'amalie':12}`.\n *\n *   * `variable in expression track by tracking_expression` – You can also provide an optional tracking function\n *     which can be used to associate the objects in the collection with the DOM elements. If no tracking function\n *     is specified the ng-repeat associates elements by identity in the collection. It is an error to have\n *     more than one tracking function to resolve to the same key. (This would mean that two distinct objects are\n *     mapped to the same DOM element, which is not possible.)  Filters should be applied to the expression,\n *     before specifying a tracking expression.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items` is equivalent to `item in items track by $id(item)`. This implies that the DOM elements\n *     will be associated by item identity in the array.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items track by $id(item)`. A built in `$id()` function can be used to assign a unique\n *     `$$hashKey` property to each item in the array. This property is then used as a key to associated DOM elements\n *     with the corresponding item in the array by identity. Moving the same object in array would move the DOM\n *     element in the same way in the DOM.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items track by item.id` is a typical pattern when the items come from the database. In this\n *     case the object identity does not matter. Two objects are considered equivalent as long as their `id`\n *     property is same.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items | filter:searchText track by item.id` is a pattern that might be used to apply a filter\n *     to items in conjunction with a tracking expression.\n *\n * @example\n * This example initializes the scope to a list of names and\n * then uses `ngRepeat` to display every person:\n  <example module=\"ngAnimate\" deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      <div ng-init=\"friends = [\n        {name:'John', age:25, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Jessie', age:30, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Johanna', age:28, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Joy', age:15, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Mary', age:28, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Peter', age:95, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Sebastian', age:50, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Erika', age:27, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Patrick', age:40, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Samantha', age:60, gender:'girl'}\n      ]\">\n        I have {{friends.length}} friends.

The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding\n * the `.ng-hide` CSS class onto the element. The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined\n * in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an !important flag).\n * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is visible) -->\n * <div ng-show=\"myValue\"></div>\n *\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is hidden) -->\n * <div ng-show=\"myValue\" class=\"ng-hide\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * When the `ngShow` expression evaluates to false then the `.ng-hide` CSS class is added to the class attribute\n * on the element causing it to become hidden. When true, the `.ng-hide` CSS class is removed\n * from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** Here is a list of values that ngShow will consider as a falsy value (case insensitive):<br />\n * \"f\" / \"0\" / \"false\" / \"no\" / \"n\" / \"[]\"\n * </div>\n *\n * ## Why is !important used?\n *\n * You may be wondering why !important is used for the `.ng-hide` CSS class. This is because the `.ng-hide` selector\n * can be easily overridden by heavier selectors. For example, something as simple\n * as changing the display style on a HTML list item would make hidden elements appear visible.\n * This also becomes a bigger issue when dealing with CSS frameworks.\n *\n * By using !important, the show and hide behavior will work as expected despite any clash between CSS selector\n * specificity (when !important isn't used with any conflicting styles). If a developer chooses to override the\n * styling to change how to hide an element then it is just a matter of using !important in their own CSS code.\n *\n * ### Overriding `.ng-hide`\n *\n * By default, the `.ng-hide` class will style the element with `display:none!important`. If you wish to change\n * the hide behavior with ngShow/ngHide then this can be achieved by restating the styles for the `.ng-hide`\n * class in CSS:\n *\n * ```css\n * .ng-hide {\n *   //this is just another form of hiding an element\n *   display:block!important;\n *   position:absolute;\n *   top:-9999px;\n *   left:-9999px;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * By default you don't need to override in CSS anything and the animations will work around the display style.\n *\n * ## A note about animations with `ngShow`\n *\n * Animations in ngShow/ngHide work with the show and hide events that are triggered when the directive expression\n * is true and false. This system works like the animation system present with ngClass except that\n * you must also include the !important flag to override the display property\n * so that you can perform an animation when the element is hidden during the time of the animation.\n *\n * ```css\n * //\n * //a working example can be found at the bottom of this page\n * //\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add, .my-element.ng-hide-remove {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n * }\n *\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-remove { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * Keep in mind that, as of AngularJS version 1.2.17 (and 1.3.0-beta.11), there is no need to change the display\n * property to block during animation states--ngAnimate will handle the style toggling automatically for you.\n *\n * @animations\n * addClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a truthy value and the just before contents are set to visible\n * removeClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a non truthy value and just before the contents are set to hidden\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @param {expression} ngShow If the {@link guide/expression expression} is truthy\n *     then the element is shown or hidden respectively.\n *\n * @example\n  <example module=\"ngAnimate\" deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      Click me: <input type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"checked\"><br/>\n      <div>\n        Show:\n        <div class=\"check-element animate-show\" ng-show=\"checked\">\n          <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up\"></span> I show up when your checkbox is checked.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        Hide:\n        <div class=\"check-element animate-show\" ng-hide=\"checked\">\n          <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-down\"></span> I hide when your checkbox is checked.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"glyphicons.css\">\n      @import url(//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/css/bootstrap-glyphicons.css);\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"animations.css\">\n      .animate-show {\n        -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;\n        transition:all linear 0.5s;\n        line-height:20px;\n        opacity:1;\n        padding:10px;\n        border:1px solid black;\n        background:white;\n      }\n\n      .animate-show.ng-hide {\n        line-height:0;\n        opacity:0;\n        padding:0 10px;\n      }\n\n      .check-element {\n        padding:10px;\n        border:1px solid black;\n        background:white;\n      }\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n      var thumbsUp = element(by.css('span.glyphicon-thumbs-up'));\n      var thumbsDown = element(by.css('span.glyphicon-thumbs-down'));\n\n      it('should check ng-show / ng-hide', function() {\n        expect(thumbsUp.isDisplayed()).toBeFalsy();\n        expect(thumbsDown.isDisplayed()).toBeTruthy();\n\n        element(by.model('checked')).click();\n\n        expect(thumbsUp.isDisplayed()).toBeTruthy();\n        expect(thumbsDown.isDisplayed()).toBeFalsy();\n      });\n    </file>\n  </example>\n */\nvar ngShowDirective = ['$animate', function($animate) {\n  return function(scope, element, attr) {\n    scope.$watch(attr.ngShow, function ngShowWatchAction(value){\n      $animate[toBoolean(value) ?

The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding\n * the `ng-hide` CSS class onto the element. The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined\n * in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an !important flag).\n * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is hidden) -->\n * <div ng-hide=\"myValue\" class=\"ng-hide\"></div>\n *\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is visible) -->\n * <div ng-hide=\"myValue\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * When the `.ngHide` expression evaluates to true then the `.ng-hide` CSS class is added to the class attribute\n * on the element causing it to become hidden. When false, the `.ng-hide` CSS class is removed\n * from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** Here is a list of values that ngHide will consider as a falsy value (case insensitive):<br />\n * \"f\" / \"0\" / \"false\" / \"no\" / \"n\" / \"[]\"\n * </div>\n *\n * ## Why is !important used?\n *\n * You may be wondering why !important is used for the `.ng-hide` CSS class. This is because the `.ng-hide` selector\n * can be easily overridden by heavier selectors. For example, something as simple\n * as changing the display style on a HTML list item would make hidden elements appear visible.\n * This also becomes a bigger issue when dealing with CSS frameworks.\n *\n * By using !important, the show and hide behavior will work as expected despite any clash between CSS selector\n * specificity (when !important isn't used with any conflicting styles). If a developer chooses to override the\n * styling to change how to hide an element then it is just a matter of using !important in their own CSS code.\n *\n * ### Overriding `.ng-hide`\n *\n * By default, the `.ng-hide` class will style the element with `display:none!important`. If you wish to change\n * the hide behavior with ngShow/ngHide then this can be achieved by restating the styles for the `.ng-hide`\n * class in CSS:\n *\n * ```css\n * .ng-hide {\n *   //this is just another form of hiding an element\n *   display:block!important;\n *   position:absolute;\n *   top:-9999px;\n *   left:-9999px;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * By default you don't need to override in CSS anything and the animations will work around the display style.\n *\n * ## A note about animations with `ngHide`\n *\n * Animations in ngShow/ngHide work with the show and hide events that are triggered when the directive expression\n * is true and false.
