# Kibana Dev Scripts

This directory contains scripts useful for interacting with Kibana tools in development. Use the node executable and `--help` flag to learn about how they work:

```sh
node scripts/{{script name}} --help
```

## For Developers

This directory is excluded from the build and tools within it should help users discover their capabilities. Each script in this directory must:

- require `src/setup_node_env` to bootstrap NodeJS environment
- call out to source code in the [`src`](../src) or [`packages`](../packages) directories
- react to the `--help` flag
- run everywhere OR check and fail fast when a required OS or toolchain is not available

## Functional Test Scripts

**`node scripts/functional_tests [--config test/functional/config.js --config test/api_integration/config.js]`**

Runs all the functional tests: selenium tests and api integration tests. List configs with multiple `--config` arguments. Uses the [@kbn/test](../packages/kbn-test) library to run Elasticsearch and Kibana servers and tests against those servers, for multiple server+test setups. In particular, calls out to [`runTests()`](../packages/kbn-test/src/functional_tests/tasks.js). Can be run on a single config.

**`node scripts/functional_tests_server [--config test/functional/config.js]`**

Starts just the Elasticsearch and Kibana servers given a single config, i.e. via `--config test/functional/config.js` or `--config test/api_integration/config`. Allows the user to start just the servers with this script, and keep them running while running tests against these servers. The idea is that the same config file configures both Elasticsearch and Kibana servers. Uses the [`startServers()`](../packages/kbn-test/src/functional_tests/tasks.js#L52-L80) method from [@kbn/test](../packages/kbn-test) library.

Example. Start servers _and_ run tests, separately, but using the same config:

```sh
# Just the servers
node scripts/functional_tests_server --config path/to/config
```

In another terminal:

```sh
# Just the tests--against the running servers
node scripts/functional_test_runner --config path/to/config
```
