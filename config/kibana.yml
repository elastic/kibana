# Kibana is served by a back end server. This setting specifies the port to use.
# server.port: 5601

# This setting specifies the IP address of the back end server.
# server.host: "0.0.0.0"

# Enables you to specify a path to mount Kibana at if you are running behind a proxy. This setting
# cannot end in a slash.

# The Kibana server's name.  This is used for display purposes.
# server.name: "your-hostname"

# The URL of the Elasticsearch instance to use for all your queries.
# elasticsearch.url: "http://localhost:9200"

# When this setting’s value is true Kibana uses the hostname specified in the server.host
# setting. When the value of this setting is false, Kibana uses the hostname of the host
# that connects to this Kibana instance.

# The default application to load.
# kibana.defaultAppId: "discover"

# If your Elasticsearch is protected with basic authentication, these settings provide
# the username and password that the Kibana server uses to perform maintenance on the Kibana
# index at startup. Your Kibana users still need to authenticate with Elasticsearch, which
# is proxied through the Kibana server.

# Paths to the PEM-format SSL certificate and SSL key files, respectively. These
# files enable SSL for outgoing requests from the Kibana server to the browser.
# server.ssl.cert: /path/to/your/server.crt
# server.ssl.key: /path/to/your/server.key

# Optional settings that provide the paths to the PEM-format SSL certificate and key files.
# These files validate that your Elasticsearch backend uses the same key files.
# elasticsearch.ssl.cert: /path/to/your/client.crt
# elasticsearch.ssl.key: /path/to/your/client.key

# Optional setting that enables you to specify a path to the PEM file for the certificate
# authority for your Elasticsearch instance.
# elasticsearch.ssl.ca: /path/to/your/CA.pem

# To disregard the validity of SSL certificates, change this setting’s value to false.

# elasticsearch.shardTimeout: 0

# Time in milliseconds to wait for Elasticsearch at Kibana startup before retrying.
# elasticsearch.startupTimeout: 5000

# Specifies the path where Kibana creates the process ID file.
