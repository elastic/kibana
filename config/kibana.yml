# Specifies the address to which the Kibana server will bind. IP addresses and host names are both valid values.
# The default is 'localhost', which usually means remote machines will not be able to connect.
# To allow connections from remote users, set this parameter to a non-loopback address.
#server.host: "localhost"

# Enables you to specify a path to mount Kibana at if you are running behind a proxy. This only affects
# the URLs generated by Kibana, your proxy is expected to remove the basePath value before forwarding requests
# to Kibana. This setting cannot end in a slash.

# The URL of the Elasticsearch instance to use for all your queries.
#elasticsearch.url: "http://localhost:9200"

# When this setting’s value is true Kibana uses the hostname specified in the server.host
# setting. When the value of this setting is false, Kibana uses the hostname of the host
# that connects to this Kibana instance.

# If your Elasticsearch is protected with basic authentication, these settings provide

# Paths to the PEM-format SSL certificate and SSL key files, respectively. These
# files enable SSL for outgoing requests from the Kibana server to the browser.
#server.ssl.cert: /path/to/your/server.crt

# Optional settings that provide the paths to the PEM-format SSL certificate and key files.
# These files validate that your Elasticsearch backend uses the same key files.
#elasticsearch.ssl.cert: /path/to/your/client.crt

# Optional setting that enables you to specify a path to the PEM file for the certificate
# authority for your Elasticsearch instance.

# To disregard the validity of SSL certificates, change this setting’s value to false.

# Specifies the path where Kibana creates the process ID file.
