# as work on serverless picks up we will add config values to this file that
# define how Kibana will run in "serverless" mode. To start Kibana locally with
# this configuration, pass `--serverless` or run `yarn start-serverless`

# configuration is applied in the following order, later values override
#  1. kibana.yml
#  2. kibana.serverless.yml (when --serverless is passed)
#  3. kibana.dev.yml
#  4. kibana.serverless.dev.yml (when --serverless is passed)
