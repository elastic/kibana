/*

  Packages listed in this file are "bundled" with Kibana's built distributable, and are available
  on disk rather than only in the configured package registry service. This allows Kibana to install
  "stack-aligned" packages or those that are installed by default in an airgapped or offline environment.

  Packages will be fetched from https://epr-snapshot.elastic.co by default. This can be overridden
  via the `--epr-registry=production` command line argument when building Kibana. Fetching from the
  snapshot registry allows Kibana to bundle packages that have yet to be published to production in
  order to prepare build candidates for the next release.
