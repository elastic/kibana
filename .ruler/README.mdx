## Ruler

### For full documentation on Ruler, visit it's [docs](https://github.com/intellectronica/ruler). 
Ruler centralizes our AI agent instructions and MCP configuration within `.ruler`. Then when running `ruler apply` it will generate the respective files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, etc) for each tool using the centralized rules.

### Local Overrides
If you want to have your own local instructions which are not committed, add a `local` directory to `instructions`, and within `local` create a new `.md` file with any name. So the path is `.ruler/instructions/local/my_instructions.md`. Add any instructions you require and they will be appended when using `ruler apply`.
