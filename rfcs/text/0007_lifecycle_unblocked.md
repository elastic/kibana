# Summary

Prevent plugin lifecycle methods from blocking Kibana startup by making the
following changes:
1. Synchronous lifecycle methods 
2. Synchronous context provider functions
3. Core should not expose API's as observables

# Motivation
Plugin lifecycle methods and context provider functions are async
(promise-returning) functions. Core runs these functions in series and waits
for each plugin's lifecycle/context provider function to resolve before
calling the next. This allows plugins to depend on the API's returned from
other plugins.

With the current design, a single lifecycle method that blocks will block all
of Kibana from starting up. Similarly, a blocking context provider will block
all the handlers that depend on that context. Plugins (including legacy
plugins) rely heavily on this blocking behaviour to ensure that all conditions
required for their plugin's operation are met before their plugin is started
and exposes it's API's. This means a single plugin with a network error that
isn't retried or a dependency on an external host that is down, could block
all of Kibana from starting up.

We should make it impossible for a single plugin lifecycle function to stall
all of kibana.

# Detailed design

### 1. Synchronous lifecycle methods
Lifecycle methods are synchronous functions, they can perform async operations
but Core doesn't wait for these to complete. This guarantees that no plugin
lifecycle function can block other plugins or core from starting up [1]. 

Core will still expose special API's that are able block the setup lifecycle
such as registering Saved Object migrations, but this will be limited to
operations where the risk of blocking all of kibana starting up is limited.

### 2. Synchronous Context Provider functions
Making context provider functions synchronous guarantees that a context
handler will never be blocked by registered context providers. They can expose
async API's which could potentially have blocking behaviour. 

```ts
export type IContextProvider<
  THandler extends HandlerFunction<any>,
  TContextName extends keyof HandlerContextType<THandler>
> = (
  context: Partial<HandlerContextType<THandler>>,
  ...rest: HandlerParameters<THandler>
) =>
  | HandlerContextType<THandler>[TContextName];
```

### 3. Core should not expose API's as observables
All Core API's should be reactive: when internal state changes, their behaviour
should change accordingly. But, exposing these internal state changes as part
of the API contract leaks internal implementation details consumers can't do
anything useful with and don't care about.

For example: Core currently exposes `core.elasticsearch.adminClient$`, an
Observable which emits a pre-configured elasticsearch client every time there's
a configuration change. This includes changes to the logging configuration and
might in the future include updating the authentication headers sent to
elasticsearch https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/19829. As a plugin
author who wants to make search requests against elasticsearch I shouldn't
have to care about, react to, or keep track of, how many times the underlying
configuration has changed. I want to use the `callAsInternalUser` method and I
expect Core to use the most up to date configuration to send this request.

> Note: It would not be desirable for Core to dynamically load all

This does not mean we should remove all observables from Core's API's. When an
API consumer is interested in the *state changes itself* it absolutely makes
sense to expose this as an Observable. Good examples of this is exposing
plugin config as this is state that changes over time to which a plugin should
directly react to.

This is important in the context of synchronous lifecycle methods and context 
handlers since exposing convenient API's become very ugly:

*(3.1): exposing Observable-based API's through the route handler context:*
```ts
// Before: Using an async context provider
coreSetup.http.registerRouteHandlerContext(coreId, 'core', async (context, req) => {
  const adminClient = await coreSetup.elasticsearch.adminClient$.pipe(take(1)).toPromise();
  const dataClient = await coreSetup.elasticsearch.dataClient$.pipe(take(1)).toPromise();
  return {
    elasticsearch: {
      adminClient: adminClient.asScoped(req),
      dataClient: dataClient.asScoped(req),
    },
  };
});

// After: Using a synchronous context provider
coreSetup.http.registerRouteHandlerContext(coreId, 'core', async (context, req) => {
  return {
    elasticsearch: {
      // (3.1.1) We can expose a convenient API by doing a lot of work
      adminClient: () => {
        callAsInternalUser: async (...args) => {
          const adminClient = await coreSetup.elasticsearch.adminClient$.pipe(take(1)).toPromise();
          return adminClient.asScoped(req).callAsinternalUser(args);
        },
        callAsCurrentUser: async (...args) => {
          adminClient = await coreSetup.elasticsearch.adminClient$.pipe(take(1)).toPromise();
          return adminClient.asScoped(req).callAsCurrentUser(args);
        }
      },
      // (3.1.2) Or a lazy approach which perpetuates the problem to consumers:
      dataClient: async () => {
        const dataClient = await coreSetup.elasticsearch.dataClient$.pipe(take(1)).toPromise();
        return dataClient.asScoped(req);
      },
    },
  };
});
```

### 4. Complete example code
*(4.1) Doing async operations in a plugin's setup lifecycle*
```ts
export class Plugin {
  public setup(core: CoreSetup) {
    // Async setup is possible and any operations involving async API's
    // will still block until these API's are ready, (savedObjects find only 
    // resolves once the elasticsearch client has established a connection to 
    // the cluster). The difference is that these details are now internal to
    // the API.
    (async () => {
      const docs = await core.savedObjects.client.find({...});
      ...
      await core.savedObjects.client.update(...);
    })();
  }
}
```

*(4.2) Exposing an API from a plugin's setup lifecycle*
```ts
export class Plugin {
  constructor(private readonly initializerContext: PluginInitializerContext) {}
  private async initSavedConfig(core: CoreSetup) {
    // Note: pulling a config value here means our code isn't reactive to
    // changes, but this is equivalent to doing it in an async setup lifecycle.
    const config = await this.initializerContext.config
          .create<TypeOf<typeof ConfigSchema>>()
          .pipe(first())
          .toPromise();
    try {
      const savedConfig = await core.savedObjects.internalRepository.get({...});
      return Object.assign({}, config, savedConfig);
    } catch (e) {
      if (SavedObjectErrorHelpers.isNotFoundError(e)) {
        return await core.savedObjects.internalRepository.create(config, {...});
      }
    }
  }
  public setup(core: CoreSetup) {
    // savedConfigPromise resolves with the same kind of "setup state" that a
    // plugin would have constructed in an async setup lifecycle.
    const savedConfigPromise = initSavedConfig(core);
    return {
      ping: async () => {
        const savedConfig = await savedConfigPromise;
        if (config.allowPing === false || savedConfig.allowPing === false) {
          throw new Error('ping() has been disabled');
        }
        // Note: the elasticsearch client no longer exposes an adminClient$
        // observable, improving the ergonomics of consuming the API.
        return await core.elasticsearch.adminClient.callAsInternalUser('ping', ...);
      }
    };
  }
}
```

*(4.3) Exposing an observable free Elasticsearch API from the route context*
```ts
coreSetup.http.registerRouteHandlerContext(coreId, 'core', async (context, req) => {
  return {
    elasticsearch: {
      adminClient: coreSetup.elasticsearch.adminClient.asScoped(req),
      dataClient: coreSetup.elasticsearch.adminClient.asScoped(req),
    },
  };
});
```

### 5. Core should expose a status signal for Core services & plugins
Core should expose a global mechanism for core services and plugins to signal
their status. This is equivalent to the legacy status API
`kibana.Plugin.status` which allowed plugins to set their status to e.g. 'red'
or 'green'. The exact design of this API is outside of the scope of this RFC.

What is important, is that there is a global mechanism to signal status
changes which Core then makes visible to system administrators in the Kibana
logs and the `/status` HTTP API. Plugins should be able to inspect and
subscribe to status changes from any of their dependencies.

This will provide an obvious mechanism for plugins to signal that the
conditions which are required for this plugin to operate are not currently
present and manual intervention might be required. Status changes can happen
in both setup and start lifecycles e.g.:
 - [setup] a required remote host is down
 - [start] a remote host which was up during setup, started returning
   connection timeout errors.

# Drawbacks
Not being able to block on a lifecycle method means plugins can no longer be
certain that all setup is "complete" before they expose their API's or reach
the start lifecycle.

A plugin might want to poll an external host to ensure that the host is up in
its setup lifecycle before making network requests to this host in it's start
lifecycle. 

Even if Kibana was using a valid, but incorrect configuration for the remote
host, with synchronous lifecycles Kibana would still start up. Although the
status API and logs would indicate a problem, these might not be monitored
leading to the error only being discovered once someone tries to use it's
functionality. This is an acceptable drawback because it buys us isolation.
Some problems might go unnoticed, but no single plugin should affect the
availability of all other plugins.

In effect, the plugin is polling the world to construct a snapshot
of state which drives future behaviour. Modeling this with lifecycle functions
is insufficient since it assumes that any state constructed in the setup
lifecycle is static and won't and can't be changed in the future.

For example: a plugin's setup lifecycle might poll for the existence of a
custom Elasticsearch index and if it doesn't exist, create it. Should there be
an Elasticsearch restore which deletes the index, the plugin wouldn't be able
to gracefully recover by simply running it's setup lifecycle a second time.

The once-off nature of lifecycle methods are incompatible with the real-world
dynamic conditions under which plugins run. Not being able to block a
lifecycle method is, therefore, only a drawback when plugins are authored under
the false illusion of stability.

# Alternatives
## 1. Introduce a lifecycle/context provider timeout
Lifecycle methods and context providers would timeout after X seconds and any
API's they expose would not be available if the timeout had been reached.

Drawbacks:
1. A blocking setup lifecycle makes it easy for plugin authors to fall into
   the trap of assuming that their plugin's behaviour can continue to operate
   based on the snapshot of conditions present during setup.

2. For lifecycle methods: there would be no way to recover from a timeout,
   once a timeout had been reached the API will remain unavailable.

   Context providers have the benefit of being re-created for each handler
   call, so a single timeout would not permanently disable the API.

3. Plugins have less control over their behaviour. When an upstream server
   becomes unavailable, a plugin might prefer to keep retrying the request
   indefinitely or only timeout after more than X seconds. It also isn't able
   to expose detailed error information to downstream consumers such as
   specifying which host or service is unavailable.

4. (minor) Introduces an additional failure condition that needs to be handled.
   Consumers should handle the API not being available in setup, as well as,
   error responses from the API itself. Since remote hosts like Elasticsearch
   could go down even after a successful setup, this effectively means API
   consumers have to handle the same error condition in two places.

## 2. Treat anything that blocks Kibana from starting up as a bug
Keep the existing New Platform blocking behaviour, but through strong
conventions and developer awareness minimize the risk of plugins blocking
Kibana's startup indefinetely. By logging detailed diagnostic info on any
plugins that appear to be blocking startup, we can aid system administrators
to recover a blocked Kibana.

A parallel can be drawn between Kibana's async plugin initialization and the TC39
proposal for [top-level await](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-top-level-await).
> enables modules to act as big async functions: With top-level await,
> ECMAScript Modules (ESM) can await resources, causing other modules who
> import them to wait before they start evaluating their body

They believe the benefits outweigh the risk of modules blocking loading since:
 - [developer education should result in correct usage](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-top-level-await#will-top-level-await-cause-developers-to-make-their-code-block-longer-than-it-should)
 - [there are existing unavoidable ways in which modules could block loading such as infinite loops or recursion](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-top-level-await#does-top-level-await-increase-the-risk-of-deadlocks)


Drawbacks:
1. A blocking setup lifecycle makes it easy for plugin authors to fall into
   the trap of assuming that their plugin's behaviour can continue to operate
   based on the snapshot of conditions present during setup.
2. This opens up the potential for a bug in Elastic or third-party plugins to
   effectively "break" kibana. Instead of a single plugin being disabled all
   of kibana would be down requiring manual intervention by a system
   administrator. 

# Adoption strategy
Although the eventual goal is to have sync-only lifecycles / providers, we
will start by deprecating async behaviour and implementing a 30s timeout as
per alternative (1). This will immediately lower the impact of plugin bugs
while at the same time enabling a more incremental rollout and the flexibility
to discover use cases that would require adopting Core API's to support sync
lifecycles / providers.

Adoption and implementation should be handled as follows:
 - Adopt Core API’s to make sync lifecycles easier (3)
 - Update migration guide and other documentation examples.
 - Deprecate async lifecycles / context providers with a warning. Add a
   timeout of 30s after which a plugin and it's dependencies will be disabled.
 - Refactor existing plugin lifecycles which are easily converted to sync
 - Future: remove async timeout lifecycles / context providers

functions and will be impacted:

# How we teach this

Async Plugin lifecycle methods and async context provider functions have been
deprecated. In the future all lifecycle methods will by sync only. Plugins
should treat the setup lifecycle as a place in time to register functionality
with core or other plugins' API's and not as a mechanism to kick off and wait
for any initialization that's required for the plugin to be able to run.

# Unresolved questions
1. ~~Are the drawbacks worth the benefits or can we live with Kibana potentially
being blocked for the sake of convenient async lifecycle stages?~~

2. Should core provide conventions or patterns for plugins to construct a
   snapshot of state and reactively updating this state and the behaviour it
   drives as the state of the world changes?

3. Do plugins ever need to read config values and pass these as parameters to
   Core API’s? If so we would have to expose synchronous config values to
   support sync lifecycles.

# Footnotes
[1] Synchronous lifecycles can still be blocked by e.g. an infine for loop,
but this would always be unintentional behaviour in contrast to intentional
async behaviour like blocking until an external service becomes available.
