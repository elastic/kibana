## Embeddable Explorer

This is a functionally tested set of Embeddable API examples.

To get started, run 

```
> yarn es snapshot
```

in one terminal, and in another:

```
> yarn start --plugin-path test/plugin_functional/plugins/kbn_tp_embeddable_explorer/
```

Then open up Kibana, navigate to the embeddable explorer app, and have fun!
