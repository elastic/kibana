# Plugin Functional Tests

This folder contains plugin functional tests, i.e. functional tests that should be executed
against a Kibana instance with specific test plugins available.

To add a plugin to the instance, just place the plugin folder in the `plugins`
directory.

Add new test suites into the `test_suites` folder and reference them from the
`config.js` file. These test suites work the same as regular functional test
except that they are executed against a Kibana with all plugins (from the
`plugins` directory) installed.

## Run the test

To run these tests during development you can use the following commands:

```
# Start the test server (can continue running)
node scripts/functional_tests_server.js --config test/plugin_functional/config.js
# Start a test run
node scripts/functional_test_runner.js --config test/plugin_functional/config.js
```
