################### APM Server Configuration Example #########################

############################# APM Server ######################################

apm-server:

  # Defines the host and port the server is listening on
  host: "localhost:8200"

  # Authorization token to be checked. If a token is set here the agents must
  # send their token in the following format: Authorization: Bearer <secret-token>
  #secret_token:

#==================== Elasticsearch template setting ==========================
setup.template.settings:
  index.number_of_shards: 1
  index.codec: best_compression

#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging


#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag or the `setup` command.
# setup.dashboards.enabled: false
#setup.dashboards.enabled: true

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:

#============================== Kibana =====================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
#setup.kibana:

  # Kibana Host
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601
  #host: "localhost:5601"


  # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
  #protocol: "http"
  #username: "elastic"
  #password: "changeit"
  #
  #                 # Optional HTTP Path
  #                   #path: ""
  #
  #                     # Use SSL settings for HTTPS. Default is true.
  #ssl.enabled: false

  # Configure SSL verification mode. If `none` is configured, all server hosts
  # and certificates will be accepted. In this mode, SSL based connections are
  # susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing. Default is
  # `full`.
  # ssl.verification_mode: "none"
  #
  # List of supported/valid TLS versions. By default all TLS versions 1.0 up to
  # 1.2 are enabled.
  #ssl.supported_protocols: [TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2]

  # ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/apm-server/ca.crt"]
  # ssl.certificate: /etc/apm-server/elasticsearch.crt
  # ssl.key: /etc/apm-server/elasticsearch.key

  # SSL configuration. By default is off.
  #                                           # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
  #                                             #ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]
  #
  #                                               # Certificate for SSL client authentication

  #
  #                                                       # Optional passphrase for decrypting the Certificate Key.
  #                                                         #ssl.key_passphrase: ''
  #
  #                                                           # Configure cipher suites to be used for SSL connections

  #
  #                                                               # Configure curve types for ECDHE based cipher suites
  #                                                                 #ssl.curve_types: []
  #
  #

#============================= Elastic Cloud ==================================

# These settings simplify using apm-server with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).

# The cloud.id setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.hosts` and
# `setup.kibana.host` options.
# You can find the `cloud.id` in the Elastic Cloud web UI.
#cloud.id:

# The cloud.auth setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.username` and
# `output.elasticsearch.password` settings. The format is `<user>:<pass>`.
#cloud.auth:

#================================ Outputs =====================================

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

  # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
  protocol: "http"
  username: "elastic"
  password: "changeit"

  ssl.enabled: false
  # ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/apm-server/ca.crt"]
  # ssl.certificate: /etc/apm-server/elasticsearch.crt
  # ssl.key: /etc/apm-server/elasticsearch.key


#----------------------------- Logstash output --------------------------------
#output.logstash:
  # The Logstash hosts
  #hosts: ["localhost:5044"]

  # Optional SSL. By default is off.
  # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
  #ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

  # Certificate for SSL client authentication
  #ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

  # Client Certificate Key
  #ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

#================================ Logging =====================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publish", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]
