  </h3>
  <p>
    It looks like your Elasticsearch cluster has the <code>rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index</code> setting set to <code>false</code>, which prevents Kibana from making search requests. We use this ability to send a single request to Elasticsearch that searches multiple indexes so that when there are many panels on a dashboard they will load quickly and uniformly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, until this issue is fixed you won't be able to use certain apps in Kibana, like Discover, Visualize and Dashboard.
  </p>

  <h3>Ok, how do I fix this?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove <code>rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index: false</code> from your Elasticsearch config file.</li>
    <li>Restart Elasticsearch.</li>
    <li>Use the browser's back button to return to what you were doing.</li>
  </ol>
