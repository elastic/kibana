    Your url {{controller.over ? 'met' : 'exceeded'}} the configured limit of {{controller.limit}} characters.
  </div>

  <h3>Your URL</h3>
  <pre>{{controller.url}}</pre>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Saved objects can sometimes persist some unexpectedly large values that get put into the url when they load. You may be able to edit these saved objects in the <a href="#/settings/objects">"objects" section of the settings app</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sometimes dashboards with too many panels can cause the state
      to grow in length very quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Maybe you could temporarily raise the <code>uri:limit</code> setting in the <a href="#/settings/advanced">advanced settings</a> app.
    </li>
  </ul>
