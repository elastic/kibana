/**
 * The keyboardMove directive can be attached to elements, that can receive keydown events.
 * It will call the passed callback function and pass the direction in which an
 * arrow key was pressed to the callback (as the argument with the name `direction`).
 * The passed value will be one of `Direction.up` or `Direction.down`, which can be
 * imported to compare against those values. The directive will also make sure, that
 * the pressed button will get the focus back (e.g. if it was lost due to a ng-repeat
 * reordering).
 *
 * Usage example:
 *
 * <button keyboard-move="onMoved(direction)">...</button>
 *
 * import { Direction } from './keyboard_move';
 * function onMoved(dir) {
 *   if (dir === Direction.up) {
 *     // moved up
 *   } else if (dir === Direction.down) {
 *     // moved down
 *   }
 * }
