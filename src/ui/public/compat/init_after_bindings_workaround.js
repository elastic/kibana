/**
 *  WHAT NEEDS THIS WORKAROUND?
 *  ===========================
 *  Any directive that meets all of the following criteria:
 *   - uses isolate scope bindings
 *   - sets `bindToController: true`
 *   - synchronously accesses the bound values in the controller constructor
 *
 *
 *
 *  HOW DO I GET RID OF IT?
 *  =======================
 *  The quick band-aid solution:
 *    Wrap your constructor logic so it doesn't access bound values
 *    synchronously. This can have subtle bugs which is why I didn't
 *    just wrap all of the offenders in $timeout() and made this
 *    workaround instead.
 *
 *  The more complete solution:
 *    Use the new component lifecycle methods, like `$onInit()`, to access
 *    bindings immediately after the constructor is called, which shouldn't
 *    have any observable effect outside of the constructor.
 *
 *    NOTE: `$onInit()` is not dependency injected, if you need controller specific
 *      dependencies like `$scope` then you're probably using watchers and should
 *      take a look at the new one-way data flow facitilies available to
 *      directives/components:
 *
 *      https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component#component-based-application-architecture
 *
