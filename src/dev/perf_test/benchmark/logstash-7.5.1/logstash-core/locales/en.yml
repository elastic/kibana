        # them in an 80-character terminal
        config: |+
          Load the logstash config from a specific file
          or directory.  If a directory is given, all
          files in that directory will be concatenated
          in lexicographical order and then parsed as a
          single config file. You can also specify
          wildcards (globs) and any matched files will
          be loaded in the order described above.
        config-string: |+
          Use the given string as the configuration
          data. Same syntax as the config file. If no
          input is specified, then the following is
          used as the default input:
          "%{default_input}"
          and if no output is specified, then the
          following is used as the default output:
          "%{default_output}"
          If you wish to use both defaults, please use
          the empty string for the '-e' flag.
        field-reference-parser: |+
          (DEPRECATED) This option is no longer
          configurable.

          Use the given MODE when parsing field
          references.

          The field reference parser is used to expand
          field references in your pipeline configs,
          and has become more strict to better handle
          ambiguous- and illegal-syntax inputs.

          The only available MODE is:
           - `STRICT`: parse in a strict manner; when
             given ambiguous- or illegal-syntax input,
             raises a runtime exception that should
             be handled by the calling plugin.

        modules: |+
          Load Logstash modules.
          Modules can be defined using multiple instances
          '--modules module1 --modules module2',
             or comma-separated syntax
          '--modules=module1,module2'
          Cannot be used in conjunction with '-e' or '-f'
          Use of '--modules' will override modules declared
          in the 'logstash.yml' file.
        modules_variable: |+
          Load variables for module template.
          Multiple instances of '-M' or
          '--modules.variable' are supported.
          Ignored if '--modules' flag is not used.
          Should be in the format of
          '-M "MODULE_NAME.var.PLUGIN_TYPE.PLUGIN_NAME.VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE"'
          as in
          '-M "example.var.filter.mutate.fieldname=fieldvalue"'
        modules_setup: |+
          Load index template into Elasticsearch, and saved searches, 
          index-pattern, visualizations, and dashboards into Kibana when
          running modules.
        cloud_id: |+
          Sets the elasticsearch and kibana host settings for
          module connections in Elastic Cloud.
          Your Elastic Cloud User interface or the Cloud support
          team should provide this.
          Add an optional label prefix '<label>:' to help you
          identify multiple cloud.ids.
          e.g. 'staging:dXMtZWFzdC0xLmF3cy5mb3VuZC5pbyRub3RhcmVhbCRpZGVudGlmaWVy'
        cloud_auth: |+
          Sets the elasticsearch and kibana username and password
          for module connections in Elastic Cloud
          e.g. 'username:<password>'
        configtest: |+
          Check configuration for valid syntax and then exit.
        http_host: Web API binding host
        http_port: Web API http port
        pipeline-id: |+
          Sets the ID of the pipeline.
        pipeline-workers: |+

          for the next event.
        path_settings: |+
          Directory containing logstash.yml file. This can also be
          set through the LS_SETTINGS_DIR environment variable.
        path_logs: |+
            Directory to Write Logstash internal logs to.
        auto_reload: |+
          Monitor configuration changes and reload
          whenever it is changed.
          NOTE: use SIGHUP to manually reload the config
        reload_interval: |+
          How frequently to poll the configuration location
          for changes, in seconds.
        log: |+
          Write logstash internal logs to the given
          file. Without this flag, logstash will emit
          logs to standard output.
        verbosity: |+
          Increase verbosity of logstash internal logs.
          Specifying once will show 'informational'
          logs. Specifying twice will show 'debug'
          logs. This flag is deprecated. You should use
          --log-level=info or --log-level=debug instead.
        version: |+
          Emit the version of logstash and its friends,
          then exit.
        datapath: |+
          This should point to a writable directory. Logstash
          will use this directory whenever it needs to store
          data. Plugins will also have access to this path.
        pluginpath: |+
          A path of where to find plugins. This flag
          can be given multiple times to include
          multiple paths. Plugins are expected to be
          in a specific directory hierarchy:
          'PATH/logstash/TYPE/NAME.rb' where TYPE is
          'inputs' 'filters', 'outputs' or 'codecs'
          and NAME is the name of the plugin.
        log_level: |+
          Set the log level for logstash. Possible values are:

            - info
            - debug
            - trace
        unsafe_shutdown: |+
          Force logstash to exit during shutdown even
          if there are still inflight events in memory.
          By default, logstash will refuse to quit until all
          received events have been pushed to the outputs.
        rubyshell: |+
          Drop to shell instead of running as normal.
          Valid shells are "irb" and "pry"
        name: |+
          Specify the name of this logstash instance, if no value is given
          it will default to the current hostname.
        config_debug: |+
          Print the compiled config ruby code out as a debug log (you must also have --log.level=debug enabled).
          WARNING: This will include any 'password' options passed to plugin configs as plaintext, and may result
          in plaintext passwords appearing in your logs!
        log_format: |+
          Specify if Logstash should write its own logs in JSON form (one
          event per line) or in plain text (using Ruby's Object#inspect)
        debug: |+
          Set the log level to debug.
          DEPRECATED: use --log.level=debug instead.
        verbose: |+

          DEPRECATED: use --log.level=info instead.
