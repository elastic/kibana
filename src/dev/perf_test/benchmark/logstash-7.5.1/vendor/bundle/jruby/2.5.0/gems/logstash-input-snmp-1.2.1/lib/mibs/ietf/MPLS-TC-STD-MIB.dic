[RFC3031],  [RFC3032], [RFC3034], [RFC3035] and
[RFC3471].

The label contents are specific to the label being
represented, such as:

* The label carried in an MPLS shim header
  (for LDP this is the Generic Label) is a 20-bit
  number represented by 4 octets.  Bits 0-19 contain
  a label or a reserved label value.  Bits 20-31
  MUST be zero.

  The following is quoted directly from [RFC3032].
  There are several reserved label values:

     i. A value of 0 represents the
        'IPv4 Explicit NULL Label'.  This label
        value is only legal at the bottom of the
        label stack.  It indicates that the label
        stack must be popped, and the forwarding
        of the packet must then be based on the



        IPv4 header.

    ii. A value of 1 represents the
        'Router Alert Label'.  This label value is
        legal anywhere in the label stack except at
        the bottom.  When a received packet
        contains this label value at the top of
        the label stack, it is delivered to a
        local software module for processing.
        The actual forwarding of the packet
        is determined by the label beneath it
        in the stack.  However, if the packet is
        forwarded further, the Router Alert Label
        should be pushed back onto the label stack
        before forwarding.  The use of this label
        is analogous to the use of the
        'Router Alert Option' in IP packets
        [RFC2113].  Since this label
        cannot occur at the bottom of the stack,
        it is not associated with a
        particular network layer protocol.

   iii. A value of 2 represents the
        'IPv6 Explicit NULL Label'.  This label
        value is only legal at the bottom of the
        label stack.  It indicates that the label
        stack must be popped, and the forwarding
        of the packet must then be based on the
        IPv6 header.

    iv. A value of 3 represents the
        'Implicit NULL Label'.
        This is a label that an LSR may assign and
        distribute, but which never actually
        appears in the encapsulation.  When an
        LSR would otherwise replace the label
        at the top of the stack with a new label,
        but the new label is 'Implicit NULL',
        the LSR will pop the stack instead of
        doing the replacement.  Although
        this value may never appear in the
        encapsulation, it needs to be specified in
        the Label Distribution Protocol, so a value
        is reserved.

     v. Values 4-15 are reserved.

* The frame relay label can be either 10-bits or



  23-bits depending on the DLCI field size and the
  upper 22-bits or upper 9-bits must be zero,
  respectively.

* For an ATM label the lower 16-bits represents the
  VCI, the next 12-bits represents the VPI and the
  remaining bits MUST be zero.

* The Generalized-MPLS (GMPLS) label contains a
  value greater than 2^24-1 and used in GMPLS
  as defined in [RFC3471].""",

ipv4(1)      An IPv4 network address as defined by
             the InetAddressIPv4 TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
             [RFC3291].

ipv6(2)      A global IPv6 address as defined by

Each definition of a concrete TeHopAddressType
value must be accompanied by a definition
of a TEXTUAL-CONVENTION for use with that
TeHopAddress.

To support future extensions, the TeHopAddressType
TEXTUAL-CONVENTION SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in
object type definitions.  It MAY be sub-typed in
compliance statements in order to require only a
subset of these address types for a compliant
implementation.

Implementations must ensure that TeHopAddressType

An inconsistentValue error must be generated
if an attempt to change a TeHopAddressType
object would, for example, lead to an
undefined TeHopAddress value that is
