                """An octet string containing information typically in
human-readable form.

To facilitate internationalization, this
information is represented by using the ISO/IEC
IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
string using the UTF-8 transformation format
described in RFC 3629.

As additional code points are added by
amendments to the 10646 standard from time
to time, implementations must be prepared to
encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
0x10FFFF.  Byte sequences that do not
correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
code point or that are outside this range are
prohibited.

The use of control codes should be avoided.

When it is necessary to represent a newline,
the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

For code points not directly supported by user
interface hardware or software, an alternative
means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
may be provided.

For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
US-ASCII encoding.

UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
single character/code point; thus, the length
of this object in octets may be different from
the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
size constraints refer to the number of encoded
octets, not the number of characters represented
by an encoding.

Note that when this TC is used for an object
used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by



RFC 3416.

Note that the size of PmUTF8String object is
measured in octets, not characters.""",

an element is a member of a set of elements upon which an
action is to be performed.  If a policy is ready and the

will match the condition and will have the associated

system.

The Element Type Registration table allows the manager to
learn what element types are being managed by the system and
to register new types, if necessary.  An element type is
registered by providing the OID of an SNMP object (i.e.,
without the instance).  Each SNMP instance that exists under
that object is a distinct element.  The index of the element is
the index part of the discovered OID.  This index will be
supplied to policy conditions and actions so that this code
can inspect and configure the element.

For example, this table might contain the following entries.
The first three are agent-installed, and the 4th was
downloaded by a management station:

OIDPrefix        MaxLatency  Description               StorageType
ifEntry          100 mS      interfaces - builtin      readOnly
0.0              100 mS      system element - builtin  readOnly
frCircuitEntry   100 mS      FR Circuits - builtin     readOnly
hrSWRunEntry     60 sec      Running Processes         volatile




Note that agents may automatically configure elements in this
table for frequently used element types (interfaces, circuits,
etc.).  In particular, it may configure elements for whom
discovery is optimized in one or both of the following ways:

1. The agent may discover elements by scanning internal data
   structures as opposed to issuing local SNMP requests.  It is
   possible to recreate the exact semantics described in this
   table even if local SNMP requests are not issued.

2. The agent may receive asynchronous notification of new
   elements (for example, 'card inserted') and use that
   information to instantly create elements rather than
   through polling.  A similar feature might be available for
   the deletion of elements.

Note that the disposition of agent-installed entries is
described by the pmPolicyStorageType object.""",

elements of this type will be found.  Every row in the

period of time that it remains in the table.  The agent will
then execute policy conditions and actions as appropriate on
each of these elements.

This object identifier value is specified down to the 'entry'
component (e.g., ifEntry) of the identifier.

The index of each discovered row will be passed to each
invocation of the policy condition and policy action.

The actual mechanism by which instances are discovered is
implementation dependent.  Periodic walks of the table to
discover the rows in the table is one such mechanism.  This
mechanism has the advantage that it can be performed by an
agent with no knowledge of the names, syntax, or semantics
of the MIB objects in the table.  This mechanism also serves as
the reference design.  Other implementation-dependent
mechanisms may be implemented that are more efficient (perhaps
because they are hard coded) or that don't require polling.
These mechanisms must discover the same elements as would the
table-walking reference design.

This object can contain a OBJECT IDENTIFIER, '0.0'.
'0.0' represents the single instance of the system
itself and provides an execution context for policies to
operate on the 'system element' and on MIB objects
modeled as scalars.  For example, '0.0' gives an execution
context for policy-based selection of the operating system
code version (likely modeled as a scalar MIB object).  The
element type '0.0' always exists; as a consequence, no actual
discovery will take place, and the pmElementTypeRegMaxLatency
object will have no effect for the '0.0' element
type.  However, if the '0.0' element type is not registered in
the table, policies will not be executed on the '0.0' element.

When a policy is invoked on behalf of a '0.0' entry in this
table, the element name will be '0.0', and there is no index
of 'this element' (in other words, it has zero length).

their associations.

It is the responsibility of the agent to keep track of any
re-indexing of the underlying SNMP elements and to continue to
associate role strings with the element with which they were
initially configured.

Policy MIB agents that have elements in multiple local SNMP
contexts have to allow some roles to be assigned to elements
in particular contexts.  This is particularly true when some
elements have the same names in different contexts and the
context is required to disambiguate them.  In those situations,
a value for the pmRoleContextName may be provided.  When a
pmRoleContextName value is not provided, the assignment is to
the element in the default context.

Policy MIB agents that discover elements on other systems and
execute policies on their behalf need to have access to role
information for these remote elements.  In such situations,
role assignments for other systems can be stored in this table
by providing values for the pmRoleContextEngineID parameters.

1) The OID of a MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro that represents the

MIB Module.  For example, an agent that implements the OSPF
MIB Module at the highest level of compliance would have the
value of '1.3.6.1.2.1.14.15.2' in the pmCapabilitiesType
object.  For software that realizes standard MIB
Modules that do not have compliance statements, the base OID
of the MIB Module should be used instead.  If the OSPF MIB
Module had not been created with a compliance statement, then
the correct value of the pmCapabilitiesType would be
'1.3.6.1.2.1.14'.  In the cases where multiple compliance
statements in a MIB Module are supported by the agent, and
where one compliance statement does not by definition include
the other, each of the compliance OIDs would have entries in
this table.




MIB Documents can contain more than one MIB Module.  In the
case of OSPF, there is a second MIB Module
that describes notifications for the OSPF Version 2 Protocol.
If the agent also realizes these functions, an entry will
also exist for those capabilities in this table.

2) Vendors should install OIDs in this table that represent
vendor-specific capabilities.  These capabilities can be
expressed just as those described above for MIB Modules on
the standards track.  In addition, vendors may install any
OID they desire from their registered branch.  The OIDs may be
at any level of granularity, from the root of their entire
branch to an instance of a single OID.  There is no
restriction on the number of registrations they may make,
though care should be taken to avoid unnecessary entries.

3) OIDs that represent one capability or a collection of
capabilities that could be any collection of MIB Objects or
hardware or software functions may be created in working
groups and registered in a MIB Module.  Other entities (e.g.,
vendors) may also make registrations.  Software will register
these standard capability OIDs, as well as vendor specific
OIDs.

If the OID for a known capability is not present in the
table, then it should be assumed that the capability is not
implemented.

This format is expressed as a string representing the
starting date and time, in which the character 'T' indicates
the beginning of the time portion, followed by the solidus
character, '/', followed by a similar string representing an
end date and time.  The start of the period MUST be before the
end of the period.  Date-Time values are expressed as
substrings of the form 'yyyymmddThhmmss'.  For example:

    20000101T080000/20000131T130000

The 'Date with UTC time' format defined in RFC 2445 in which
the Date-Time string ends with the character 'Z' is not
allowed.

This 'period-explicit' format is also extended to allow two
special cases in which one of the Date-Time strings is
replaced with a special string defined in RFC 2445:

1. If the first Date-Time value is replaced with the string
   'THISANDPRIOR', then the value indicates that the schedule
   is active at any time prior to the Date-Time that appears
   after the '/'.

2. If the second Date-Time is replaced with the string
   'THISANDFUTURE', then the value indicates that the schedule
   is active at any time after the Date-Time that appears
   before the '/'.




Note that although RFC 2445 defines these two strings, they are
not specified for use in the 'period-explicit' format.  The use
of these strings represents an extension to the
'period-explicit' format.""",

day of a month.  The last day in the month can therefore
be specified by setting the bit r1(31), and r31(61) means
the first day of a month with 31 days.

pmSchedTimePeriod object, the value of this object specifies
the range of times in a day when the schedule is active.

This value is stored in a format based on the RFC 2445 format
for 'time': The character 'T' followed by a 'time' string,
followed by the solidus character, '/', followed by the
character 'T', followed by a second time string.  The first time
indicates the beginning of the range, and the second time
indicates the end.  Thus, this value takes the following
form:

    'Thhmmss/Thhmmss'.

The second substring always identifies a later time than the
first substring.  To allow for ranges that span midnight,
however, the value of the second string may be smaller than
the value of the first substring.  Thus, 'T080000/T210000'
identifies the range from 0800 until 2100, whereas
'T210000/T080000' identifies the range from 2100 until 0800 of
the following day.

When a range spans midnight, by definition it includes parts
of two successive days.  When one of these days is also
selected by either the MonthOfYearMask, DayOfMonthMask, and/or
DayOfWeekMask, but the other day is not, then the policy is
active only during the portion of the range that falls on the
selected day.  For example, if the range extends from 2100



until 0800, and the day of week mask selects Monday and
Tuesday, then the policy is active during the following three
intervals:

    From midnight Sunday until 0800 Monday
    From 2100 Monday until 0800 Tuesday
    From 2100 Tuesday until 23:59:59 Tuesday

 Setting this value to 'T000000/T235959' will cause the
