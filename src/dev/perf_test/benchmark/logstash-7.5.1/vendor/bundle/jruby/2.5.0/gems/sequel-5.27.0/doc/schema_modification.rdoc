= Schema modification methods

Here's a brief description of the most common schema modification methods:

== +create_table+

+create_table+ is the most common schema modification method, and it's used for adding new tables
to the database.  You provide it with the name of the table as a symbol, as well a block:

  create_table(:artists) do
    primary_key :id
    String :name
  end

Note that if you want a primary key for the table, you need to specify it, Sequel does not create one
by default.

=== Column types

Most method calls inside the create_table block will create columns, since +method_missing+ calls +column+.
Columns are generally created by specifying the column type as the method
name, followed by the column name symbol to use, and after that any options that should be used.
If the method is a ruby class name that Sequel recognizes, Sequel will transform it into the appropriate
type for the given database.  So while you specified +String+, Sequel will actually use +varchar+ or
+text+ depending on the underlying database.  Here's a list of all ruby classes that Sequel will
convert to database types:

  create_table(:columns_types) do     # common database type used
    Integer :a0                       # integer
    String :a1                        # varchar(255)
    String :a2, size: 50              # varchar(50)
    String :a3, fixed: true           # char(255)
    String :a4, fixed: true, size: 50 # char(50)
    String :a5, text: true            # text
    File :b                           # blob
    Fixnum :c                         # integer
    Bignum :d                         # bigint
    Float :e                          # double precision
    BigDecimal :f                     # numeric
    BigDecimal :f2, size: 10          # numeric(10)
    BigDecimal :f3, size: [10, 2]     # numeric(10, 2)
    Date :g                           # date
    DateTime :h                       # timestamp
    Time :i                           # timestamp
    Time :i2, only_time: true         # time
    Numeric :j                        # numeric
    TrueClass :k                      # boolean
    FalseClass :l                     # boolean
  end

Note that in addition to the ruby class name, Sequel also pays attention to the column options when
determining which database type to use.  Also note that for boolean columns, you can use either
TrueClass or FalseClass, they are treated the same way (ruby doesn't have a Boolean class).

Also note that this conversion is only done if you use a supported ruby class name.  In all other
cases, Sequel uses the type specified verbatim:

  create_table(:columns_types) do  # database type used
    string :a1                     # string
    datetime :a2                   # datetime
    blob :a3                       # blob
    inet :a4                       # inet
  end

In addition to specifying the types as methods, you can use the +column+ method and specify the types
as the second argument, either as ruby classes, symbols, or strings:

  create_table(:columns_types) do  # database type used
    column :a1, :string            # string
    column :a2, String             # varchar(255)
    column :a3, 'string'           # string
    column :a4, :datetime          # datetime
    column :a5, DateTime           # timestamp
    column :a6, 'timestamp(6)'     # timestamp(6)
  end

If you use a ruby class as the type, Sequel will try to guess the appropriate type name for the
database you are using.  If a symbol or string is used as the type, it is used verbatim as the type
name in SQL, with the exception of :Bignum.  Using the symbol :Bignum as a type will use the
appropriate 64-bit integer type for the database you are using.

=== Column options

When using the type name as method, the third argument is an options hash, and when using the +column+
method, the fourth argument is the options hash.  The following options are supported:

:default :: The default value for the column.
:index :: Create an index on this column. If given a hash, use the hash as the
          options for the index.
:null :: Mark the column as allowing NULL values (if true),
         or not allowing NULL values (if false).  If unspecified, will default
         to whatever the database default is (usually true).
:primary_key :: Mark this column as the primary key.  This is used instead of the
                primary key method if you want a non-autoincrementing primary key.
:primary_key_constraint_name :: The name to give the primary key constraint.
:type :: Overrides the type given as the method name or a separate argument.
         Not usually used by +column+ itself, but often by other methods such
         as +primary_key+ or +foreign_key+.
:unique :: Mark the column as unique, generally has the same effect as
           creating a unique index on the column.
:unique_constraint_name :: The name to give the unique constraint.

=== Other methods

In addition to the +column+ method and other methods that create columns, there are other methods that can be used:

==== +primary_key+

You've seen this one used already.  It's used to create an autoincrementing integer primary key column.

  create_table(:a0){primary_key :id}

If you want an autoincrementing 64-bit integer:

  create_table(:a0){primary_key :id, type: :Bignum}

If you want to create a primary key column that doesn't use an autoincrementing integer, you should
not use this method.  Instead, you should use the :primary_key option to the +column+ method or type
method:

  create_table(:a1){Integer :id, primary_key: true} # Non autoincrementing integer primary key
  create_table(:a2){String :name, primary_key: true} # varchar(255) primary key

If you want to create a composite primary key, you should call the +primary_key+ method with an
array of column symbols.  You can provide a specific name to use for the primary key constraint
via the :name option:

  create_table(:items) do
    Integer :group_id
    Integer :position
    primary_key [:group_id, :position], name: :items_pk
  end

If provided with an array, +primary_key+ does not create a column, it just sets up the primary key constraint.

==== +foreign_key+

+foreign_key+ is used to create a foreign key column that references a column in another table (or the same table).
It takes the column name as the first argument, the table it references as the second argument, and an options hash
as its third argument.  A simple example is:

  create_table(:albums) do
    primary_key :id
    foreign_key :artist_id, :artists
    String :name
  end

+foreign_key+ accepts the same options as +column+.  For example, to have a unique foreign key with varchar(16) type:

  foreign_key :column_name, :table, unique: true, type: 'varchar(16)'

+foreign_key+ also accepts some specific options:

:deferrable :: Makes the foreign key constraint checks deferrable, so they aren't checked
               until the end of the transaction.
:foreign_key_constraint_name :: The name to give the foreign key constraint.
:key :: The column in the associated table
        that this column references.  Unnecessary if this column
        references the primary key of the associated table, at least
        on most databases.
:on_delete :: Specify the behavior of this foreign key column when the row with the primary key
              it references is deleted, can be :restrict, :cascade, :set_null, or :set_default.
              You can also use a string, which is used literally.
:on_update :: Specify the behavior of this foreign key column when the row with the primary key
              it references modifies the value of the primary key.  Takes the same options as
              :on_delete.

Like +primary_key+, if you provide +foreign_key+ with an array of symbols, it will not create a
column, but create a foreign key constraint:

  create_table(:artists) do
    String :name
    String :location
    primary_key [:name, :location]
  end
  create_table(:albums) do
    String :artist_name
    String :artist_location
    String :name
    foreign_key [:artist_name, :artist_location], :artists
  end

When using an array of symbols, you can also provide a :name option to name the constraint:

  create_table(:albums) do
    String :artist_name
    String :artist_location
    String :name
    foreign_key [:artist_name, :artist_location], :artists, name: 'albums_artist_name_location_fkey'
  end

If you want to add a foreign key for a single column with a named constraint, you must use
the array form with a single symbol:

  create_table(:albums) do
    primary_key :id
    Integer :artist_id
    String :name
    foreign_key [:artist_id], :artists, name: 'albums_artist_id_fkey'
  end

==== +index+

+index+ creates indexes on the table.  For single columns, calling index is the same as using the
<tt>:index</tt> option when creating the column:

  create_table(:a){Integer :id, index: true}
  # Same as:
  create_table(:a) do
    Integer :id
    index :id
  end

  create_table(:a){Integer :id, index: {unique: true}}
  # Same as:
  create_table(:a) do
    Integer :id
    index :id, unique: true
  end

Similar to the +primary_key+ and +foreign_key+ methods, calling +index+ with an array of symbols
will create a multiple column index:

  create_table(:albums) do
    primary_key :id
    foreign_key :artist_id, :artists
    Integer :position
    index [:artist_id, :position]
  end

The +index+ method also accepts some options:

:name :: The name of the index (generated based on the table and column names if not provided).
:type :: The type of index to use (only supported by some databases)
:unique :: Make the index unique, so duplicate values are not allowed.
:where :: Create a partial index (only supported by some databases)

==== +unique+

The +unique+ method creates a unique constraint on the table.  A unique constraint generally
operates identically to a unique index, so the following three +create_table+ blocks are
pretty much identical:

  create_table(:a){Integer :a, unique: true}

  create_table(:a) do
    Integer :a
    index :a, unique: true
  end

  create_table(:a) do
    Integer :a
    unique :a
  end

Just like +index+, +unique+ can set up a multiple column unique constraint, where the
combination of the columns must be unique:

  create_table(:a) do
    Integer :a
    Integer :b
    unique [:a, :b]
  end

==== +full_text_index+ and +spatial_index+

Both of these create specialized index types supported by some databases.  They
both take the same options as +index+.

==== +constraint+

+constraint+ creates a named table constraint:

  create_table(:artists) do
    primary_key :id
    String :name
    constraint(:name_min_length){char_length(name) > 2}
  end

Instead of using a block, you can use arguments that will be handled similarly
to <tt>Dataset#where</tt>:

  create_table(:artists) do
    primary_key :id
    String :name
    constraint(:name_length_range, Sequel.function(:char_length, :name)=>3..50)
  end

==== +check+

+check+ operates just like +constraint+, except that it doesn't take a name
and it creates an unnamed constraint:

  create_table(:artists) do
    primary_key :id
    String :name
    check{char_length(name) > 2}
  end

It's recommended that you use the +constraint+ method and provide a name for the
constraint, as that makes it easier to drop the constraint later if necessary.

== +create_join_table+

+create_join_table+ is a shortcut that you can use to create simple many-to-many join tables:

  create_join_table(artist_id: :artists, album_id: :albums)

which expands to:

  create_table(:albums_artists) do
    foreign_key :album_id, :albums
    foreign_key :artist_id, :artists
    primary_key [:album_id, :artist_id]
    index [:artist_id, :album_id]
  end

== <tt>create_table :as</tt>

To create a table from the result of a SELECT query, instead of passing a block
to +create_table+, provide a dataset to the :as option:

  create_table(:older_items, as: DB[:items].where{updated_at < Date.today << 6})

== +alter_table+

+alter_table+ is used to alter existing tables, changing their columns, indexes,
or constraints.  It it used just like +create_table+, accepting a block which
is instance_evaled, and providing its own methods:

=== +add_column+

One of the most common methods, +add_column+ is used to add a column to the table.
Its API is similar to that of +create_table+'s +column+ method, where the first
argument is the column name, the second is the type, and the third is an options
hash:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    add_column :copies_sold, Integer, default: 0
  end

=== +drop_column+

As you may expect, +drop_column+ takes a column name and drops the column.  It's
often used in the +down+ block of a migration to drop a column added in an +up+ block:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    drop_column :copies_sold
  end

=== +rename_column+

+rename_column+ is used to rename a column.  It takes the old column name as the first
argument, and the new column name as the second argument:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    rename_column :copies_sold, :total_sales
  end

=== +add_primary_key+

If you forgot to include a primary key on the table, and want to add one later, you
can use +add_primary_key+.  A common use of this is to make many_to_many association
join tables into real models:

  alter_table(:albums_artists) do
    add_primary_key :id
  end

Just like +create_table+'s +primary_key+ method, if you provide an array of symbols,
Sequel will not add a column, but will add a composite primary key constraint:

  alter_table(:albums_artists) do
    add_primary_key [:album_id, :artist_id]
  end

It is possible to specify a name for the primary key constraint: via the :name option:

  alter_table(:albums_artists) do
    add_primary_key [:album_id, :artist_id], :name=>:albums_artists_pkey
  end

If you just want to take an existing single column and make it a primary key, call
+add_primary_key+ with an array with a single symbol:

  alter_table(:artists) do
    add_primary_key [:id]
  end

=== +add_foreign_key+

+add_foreign_key+ can be used to add a new foreign key column or constraint to a table.
Like +add_primary_key+, if you provide it with a symbol as the first argument, it
creates a new column:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    add_foreign_key :artist_id, :artists
  end

If you want to add a new foreign key constraint to an existing column, you provide an
array with a single element:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    add_foreign_key [:artist_id], :artists
  end

It's encouraged to provide a name when adding the constraint, via the :foreign_key_constraint_name
option if adding the column and the constraint:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    add_foreign_key :artist_id, :artists, foreign_key_constraint_name: :albums_artist_id_fkey
  end

or via the :name option if just adding the constraint:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    add_foreign_key [:artist_id], :artists, name: :albums_artist_id_fkey
  end

To set up a multiple column foreign key constraint, use an array with multiple column symbols:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    add_foreign_key [:artist_name, :artist_location], :artists, name: :albums_artist_name_location_fkey
  end

=== +drop_foreign_key+

+drop_foreign_key+ is used to drop foreign keys from tables.  If you provide a symbol as
the first argument, it drops both the foreign key constraint and the column:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    drop_foreign_key :artist_id
  end

If you want to just drop the foreign key constraint without dropping the column, use
an array.  It's encouraged to use the :name option to provide the constraint name to
drop, though on some databases Sequel may be able to find the name through introspection:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    drop_foreign_key [:artist_id], name: :albums_artist_id_fkey
  end

An array is also used to drop a composite foreign key constraint:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    drop_foreign_key [:artist_name, :artist_location], name: :albums_artist_name_location_fkey
  end

If you do not provide a :name option and Sequel is not able to determine the name
to use, it will probably raise a Sequel::Error exception.

=== +add_index+

+add_index+ works just like +create_table+'s +index+ method, creating a new index on
the table:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    add_index :artist_id
  end

It accepts the same options as +create_table+'s +index+ method, and you can set up
a multiple column index using an array:

  alter_table(:albums_artists) do
    add_index [:album_id, :artist_id], unique: true
  end

=== +drop_index+

As you may expect, +drop_index+ drops an existing index:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    drop_index :artist_id
  end

Just like +drop_column+, it is often used in the +down+ block of a migration.

To drop an index with a specific name, use the <tt>:name</tt> option:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    drop_index :artist_id, name: :artists_id_index
  end

=== +add_full_text_index+, +add_spatial_index+

Corresponding to +create_table+'s +full_text_index+ and +spatial_index+ methods,
these two methods create new indexes on the table.

=== +add_constraint+

This adds a named constraint to the table, similar to +create_table+'s +constraint+
method:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    add_constraint(:name_min_length){char_length(name) > 2}
  end

There is no method to add an unnamed constraint, but you can pass +nil+ as the first
argument of +add_constraint+ to do so.  However, it's not recommended to do that
as it is more difficult to drop such a constraint.

=== +add_unique_constraint+

This adds a unique constraint to the table, similar to +create_table+'s +unique+
method.  This usually has the same effect as adding a unique index.

  alter_table(:albums) do
    add_unique_constraint [:artist_id, :name]
  end

You can also specify a name via the :name option when adding the constraint:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    add_unique_constraint [:artist_id, :name], name: :albums_artist_id_name_ukey
  end

=== +drop_constraint+

This method drops an existing named constraint:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    drop_constraint(:name_min_length)
  end

There is no database independent method to drop an unnamed constraint.  Generally, the
database will give it a name automatically, and you will have to figure out what it is.
For that reason, you should not add unnamed constraints that you ever might need to remove.

On some databases, you must specify the type of constraint via a <tt>:type</tt> option:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    drop_constraint(:albums_pk, type: :primary_key)
    drop_constraint(:albums_fk, type: :foreign_key)
    drop_constraint(:albums_uk, type: :unique)
  end

=== +set_column_default+

This modifies the default value of a column:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    set_column_default :copies_sold, 0
  end

To remove a default value for a column, use +nil+ as the value:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    set_column_default :copies_sold, nil
  end

=== +set_column_type+

This modifies a column's type.  Most databases will attempt to convert existing values in
the columns to the new type:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    set_column_type :copies_sold, :Bignum
  end

You can specify the type as a string or symbol, in which case it is used verbatim, or as a supported
ruby class or the :Bignum symbol, in which case it gets converted to an appropriate database type.

=== +set_column_allow_null+

This allows you to set the column as allowing NULL values:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    set_column_allow_null :artist_id
  end

=== +set_column_not_null+

This allows you to set the column as not allowing NULL values:

  alter_table(:albums) do
    set_column_not_null :artist_id
  end

== Other +Database+ schema modification methods

<tt>Sequel::Database</tt> has many schema modification instance methods,
most of which are shortcuts to the same methods in +alter_table+.  The
following +Database+ instance methods just call +alter_table+ with a
block that calls the method with the same name inside the +alter_table+
block with all arguments after the first argument (which is used as
the table name):

* +add_column+
* +drop_column+
* +rename_column+
* +add_index+
* +drop_index+
* +set_column_default+
* +set_column_type+

For example, the following two method calls do the same thing:

  alter_table(:artists){add_column :copies_sold, Integer}
  add_column :artists, :copies_sold, Integer

There are some other schema modification methods that have no +alter_table+
counterpart:

=== +drop_table+

+drop_table+ takes multiple arguments and treats all arguments as a
table name to drop:

  drop_table(:albums_artists, :albums, :artists)

Note that when dropping tables, you may need to drop them in a specific order
if you are using foreign keys and the database is enforcing referential
integrity.  In general, you need to drop the tables containing the foreign
keys before the tables containing the primary keys they reference.

=== <tt>drop_table?</tt>

<tt>drop_table?</tt> is similar to drop_table, except that it only drops
the table if the table already exists.  On some databases, it uses
<tt>IF NOT EXISTS</tt>, on others it does a separate query to check for
existence.

=== +rename_table+

You can rename an existing table using +rename_table+.  Like +rename_column+,
the first argument is the current name, and the second is the new name:

  rename_table(:artist, :artists)

=== <tt>create_table!</tt>

<tt>create_table!</tt> drops the table if it exists
before attempting to create it, so:

  create_table!(:artists) do
    primary_key :id
  end

is the same as:

  drop_table?(:artists)
  create_table(:artists) do
    primary_key :id
  end

=== <tt>create_table?</tt>

<tt>create_table?</tt> only creates the table if it does
not already exist, so:

  create_table?(:artists) do
    primary_key :id
  end

is the same as:

  unless table_exists?(:artists)
    create_table(:artists) do
      primary_key :id
    end
  end

=== +create_view+ and +create_or_replace_view+

These can be used to create views.  The difference between them is that
+create_or_replace_view+ will unconditionally replace an existing view of
the same name, while +create_view+ will probably raise an error.  Both methods
take the name as the first argument, and either an string or a dataset as the
second argument:

  create_view(:gold_albums, DB[:albums].where{copies_sold > 500000})
  create_or_replace_view(:gold_albums, "SELECT * FROM albums WHERE copies_sold > 500000")

=== +drop_view+

+drop_view+ drops existing views.  Just like +drop_table+, it can accept multiple
arguments:

  drop_view(:gold_albums, :platinum_albums)
