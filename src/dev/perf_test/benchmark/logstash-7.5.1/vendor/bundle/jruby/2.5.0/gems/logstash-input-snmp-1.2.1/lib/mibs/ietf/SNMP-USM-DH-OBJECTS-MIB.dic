the base from usmDHParameters, p is the prime from
usmDHParameters, and xa is a new random integer selected by the
agent in the interval 2^(l-1) <= xa < 2^l < p-1.  'l' is the
optional privateValueLength from usmDHParameters in bits.  If 'l'
is omitted, then xa (and xr below) is selected in the interval 0

    where PV1 <> 0.

A successful SET consists of the value 'y' expressed as an OCTET
STRING as above concatenated with the value 'z'(expressed as an
OCTET STRING in the same manner as y) where z = g^xr MOD p, where
g, p and l are as above, and where xr is a new random integer
selected by the manager in the interval 2^(l-1) <= xr < 2^l <
p-1. A SET to an object of this type will fail with the error
wrongValue if the current 'y' does not match the 'y' portion of
the value of the varbind for the object. (E.g. GET yout, SET
concat(yin, z), yout <> yin).

Note that the private values xa and xr are never transmitted from
manager to device or vice versa, only the values y and z.
Obviously, these values must be retained until a successful SET on
the associated object.

The shared secret 'sk' is calculated at the agent as sk = z^xa MOD
p, and at the manager as sk = y^xr MOD p.

Each object definition of this type MUST describe how to map from
the shared secret 'sk' to the operational key value used by the
protocols and operations related to the object.  In general, if n
bits of key are required, the author suggests using the n
right-most bits of the shared secret as the operational key value.""",

ks0 [key schedule 0] of the BLOWFISH cipher from 'Applied
Cryptography' by Bruce Schnier - they could be any relatively
random string of bits.

The manager can use its knowledge of its own random number and the
agent's public value to kickstart its access to the agent in a
secure manner.  Note that the security of this approach is
directly related to the strength of the authorization security of
the out of band provisioning of the managers public value
(e.g. the configuration file), but is not dependent at all on the
strength of the confidentiality of the out of band provisioning
data.""",
