== Sun Mar 17 03:03:03 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Keep header name case when failing to unstructured field

== Wed Feb 24 09:14:56 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Fixing up TODO and Docs

== Sun Mar 22 03:24:15 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 2.1.3

== Thu Jan 28 00:25:02 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Added TMM1's patch to not raise errors if a email is not multipart/report
* Added html_part and text_part now return the first text/html or text/plain part they find. Order is from top to bottom of the email, all parts, flattened.
* Cleaning up register_interceptor and register_observer including documentation
* Renamed #register_for_delivery_notification to #register_observer
* Renamed #register_for_delivery_interception to #register_interceptor
* Adding spec to check for folding of non ASCII words that have been encoded
* Updating Message#inspect to be a bit more friendly... it is for us mere mortals after all
* Version bump to 2.1.2

== Sun Jan 28 02:59:34 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Removed old method of setting delivery_method

== Mon Jan 25 11:36:13 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Added ability for address fields to init on an array instead of just a string.
* Version bump to 2.1.1

== Mon Jan 25 10:36:33 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Now passes a block to the delivery handler, which can just call yield if it want's Mail to just do it's normal delivery method
* Moved Mail.deliveries into Mail::TestMailer.deliveries. Now only gets mail appended to it if you are sending with the :test delivery_method (only for testing)
* Version bump to 2.1.0

== Mon Jan 25 01:44:13 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Change :deliver! to deliver a mail object, bypassing the :perform_deliveries and :raise_delivery_errors flags, also does not append the mail object to Mail.deliveries, thus the ! (dangerous).  The intended use for :deliver! is for people wanting to have their own delivery_handler (like ActionMailer uses) to track and handle delivery failures.
* Added :delivery_handler to Message.  Allows you to pass an object that will be sent :deliver_mail(self) by the Mail::Message instance when it is sent :deliver and bypasses the usual delivery method.
* Changed :perform_deliveries flag to be more consistent with it's name, mail will not append itself to the Mail.deliveries collection if :perform_deliveries is false

== Sat Jan 23 23:49:50 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 2.0.5
* Added :raise_delivery_errors to Mail::Message, if set to false will silently rescue all errors raised by the delivery methods, set to true by default

== Sat Jan 23 23:28:42 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 2.0.4
* Added :perform_deliveries to mail, will not actually call deliver on the delivery method if this is set to false, set to true by default.
* Added @delivery_notification_observers to mail messages, you can register an observer with mail by calling mail.register_for_delivery_notification(observer) and then when mail is told to :deliver it will call your observer with observer.delivered_email(self).  It will call your observer if it actually performed the delivery or not (that is, irregardless of the :perform_deliveries flag)
* Added ability to overwrite the Mail.deliveries store with an object of your choice instead of just an array, this is a good way to find out if something actually got delivered as if :perform_deliveries is false, this collection will not get the mail message appended

== Sat Jan 23 05:32:53 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 2.0.3
* Made body.sort_parts! recursive, to do the entire body
* Added ability to use << on the results returned by the various address fields, ie, mail.to << 'new@address' now works
* Message now adds multipart/mixed as the content type if nothing is set and there are parts to the message
* Added #display_names and #addrs to all address fields.  #addrs returns the actual Mail::Address object for each address in the field.
* Body should call to_s on given input... incase someone gave it an IO.readlines result (Array)
*

== Thu Jan 21 05:27:17 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 2.0.2
* Major change to attachments, add_file now only accepts
  {:filename => 'full/path/to/file.png'} or
  {:filename => 'file.png', :content => 'string of file content'}
  you can also now do mail.attachments['filename.png'] = File.read('path/to/file.png')
  which is nice too!

== Fri Jan 15 09:20:51 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Rewrote all network classes to not use singletons.  Means different Mail::Message objects can have different delivery methods.
* Added examples for how to send via GMail, MobileMe, Sendmail, File etc.
* Version bump to 2.0.0 as Network API changed drastically, now not a singleton class.
* Fixed that return-path should only return one address

== Thu Jan 14 10:41:22 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version update to 1.6.0 - API change on mail.address_fields to always return arrays
* Updated all message.address_field methods to always return arrays, so mail.from #=> ['one@address.com'] now, is least surprise
* Updated handling of empty group lists so it didn't crash

== Thu Jan 12 10:41:47 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version 1.5.3, handling invalid input on fields.  Highly recommended update
* Updated fields to always try parsing the given data (unless blank). This allows mail to catch invalid input and return UnstructuredFields. Makes mail a lot more resistant to invalid input.

== Fri  8 Jan 2010 00:00:08 UTC Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 1.5.2

== Fri  8 Jan 8:55:49 2010 +1100 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Moving the require for tlsmail for Ruby 1.8.6 into mail.rb

== Sun Jan  3 00:08:06 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 1.5.0

* Major API change in Message#field_name.  This WILL break your applications that use Mail.  Message#field_name now returns good, intelligent, default values.  You can still access the field object by calling Message#[:field_name] or Message#['field_name'].

== Sat Jan  2 04:12:53 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Message-ID, Content-ID, References et al, now return the default value of the message ID without the angle brackets, as per RFC 2822, "Semantically, the angle bracket characters are not part of the msg-id; the msg-id is what is contained between the two angle bracket characters."

* Message class now has getter and setter methods for all the supported field types explicitly.  This allows us to return a "default" value for all fields.

* All address fields, when called from Message#to or Message#from or the like, return either a string of the address spec (mikel@test.lindsaar.net) if it is a single entry, or an array of address specs if there is more than one ['mikel@test.lindsaar.net', 'ada@test.lindsaar.net']

== Mon 28 Dec 2009 01:21:52 UTC Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Added sorting of parts, default is text/plain, then text/enriched and text/html.  Access through  Body#set_sort_order and Body#sort_parts! (called from Body#encode automatically)
* Version bump to 1.4.2

== Sun Dec 27 10:38:24 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

  nil
* Version bump to 1.4.1

== Sun Dec 27 09:51:27 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Version bump to 1.4 because now :to_s calls :decoded for all fields and body
  while :to_s calls :encoded for Message and Header containers.  Makes sense...
  really.

== Sun Dec 27 07:30:02 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Changed fields to default to :decoded on :to_s, all container objects
  retain :encoded as the default for :to_s

* Added ability to create new email via a hash or hash-like object. <mikel>
* Moved all of the Part init into the Message class.  Part now just uses Message's init,
  also moved all the attachment related functions into Message.  As Part is a subclass

== Fri Nov  6 22:52:10 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* a6ef2b4: Fixed Issue #4 - Can't call encoding on non existant
  content-transer-encoding header

== Fri Nov  6 00:51:55 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>

* Renamed Mail::Message.encode! to Mail::Message.ready_to_send!, deprecated :encode! <mikel>
* Rewrote encoding and decoding methods on all classes.  Adds a lot of boiler plate code, but allows us to
  be really precise in each field type that needs custom encoding.  Now all encoding is done by the field_type
  itself.  Need to follow through on the body. <mikel>
* Bump version to 1.2.0 due to changes of :encoded, :decoded behaviour <mikel>

== Tue Nov  3 00:59:45 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>
