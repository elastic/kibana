= Code Order

In Sequel, the order in which code is executed during initialization is important.  This
guide provides the recommended way to order your Sequel code.  Some
of these guidelines are not strictly necessary, but others are, and
this guide will be specific about which are strictly necessary.

== Require Sequel

This is sort of a no brainer, but you need to require the library
first.  This is a strict requirement, none of the other code can
be executed unless the library has been required first. Example:

  require 'sequel'

== Add Global Extensions

Global extensions are loaded with Sequel.extension, and affect
other parts of Sequel or the general ruby environment.  It's not
necessary to load them first, but it is a recommended practice.
Example:

  Sequel.extension :blank

== Add Extensions Applied to All Databases/Datasets

If you want database or datasets extensions applied to all databases
and datasets, you must use Sequel::Database.extension to load the
extension before connecting to a database.  If you connect to a
database before using Sequel::Database.extension, it will not have
that extension loaded. Example:

  Sequel::Database.extension :columns_introspection

== Connect to Databases

Connecting to a database is required before running any queries against
that database, or creating any datasets or models.  You cannot create
model classes without having a database object created first.  The
convention for an application with a single Database instance is to
store that instance in a constant named DB.  Example:

  DB = Sequel.connect('postgres://user:pass@host/database')

== Add Extensions Specific to a Database or All Datasets in that Database

If you want specific databases to use specific extensions, or have all
datasets in that database use a specific extension, you need to load that
extension into the database after creating it using
Sequel::Database#extension.  Example:

  DB.extension :pg_array

== Configure Global Model Behavior

If you want to change the configuration for all model classes, you must do
so before loading your model classes, as configuration is copied into the
subclass when model subclasses are created.  Example:

  Sequel::Model.raise_on_save_failure = false

== Add Global Model Plugins

If you want to load a plugin into all models classes, you must do so
before loading your model classes, as plugin specific data may need to be
copied into the subclass when model subclasses are created.  Example:

  Sequel::Model.plugin :prepared_statements

== Load Model Classes

After you have established a database connection, and configured your
global model configration and global plugins, you can load your model
classes.  It's recommended to have a separate file for each model class,
unless the model classes are very simple.  Example:

  Dir['./models/*.rb'].each{|f| require f}

== Finalize Associations and Freeze Model Classes and Database

After all the models have been setup, you can finalize the associations.
This can speed up association reflection methods by doing a lookup in
advance to find the associated class, and cache related association
information in the association itself.

Additionally, in production and testing, you should freeze the
model classes and Database instance, so that you can detect
unsafe runtime modification of the configuration:

  model_classes.each(&:finalize_associations)
  model_classes.each(&:freeze)
  DB.freeze

== Disconnect If Using Forking Webserver with Code Preloading

If you are using a forking webserver such as unicorn or passenger, with
a feature that loads your Sequel code before forking connections (code
preloading), then you must disconnect your database connections before
forking.  If you don't do this, you can end up with child processes
sharing database connections and all sorts of weird behavior.  Sequel
will automatically reconnect on an as needed basis in the child
processes, so you only need to do the following in the parent process:

  DB.disconnect
