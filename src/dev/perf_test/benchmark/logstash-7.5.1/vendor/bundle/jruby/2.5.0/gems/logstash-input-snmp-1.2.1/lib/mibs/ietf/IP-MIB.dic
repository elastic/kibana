address and it shouldn't appear as the destination or source
address of a packet.

accessible because the interface to which this address is
assigned is not operational.

The unknown(5) state indicates that the status cannot be
determined for some reason.

The tentative(6) state indicates that the uniqueness of the
address on the link is being verified.  Addresses in this
state should not be used for general communication and
should only be used to determine the uniqueness of the
address.

determined to be non-unique on the link and so must not be



used.

a link is being verified.

Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect
of invalidating the corresponding entry in the
ipNetToPhysicalTable.  That is, it effectively dis-
associates the interface identified with said entry from the
mapping identified with said entry.  It is an
implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent



removes an invalidated entry from the table.  Accordingly,
management stations must be prepared to receive tabular
information from agents that corresponds to entries not
currently in use.  Proper interpretation of such entries
requires examination of the relevant ipNetToPhysicalType
object.

The 'dynamic(3)' type indicates that the IP address to
physical addresses mapping has been dynamically resolved
using e.g., IPv4 ARP or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
protocol.

The 'static(4)' type indicates that the mapping has been
statically configured.  Both of these refer to entries that
provide mappings for other entities addresses.

The 'local(5)' type indicates that the mapping is provided
for an entity's own interface address.
