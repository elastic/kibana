=== Jdbc_static filter plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

This filter enriches events with data pre-loaded from a remote database.

This filter is best suited for enriching events with reference data that is
static or does not change very often, such as environments, users, and products.

This filter works by fetching data from a remote database, caching it in a
local, in-memory https://db.apache.org/derby/manuals/#docs_10.14[Apache Derby]
database, and using lookups to enrich events with data cached in the local
database. You can set up the filter to load the remote data once (for static
data), or you can schedule remote loading to run periodically (for data that
needs to be refreshed).

To define the filter, you specify three main sections: local_db_objects, loaders,
and lookups.

*local_db_objects*::

Define the columns, types, and indexes used to build the local database
structure. The column names and types should match the external database.
Define as many of these objects as needed to build the local database
structure.

*loaders*::

Query the external database to fetch the dataset that will be cached locally.
Define as many loaders as needed to fetch the remote data. Each
loader should fill a table defined by `local_db_objects`. Make sure
the column names and datatypes in the loader SQL statement match the
columns defined under `local_db_objects`. Each loader has an independent remote
database connection.

*lookups*::

Perform lookup queries on the local database to enrich the events.
Define as many lookups as needed to enrich the event from all
lookup tables in one pass. Ideally the SQL statement should only
return one row. Any rows are converted to Hash objects and are
stored in a target field that is an Array.
+
The following example config fetches data from a remote database, caches it in a
local database, and uses lookups to enrich events with data cached in the local
database.

<1> Queries an external database to fetch the dataset that will be cached
locally.
<2> Defines the columns, types, and indexes used to build the local database
structure. The column names and types should match the external database.
The order of table definitions is significant and should match that of the loader queries.
See <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-object_order>>.
<3> Performs lookup queries on the local database to enrich the events.
<4> Specifies the event field that will store the looked-up data. If the lookup
returns multiple columns, the data is stored as a JSON object within the field.
<5> Takes data from the JSON object and stores it in top-level event fields for
easier analysis in Kibana.

Assuming the loader fetches the following data from a Postgres database:

[source,shell]
select * from ref.local_ips order by ip;
    ip     |         descr
-----------+-----------------------
 10.2.3.10 | Authentication Server
 10.2.3.20 | Payments Server
 10.2.3.30 | Events Server
 10.2.3.40 | Payroll Server
 10.2.3.50 | Uploads Server


The events are enriched with a description of the server based on the value of
the IP:

[source,shell]
{
           "app" => "bazfoo",
      "sequence" => 0,
        "server" => [
        [0] {
            "description" => "Payroll Server"
        }
    ],
        "amount" => 22.95,
    "@timestamp" => 2017-11-30T18:08:15.694Z,
      "@version" => "1",
          "host" => "Elastics-MacBook-Pro.local",
       "message" => "{\"from_ip\": \"10.2.3.40\", \"app\": \"bazfoo\", \"amount\": 22.95}",
       "from_ip" => "10.2.3.40"
}


==== Using this plugin with multiple pipelines

[IMPORTANT]
===============================
Logstash uses a single, in-memory Apache Derby instance as the lookup database
engine for the entire JVM. Because each plugin instance uses a unique database
inside the shared Derby engine, there should be no conflicts with plugins
attempting to create and populate the same tables. This is true regardless of
whether the plugins are defined in a single pipeline, or multiple pipelines.
However, after setting up the filter, you should watch the lookup results and
view the logs to verify correct operation.
===============================

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-object_order"]
==== Loader column and local_db_object order dependency

[IMPORTANT]
===============================
For loader performance reasons, the loading mechanism uses a CSV style file with an inbuilt
Derby file import procedure to add the remote data to the local db. The retrieved columns
are written to the CSV file as is and the file import procedure expects a 1 to 1 correspondence
to the order of the columns specified in the local_db_object settings. Please ensure that this
order is in place.

Also see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> for a list of options supported by all
filter plugins.

&nbsp;

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-jdbc_connection_string"]
===== `jdbc_connection_string`

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

JDBC connection string.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-jdbc_driver_class"]
===== `jdbc_driver_class`

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

JDBC driver class to load, for example, "org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver".

NOTE: According to https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-jdbc/issues/43[Issue 43],
if you are using the Oracle JDBC driver (ojdbc6.jar), the correct
`jdbc_driver_class` is `"Java::oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver"`.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-jdbc_driver_library"]
===== `jdbc_driver_library`

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

JDBC driver library path to third-party driver library. Use comma separated paths
in one string if you need multiple libraries.

If the driver class is not provided, the plugin looks for it in the Logstash
Java classpath.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-jdbc_password"]
===== `jdbc_password`

  * Value type is <<password,password>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

JDBC password.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-jdbc_user"]
===== `jdbc_user`

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

JDBC user.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-tag_on_default_use"]
===== `tag_on_default_use`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `["_jdbcstaticdefaultsused"]`

Append values to the `tags` field if no record was found and default values were used.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-tag_on_failure"]
===== `tag_on_failure`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `["_jdbcstaticfailure"]`

Append values to the `tags` field if a SQL error occurred.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-staging_directory"]
===== `staging_directory`

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is derived from the Ruby temp directory + plugin_name + "import_data"
  * e.g. `"/tmp/logstash/jdbc_static/import_data"`

The directory used stage the data for bulk loading, there should be sufficient
disk space to handle the data you wish to use to enrich events.
Previous versions of this plugin did not handle loading datasets of more than
several thousand rows well due to an open bug in Apache Derby. This setting
introduces an alternative way of loading large recordsets. As each row is
received it is spooled to file and then that file is imported using a
system 'import table' system call.

Append values to the `tags` field if a SQL error occurred.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-loader_schedule"]
===== `loader_schedule`

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

You can schedule remote loading to run periodically according to a
specific schedule. This scheduling syntax is powered by
https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler[rufus-scheduler]. The
syntax is cron-like with some extensions specific to Rufus
(for example, timezone support). For more about this syntax, see
https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler#parsing-cronlines-and-time-strings[parsing cronlines and time strings].

Examples:

|==========================================================
| `*/30 * * * *`              | will execute on the 0th and 30th minute of every hour every day.
| `* 5 * 1-3 *`               | will execute every minute of 5am every day of January through March.
| `0 * * * *`                 | will execute on the 0th minute of every hour every day.
| `0 6 * * * America/Chicago` | will execute at 6:00am (UTC/GMT -5) every day.
|==========================================================

Debugging using the Logstash interactive shell:
[source,shell]
bin/logstash -i irb
irb(main):001:0> require 'rufus-scheduler'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> Rufus::Scheduler.parse('*/10 * * * *')
=> #<Rufus::Scheduler::CronLine:0x230f8709 @timezone=nil, @weekdays=nil, @days=nil, @seconds=[0], @minutes=[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50], @hours=nil, @months=nil, @monthdays=nil, @original="*/10 * * * *">
irb(main):003:0> exit


The object returned by the above call, an instance of `Rufus::Scheduler::CronLine` shows the seconds, minutes etc. of execution.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-loaders"]
===== `loaders`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

The array should contain one or more Hashes. Each Hash is validated
according to the table below.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Input type|Required
| id|string|No
| table|string|Yes
| query|string|Yes
| max_rows|number|No
| jdbc_connection_string|string|No
| jdbc_driver_class|string|No
| jdbc_driver_library|a valid filesystem path|No
| jdbc_password|password|No
| jdbc_user|string|No
|=======================================================================

*Loader Field Descriptions:*

id::
An optional identifier. This is used to identify the loader that is
generating error messages and log lines.

table::
The destination table in the local lookup database that the loader will fill.

query::
The SQL statement that is executed to fetch the remote records. Use SQL
aliases and casts to ensure that the record's columns and datatype match the
table structure in the local database as defined in the `local_db_objects`.

max_rows::
The default for this setting is 1 million. Because the lookup database is
in-memory, it will take up JVM heap space. If the query returns many millions
of rows, you should increase the JVM memory given to Logstash or limit the
number of rows returned, perhaps to those most frequently found in the
event data.

jdbc_connection_string::
If not set in a loader, this setting defaults to the plugin-level
`jdbc_connection_string` setting.

jdbc_driver_class::
If not set in a loader, this setting defaults to the plugin-level
`jdbc_driver_class` setting.

jdbc_driver_library::
If not set in a loader, this setting defaults to the plugin-level
`jdbc_driver_library` setting.

jdbc_password::
If not set in a loader, this setting defaults to the plugin-level
`jdbc_password` setting.

jdbc_user::
If not set in a loader, this setting defaults to the plugin-level
`jdbc_user` setting.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-local_db_objects"]
===== `local_db_objects`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

The array should contain one or more Hashes. Each Hash represents a table
schema for the local lookups database. Each Hash is validated
according to the table below.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Input type|Required
| name|string|Yes
| columns|array|Yes
| index_columns|number|No
| preserve_existing|boolean|No
|=======================================================================

*Local_db_objects Field Descriptions:*

name::
The name of the table to be created in the database.

columns::
An array of column specifications. Each column specification is an array
of exactly two elements, for example `["ip", "varchar(15)"]`. The first
element is the column name string. The second element is a string that
is an
https://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.14/ref/crefsqlj31068.html[Apache Derby SQL type].
The string content is checked when the local lookup tables are built, not when
the settings are validated. Therefore, any misspelled SQL type strings result in
errors.

index_columns::
An array of strings. Each string must be defined in the `columns` setting. The
index name will be generated internally. Unique or sorted indexes are not
supported.

preserve_existing::
This setting, when `true`, checks whether the table already exists in the local
lookup database. If you have multiple pipelines running in the same
instance of Logstash, and more than one pipeline is using this plugin, then you
must read the important multiple pipeline notice at the top of the page.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-local_lookups"]
===== `local_lookups`

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

The array should contain one or more Hashes. Each Hash represents a lookup
enrichment. Each Hash is validated according to the table below.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Input type|Required
| id|string|No
| query|string|Yes
| parameters|hash|Yes
| target|string|No
| default_hash|hash|No
| tag_on_failure|string|No
| tag_on_default_use|string|No
|=======================================================================

*Local_lookups Field Descriptions:*

id::
An optional identifier. This is used to identify the lookup that is
generating error messages and log lines. If you omit this setting then a
default id is used instead.

query::
A SQL SELECT statement that is executed to achieve the lookup. To use
parameters, use named parameter syntax, for example
`"SELECT * FROM MYTABLE WHERE ID = :id"`.

parameters::
A key/value Hash or dictionary. The key (LHS) is the text that is
substituted for in the SQL statement
`SELECT * FROM sensors WHERE reference = :p1`. The value (RHS)
is the field name in your event. The plugin reads the value from
this key out of the event and substitutes that value into the
statement, for example, `parameters => { "p1" => "ref" }`. Quoting is
automatic - you do not need to put quotes in the statement.
Only use the field interpolation syntax on the RHS if you need to
add a prefix/suffix or join two event field values together to build
the substitution value. For example, imagine an IOT message that has
an id and a location, and you have a table of sensors that have a
column of `id-loc_id`. In this case your parameter hash would look
like this: `parameters => { "p1" => "%{[id]}-%{[loc_id]}" }`.

target::
An optional name for the field that will receive the looked-up data.
If you omit this setting then the `id` setting (or the default id) is
used. The looked-up data, an array of results converted to Hashes, is
never added to the root of the event. If you want to do this, you
should use the `add_field` setting. This means that
you are in full control of how the fields/values are put in the root
of the event, for example,
`add_field => { user_firstname => "%{[user][0][firstname]}" }` -
where `[user]` is the target field, `[0]` is the first result in the
array, and `[firstname]` is the key in the result hash.

default_hash::
An optional hash that will be put in the target field array when the
lookup returns no results. Use this setting if you need to ensure that later
references in other parts of the config actually refer to something.

tag_on_failure::
An optional string that overrides the plugin-level setting. This is
useful when defining multiple lookups.

tag_on_default_use::
An optional string that overrides the plugin-level setting. This is
useful when defining multiple lookups.
