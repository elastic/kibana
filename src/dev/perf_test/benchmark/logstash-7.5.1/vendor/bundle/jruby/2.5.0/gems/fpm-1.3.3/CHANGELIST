    containing only /etc/skel/.zshrc
    For more, see https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki/Source:-dir#mapping

    'fpm -s npm -t deb express'

0.4.32 (April 9, 2013)
  - COMPATIBILITY WARNING: rpm: The default epoch is now nothing because this
    aligns more closely with typical rpm packages in the real world. This
    decision was reached in #381. If you need the previous behavior, you
    must now specify '--epoch 1' (#388, patch by Pranay Kanwar)
  - python: new flag --python-obey-requirements-txt which makes a
    requirements.txt file from the python package used for the package
    dependencies instead of the usual setup.py dependencies. The default
    behavior without this flag is to respect setup.py. (#384)
  - deb: new flag --deb-shlibs to specify the content of the 'shlibs' file
    in the debian package (#405, patch by Aman Gupta)

  - rpm: dashes are now replaced with underscores in rpm version strings
    (#395, #393, #399;  patches by Jeff Terrace and Richard Guest)
  - python: Only use the first line of a license; some python packages (like
    'requests') embed their full license copy into the license field. For
    the sake of sanity and function with most packaging systems, fpm only
    uses the first line of that license.
  - rpm: Add new 'none' option to --rpm-compression to disable compression
    entirely. (#398, patch by Richard Guest)
  - deb: Make dependencies using the '!=' operator represented as "Breaks"
    in the deb package (previously used "Conflicts"). (#400)
  - deb: Add md5sums to the debian packages which improves correctness
    of the package. (#403, #401; patch by Pranay Kanwar)
  - rpm: Convert all '!=' dependency operators to 'Conflicts'. Previously,
    this only applied to packages converting from python to rpm. 
    (#404, #396; patch by Pranay Kanwar)

0.4.31 (March 21, 2013)
  - rpm: new flag --rpm-use-file-permissions which try to create an rpm

    pattern (#323, patch by Pranay Kanwar)

  - pear: add flags --pear-bin-dir --pear-php-bin --pear-php-dir (#358, patch
    by Zsolt Takács)
  - New 'source' type: empty. Allows you to create packages without any files
    in them (sometimes called 'meta packages'). Useful when you want to have
    one package be simply dependencies or when you want to spoof a package
    you don't want installed, etc. (#359, 349; patch by Pranay Kanwar)
  - solaris: Add --solaris-user and --solaris-group flags (#342, Patch by Derek
    Olsen)
  - gem: new flag --env-shebang; default true (disable with --no-env-shebang).
    Lets you disable #! (shebang) mangling done by gem installation. (#363,
    patch by Grier Johnson)

    rtucker-mozilla)
  - deb: Add --deb-field for setting a custom field in the control file.
    For more information on this setting, see section 5.7 "User-defined fields"
    of the debian policy manual: 
    http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s5.7
  - deb: Add --deb-recommends and --deb-suggests (#285, #310; patch by Pranay

    'cp -d' on OSX)

    Ritschard)

0.4.23 (November 26, 2012)
  - The --directories flag is now recursive when the output package is rpm.

0.4.18 (September 25, 2012)
  - Fix regression in rpm building where the epoch in was missing in the rpm,
    but prior fpm versions defaulted it to 1. This caused rpms built with newer

  - deb: add --deb-priority flag (#232) for setting the debian 'priority'
    value for your package.
  - add --template-value. Used to expose arbitrary values to script templates.
    If you do --template-value hello=world, in your template you can do
    <%= hello %> to get 'world' to show up in your maintainer scripts.
  - python: add --python-install-data flag to set the --install-data option to
    setup.py (#255, patch by Thomas Meson)

    jimbrowne)
  - dir: don't try to set utime on symlinks (#234, #240, patch by ctgswallow)

    Example: fpm -s dir -t rpm --prefix /usr/local -n example /etc/motd 
    (patch by jkoppe)

  - Set default temporary directory to /tmp 
    (https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/174)
  - Improve symlink handling (patch by Aleix Conchillo Flaqué, pull/177))
  - Python package support changes (thanks to input by Luke Macken):
    * New flag: --python-install-bin. Sets the location for python package
      scripts (default: /usr/bin)
    * New flag: --python-install-lib. Sets the location for the python
      package to install libs to, default varies by system. Usually something
      like /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages.
    * Fix up --prefix support
    * Improve staged package installation

0.4.1 (March 19, 2012)
  - Fix fpm so it works in ruby 1.8 again.
    Tests run, and passing:
      rvm 1.8.7,1.9.2,1.9.3 do bundle exec rspec

0.4.0 (March 18, 2012)
  - Complete rewrite of pretty much everything.
    * Otherwise, the 'fpm' command functionality should be the same
    * Please let me know if something broke!
  - Now has an API (see examples/api directory)
  - Also has a proper test suite
  - Updated the rpm spec generator to disable all the ways I've found rpmbuild
    to molest packages. This means that fpm-generated rpms will no longer
    strip libraries, move files around, randomly mutate jar files, etc.
  - Add --license and --vendor settings (via Pieter Loubser)
  - python support: try to name python packages sanely. Some pypi packages
    are literally called 'python-foo' so make sure we generate packages named
    'python-foo' and not 'python-python-foo' (via Thomas Meson)
  - rpm support: Add --rpm-rpmbuild-define for passing a --define flag to rpmbuild
    (via Naresh V)
  - PHP pear source support (fpm -s pear ...) (via Andrew Gaffney)

    flag. (Matt Patterson)

  - (debian) quote paths in md5sum calls (Matt Patterson)
  - (debian) quiet stderr from dpkg --print-architecture

0.3.9 (Sep 8, 2011)
  - Fix bug in 'dir' source that breaks full paths
  - Added a bunch of tests (yaay)

0.3.8 and earlier: I have not kept this file up to date very well... Sorry :(

0.2.29 (May 20, 2011)
  - Add 'tar' source support. Useful for binary releases to repackage as rpms
    and debs. Example:
      fpm -s tar -t rpm -n firefox -v 4.0.1 \
        --prefix /opt/firefox/4.0.1 firefox-4.0.1.tar.bz2

0.2.28 (May 18, 2011)
  - Use --replaces as "Obsoletes" in rpms.

0.2.27 (May 18, 2011)
  - If present, DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME environment variables will be used as
    the default maintainer. Previously the default was simply <$user@$hostname>
    https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/37
  - Add '--replaces' flag for specifying packages replaced by the one you are
    building. This only functions in .deb packages now until I find a suitable
    synonym in RPM.
  - Add --python-bin and --python-easyinstall flags. This lets you choose specific
    python and easy_install tools to use when building. Default is simply
    'python' and 'easy_install' respectively.
  - Add support for ~/.fpmrc - The format of this file is the same as the flags.
    One flag per line. https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/38
    Example:
      --python-bin=/usr/bin/python2.7
      --python-easyinstall=/usr/bin/easy_install2.7

0.2.26 and earlier
  No changelist tracked. My bad, yo.
