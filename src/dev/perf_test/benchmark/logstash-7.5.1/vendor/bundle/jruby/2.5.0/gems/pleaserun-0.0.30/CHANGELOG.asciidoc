= Pleaserun Changes and Releases

== 0.0.29 (April 17, 2017)
  * `pleaserun --version` will now write the version of pleaserun and exit. (#125)

== 0.0.28 (February 6, 2017)
  * sysv and upstart will now `set -a` before loading /etc/default and
    /etc/sysconfig files. This is to bring them in line with what users are
    asking me as well as with what systemd does with these files. (#121)

== 0.0.27 (November 4, 2016)
  * Fix a bug where upstart jobs would fail to run if the job's user was not root.
  * upstart: Add nice and limit_open_files support for Upstart 0.6.5
  * systemd: Add support for Nice and LimitNOFILE. Fixes #120
  * upstart: Added support for environment variables in Upstart 0.6.5
  * Environment variables for services can now be specified with
    --environment-file and --environment-variable flags.

== 0.0.24 (May 20, 2016)
  * Fix bug where rubygem packages dont' seem to ship symlinks, so the
    'default' target version for some platforms was not found. Now, instead of 
    symlinking 'default' to whatever should be the default, we just have the 
    default as a directory specifically. Hopefully this helps.

== 0.0.23 (May 19, 2016)
  * Catch JRuby IOError when execution of a missing file fails.
 
== 0.0.22 (May 18, 2016)
  * systemd platform now defaults to targeting /etc/systemd/system for writing
    unit files. This was chosen based on research across across 7 different
    Linux distributions.
  * fix a bug where attempting to detect systemd would crash becuase
    `systemctl` was not available.

== 0.0.21 (May 16, 2016)
  * Platform detection mechanism now looks for evidence that a given platform
    is available (files, executables, etc).  The previous mechanism used facter
    or ohai to figure out the operating system version and had a mapping of OS to
    platform.

== 0.0.20 (May 13, 2016)
  * The --install-prefix flag now sets the write path for both --install and --no-install (default) modes

== 0.0.19 (May 6, 2016)
  * Fix bug in OS detection
  
== 0.0.18 (May 6, 2016)
  * Support newer Facter api (Aaron Mildtenstein)

== 0.0.17 (May 4, 2016)
  * Added detection for Fedora 22 and 23, OS X 10.11, and Ubuntu 14.10, 15.04, 15.50, and 16.04. (#98, Aaron Mildenstein)

== 0.0.13  (April 30, 2015)
  * Now supports MRI 1.9.3 (Vincent Janelle)
  * cli: New flag --install-prefix. This lets you tell pleaserun what directory to write things.
  * cli: New flag --[no-]install-actions. If enabled, will run any required installation actions in order to signal the local system to load your newly created service.
  * upstart: now only generates the .conf file, not the init script,
    since it's not needed.
  * sysv: Add ulimit support
  * detection: Amazon Linux is now detected and, because it is based on RHEL6, defaults to Upstart 0.6.5 (Bob Miller, #68)
  * misc: The ohai gem is now optional. Ohai is incompatible with JRuby, so I don't want to require it by default. The ohai gem will still be used, if present, during platform detection.
  * cli: New flag --sysv-log-path. This lets you set the path for the sysv platform to log its output.

== 0.0.4 (March 5, 2014)
  * cli: Autodetect OSX and use launchd
