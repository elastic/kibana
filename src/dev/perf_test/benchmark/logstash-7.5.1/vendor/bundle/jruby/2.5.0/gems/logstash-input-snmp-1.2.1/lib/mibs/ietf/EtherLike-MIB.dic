revisions:

- Updated dot3StatsAlignmentErrors and
  dot3StatsSymbolErrors DESCRIPTIONs to
  reflect behaviour at 10 Gb/s
- Added dot3StatsRateControlAbility and
  dot3RateControlStatus for management
  of the Rate Control function in 10 Gb/s
  WAN applications
- Added 64-bit versions of all counters
  that are used on high-speed ethernet
  interfaces
- Added object groups to contain the new
  objects
- Deprecated etherStatsBaseGroup and
  split into etherStatsBaseGroup2 and
  etherStatsHalfDuplexGroup, so that
  interfaces which can only operate at
  full-duplex do not need to implement
  half-duplex-only statistics
- Deprecated dot3Compliance and replaced
  it with dot3Compliance2, which includes
  the compliance information for the new
  object groups




In addition, the dot3Tests and dot3Errors
object identities have been deprecated,
since there is no longer a standard method
for using them.
