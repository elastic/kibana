description: Running ESLint in a way that enabled advanced rules which consume the TypeScript type checker

By default ESLint works on a single file, parses that files to an abtract-syntax-tree (AST), and then writes validations against the syntax in that one file. This prevents us from using fancy rules which validate code based on the types of a specific variable, or anything along those lines. Running ESLint *with types* loads a specific TypeScript project into the ESLint context and uses it to include properties of the types to inform specific validations.

The only rule we have enabled so far is `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-exports` [[docs](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/consistent-type-exports/)].

## Usage

```
node scripts/eslint_with_types --help
```

## How it works

Because ESLint needs to load up the TypeScript project into memory this script can only lint the code for one TypeScript project at a time. To take advantage of modern CPUs and introduce parallelsim to ESLint we run a number of ESLint processes in parallel, each loading a different TypeScript project into memory and then exitting, allowing a new worker to be spawned.

To tell ESLint which project to load, we actually generate an ESLint config file which points to the right tsconfig.json file and includes the rules we are going to validate for that project.

## Parallel ESLint?!

Yep! If you've ever tried to run ESLint on the whole project you know that it takes approximately 40 years. It's actually one of the slowest parts single parts of CI. We are aiming to make ESLint (with types) the default linter soon, deprecating or removing the global ESLint config.

## How do I customize the rules for my plugin?

We don't support that yet and are trying to come up with a way that supports some amount of customizability without support for 200+ unique configurations for ESLint based on which directory you're in an thousands of `// eslint-disable-next-line`s all over the repo because rules are incorrectly managed.
