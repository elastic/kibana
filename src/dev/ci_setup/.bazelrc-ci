# Inspired on https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/.circleci/bazel.linux.rc
# These options are only enabled when running on CI
# That is done by copying this file into "$HOME/.bazelrc" which loads after the .bazelrc into the workspace

# Import and load bazelrc common settings for ci env
try-import %workspace%/src/dev/ci_setup/.bazelrc-ci.common

# Remote cache settings for ci env
# build --google_default_credentials
# build --remote_upload_local_results=true
