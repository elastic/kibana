/**
 * The HashedItemStore associates JSON objects with states in browser history and persists these
 * objects in sessionStorage. We persist them so that when a tab is closed and re-opened, we can
 * retain access to the state objects referenced by the browser history.
 *
 * Because there is a limit on how much data we can put into sessionStorage, the HashedItemStore
 * will attempt to remove old items from storage once that limit is reached.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Consideration 1: We can't (easily) mirror the browser history
 *
 * If we use letters to indicate a unique state object, and numbers to represent the same state
 * occurring again (due to action by the user), a history could look like this:
 *
 * Old < - - - - - - - - > New
 * A1 | B1 | C1 | A2 | D1 | E1
 *
 * If the user navigates back to C1 and starts to create new states, persisted history states will
 * become inaccessible:
 *
 * Old < - - - - - - - - - - -> New
 * A1 | B1 | C1 | F1 | G1 | H1 | I1  (new history states)
 *                A2 | D1 | E1       (inaccessible persisted history states)
 *
 * Theoretically, we could build a mirror of the browser history. When the onpopstate event is
 * dispatched, we could determine whether we have gone back or forward in history. Then, when
 * a new state is persisted, we could delete all of the persisted items which are no longer
 * accessible. (Note that this would require reference-counting so that A isn't removed while D and
 * E are, since A would still have a remaining reference from A1).
 *
 * However, the History API doesn't allow us to read from the history beyond the current state. This
 * means that if a session is restored, we can't rebuild this browser history mirror.
 *
 * Due to this imperfect implementation, HashedItemStore ignores the possibility of inaccessible
 * history states. In the future, we could implement this history mirror and persist it in
 * sessionStorage too. Then, when restoring a session, we can just retrieve it from sessionStorage.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Consideration 2: We can't tell when we've hit the browser history limit
 *
 * Because some of our persisted history states may no longer be referenced by the browser history,
 * and we have no way of knowing which ones, we have no way of knowing whether we've persisted a
 * number of accessible states beyond the browser history length limit.
 *
 * More fundamentally, the browser history length limit is a browser implementation detail, so it
 * can change from browser to browser, or over time. Respecting this limit would introduce a lot of
 * (unnecessary?) complexity.
 *
 * For these reasons, HashedItemStore doesn't concern itself with this constraint.
