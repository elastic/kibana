/**
 * State syncing utilities are a set of helpers for syncing your application state
 * with browser URL or browser storage.
 *
 * They are designed to work together with {@link https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/src/plugins/kibana_utils/docs/state_containers | state containers}. But state containers are not required.
 *
 * State syncing utilities include:
 *
 * *{@link syncState} util which:
 *   * Subscribes to state changes and pushes them to state storage.
 *   * Optionally subscribes to state storage changes and pushes them to state.
 *   * Two types of storages compatible with `syncState`:
 *   * {@link IKbnUrlStateStorage} - Serializes state and persists it to URL's query param in rison or hashed format.
 * Listens for state updates in the URL and pushes them back to state.
 *   * {@link ISessionStorageStateStorage} - Serializes state and persists it to browser storage.
 *
 * Refer {@link https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/src/plugins/kibana_utils/docs/state_sync | here} for a complete guide and examples.
