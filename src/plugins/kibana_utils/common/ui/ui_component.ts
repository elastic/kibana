 * In many places in Kibana we want to be agnostic to frontend view library,

 * are orthogonal to any rendering library. This interface represents such UI
 * components. UI component receives a DOM element and `props` through `render()`
 * method, the `render()` method can be called many times.
 *
 * Although Kibana aims to be library agnostic, Kibana itself is written in React,
 * thus here we define `UiComponent` which is an abstract unit of UI that can be
 * implemented in any framework, but it maps easily to React components, i.e.
 * `UiComponent<Props>` is like `React.ComponentType<Props>`.
