  <h3>Provide some sample logs</h3>
  Paste in one or more lines from the file you intend to tail. We'll use these samples in the following steps to help
  you build an ingest pipeline and configure a Kibana index pattern. Log lines can be raw strings or
  formatted as JSON. If your logs are raw strings but you intend to use
  <a target="_window" ng-href="{{pasteStep.docLinks.exportedFields}}">Filebeat's metadata</a>,
  you'll want to paste the JSON as it will come out of Filebeat.
