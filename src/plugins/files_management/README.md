# Files management

Minimal interface for admins to manage files in Kibana.


## Notes

This UI is intended to become part of the Kibana Content Management UI. This will
be a broader user-experience than only files, i.e., aimed at "content" more generally.

Do not add new file-specific features that does not fit with this vision.
