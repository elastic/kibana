## Introduction

The Controls plugin contains Embeddables which can be used to add user-friendly interactivity to apps.

The Control group is an embeddable container which provides the ability to add, remove, reorder, and edit multiple types of control embeddable. In any implementation, the control group embeddable should be the main point of contact between the application and the controls. The list of filters it sends to its output observable should be considered the final output of the current state of the controls, and can then be sent to other embeddables, or combined with filters from other sources.
