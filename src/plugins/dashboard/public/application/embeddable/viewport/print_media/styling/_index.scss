/*
This styling contains utility and minimal layout styles to help plugins create
print-ready HTML.

Observations:
1. We currently do not control the user-agent's header and footer content
   (including the style of fonts) for client-side printing.

2. Page box model is quite different from what we have in browsers - page
   margins define where the "no-mans-land" exists for actual content. Moving
   content into this space by, for example setting negative margins resulted
   in slightly unpredictable behaviour because the browser wants to either
   move this content to another page or it may get split across two
   pages.

3. page-break-* is your friend!

// Currently we cannot control or style the content the browser places in
// margins, this might change in the future:
// See https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/#margin-boxes
@page {
  size: A4;
  orientation: portrait;
  margin: 0;
  margin-top: $a4PageHeaderHeight;
  margin-bottom: $a4PageFooterHeight;
}

@media print {

  html {
    background-color: #FFF;
  }

  // It is good practice to show the full URL in the final, printed output
  a[href]:after {
    content: ' [' attr(href) ']';
  }

  figure {
    page-break-inside: avoid;
  }

  * {
    print-color-adjust: exact !important;
  }

}
