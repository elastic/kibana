<h3>Welcome to Console</h3>

<h4>Quick intro to the UI</h4>

<p>The Console UI is split into two panes: an editor pane (left) and a response pane (right).
  Use the editor to type requests and submit them to Elasticsearch. The results will be displayed in
  the response pane on the right side.
</p>

<p>Console understands requests in a compact format, similar to cURL:
<sense-help-example></sense-help-example>

<p>While typing a request, Console will make suggestions which you can than accept by hitting Enter/Tab.
  These suggestions are made based on the request structure <i>as well as</i> your indices and types.
</p>


<h4>A few quick tips, while I have your attention</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Submit requests to ES using the green triangle button.</li>
  <li>Use the wrench menu for other useful things.</li>
  <li>You can paste requests in cURL format and they will be translated to the Console syntax.</li>
  <li>You can resize the editor and output panes by dragging the separator between them.</li>
  <li>Study the keyboard shortcuts under the Help button. Good stuff in there!</li>
</ul>
