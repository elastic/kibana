## Introduction

The Presentation Utility Plugin is a set of common, shared components and toolkits for solutions within the Presentation space, (e.g. Dashboards, Canvas).

## Plugin Services Toolkit

While Kibana provides a `useKibana` hook for use in a plugin, the number of services it provides is very large.  This presents a set of difficulties:

- a direct dependency upon the Kibana environment;
- a requirement to mock the full Kibana environment when testing or using Storybook;
- a lack of knowledge as to what services are being consumed at any given time.

To mitigate these difficulties, the Presentation Team creates services within the plugin that then consume Kibana-provided (or other) services.  This is a toolkit for creating simple services within a plugin.

### Overview

- A `PluginServiceFactory` is a function that will return a set of functions-- which comprise a `Service`-- given a set of parameters.
- A `PluginServiceProvider` is an object that use a factory to start, stop or provide a `Service`.
- A `PluginServiceRegistry` is a collection of providers for a given environment, (e.g. Kibana, Jest, Storybook, stub, etc).
- A `PluginServices` object uses a registry to provide services throughout the plugin.

### Defining Services

To start, a plugin should define a set of services it wants to provide to itself or other plugins.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Service Definition Example" initialIsOpen>
```ts
export interface PresentationDashboardsService {
  findDashboards: (
    query: string,
    fields: string[]
  ) => Promise<Array<SimpleSavedObject<DashboardSavedObject>>>;
  findDashboardsByTitle: (title: string) => Promise<Array<SimpleSavedObject<DashboardSavedObject>>>;
}

export interface PresentationFooService {
  getFoo: () => string;
  setFoo: (bar: string) => void;
}

export interface PresentationUtilServices {
  dashboards: PresentationDashboardsService;
  foo: PresentationFooService;
}
```
</DocAccordion>

This definition will be used in the toolkit to ensure services are complete and as expected.

### Plugin Services

The `PluginServices` class hosts a registry of service providers from which a plugin can access its services.  It uses the service definition as a generic.

```ts
export const pluginServices = new PluginServices<PresentationUtilServices>();
```

This can be placed in the `index.ts` file of a `services` directory within your plugin.

Once created, it simply requires a `PluginServiceRegistry` to be started and set.

### Service Provider Registry

Each environment in which components are used requires a `PluginServiceRegistry` to specify how the providers are started.  For example, simple stubs of services require no parameters to start, (so the `StartParameters` generic remains unspecified)

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Stubbed Service Registry Example" initialIsOpen>
```ts
export const providers: PluginServiceProviders<PresentationUtilServices> = {
  dashboards: new PluginServiceProvider(dashboardsServiceFactory),
  foo: new PluginServiceProvider(fooServiceFactory),
};

export const serviceRegistry = new PluginServiceRegistry<PresentationUtilServices>(providers);
```
</DocAccordion>

By contrast, a registry that uses Kibana can provide `KibanaPluginServiceParams` to determine how to start its providers, so the `StartParameters` generic is given:

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Kibana Service Registry Example" initialIsOpen>
```ts
export const providers: PluginServiceProviders<
  PresentationUtilServices,
  KibanaPluginServiceParams<PresentationUtilPluginStart>
> = {
  dashboards: new PluginServiceProvider(dashboardsServiceFactory),
  foo: new PluginServiceProvider(fooServiceFactory),
};

export const serviceRegistry = new PluginServiceRegistry<
  PresentationUtilServices,
  KibanaPluginServiceParams<PresentationUtilPluginStart>
>(providers);
```
</DocAccordion>

### Service Provider

A `PluginServiceProvider` is a container for a Service Factory that is responsible for starting, stopping and providing a service implementation.  A Service Provider doesn't change, rather the factory and the relevant `StartParameters` change.

### Service Factories

A Service Factory is nothing more than a function that uses `StartParameters` to return a set of functions that conforms to a portion of the `Services` specification.  For each service, a factory is provided for each environment.

Given a service definition:

```ts
export interface PresentationFooService {
  getFoo: () => string;
  setFoo: (bar: string) => void;
}
```

a factory for a stubbed version might look like this:

```ts
type FooServiceFactory = PluginServiceFactory<PresentationFooService>;

export const fooServiceFactory: FooServiceFactory = () => ({
  getFoo: () => 'bar',
  setFoo: (bar) => { console.log(`${bar} set!`)},
});
```

and a factory for a Kibana version might look like this:

```ts
export type FooServiceFactory = KibanaPluginServiceFactory<
  PresentationFooService,
  PresentationUtilPluginStart
>;

export const fooServiceFactory: FooServiceFactory = ({
  coreStart,
  startPlugins,
}) => {
  // ...do something with Kibana services...

  return {
    getFoo: //...
    setFoo: //...
  }
}
```

### Using Services

Once your services and providers are defined, and you have at least one set of factories, you can use `PluginServices` to provide the services to your React components:

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Services starting in a plugin" initialIsOpen>
```ts
// plugin.ts
import { pluginServices } from './services';
import { registry } from './services/kibana';

  public start(
    coreStart: CoreStart,
    startPlugins: StartDeps
  ): Promise<PresentationUtilPluginStart> {
    pluginServices.setRegistry(registry.start({ coreStart, startPlugins }));
    return {};
  }
```
</DocAccordion>

and wrap your root React component with the `PluginServices` context:

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Providing services in a React context" initialIsOpen>
```ts
import { pluginServices } from './services';

const ContextProvider = pluginServices.getContextProvider(),

return(
  <I18nContext>
    <WhateverElse>
      <ContextProvider>{application}</ContextProvider>
    </WhateverElse>
  </I18nContext>
)
```
</DocAccordion>

and then, consume your services using provided hooks in a component:

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Consuming services in a component" initialIsOpen>
```ts
// component.ts

import { pluginServices } from '../services';

export function MyComponent() {
  // Retrieve all context hooks from `PluginServices`, destructuring for the one we're using
  const { foo } = pluginServices.getHooks();

  // Use the `useContext` hook to access the API.
  const { getFoo } = foo.useService();

  // ...
}
```
</DocAccordion>

## Redux Embeddables
The Redux Embeddables system allows embeddable authors to interact with their embeddables in a standardized way using Redux toolkit. This wrapper abstracts away store and slice creation, embeddable input sync, and context creation. To use this system, a developer can wrap their components in the ReduxEmbeddableWrapper, supplying only an object of reducers.

### Reducers
The reducer object expected by the ReduxEmbeddableWrapper is the same type as the reducers expected by [Redux Toolkit's CreateSlice](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice).

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Reducers Example" initialIsOpen>
```ts
// my_embeddable_reducers.ts
import { MyEmbeddableInput } from './my_embeddable';

export const myEmbeddableReducers = {
  setSpecialBoolean: (
    state: WritableDraft<MyEmbeddableInput>,
    action: PayloadAction<MyEmbeddableInput['specialBoolean']>
  ) => {
    state.specialBoolean = action.payload;
  }
}
    
```
</DocAccordion>

### Lazy Component and Types
Because the ReduxEmbeddableWrapper is a lazy component, it also must be unwrapped with the `withSuspense` component from Presentation Util. When you await this component, you must also pass in the type information so that the redux store and actions are properly typed.
 
 <DocAccordion buttonContent="Awaiting LazyReduxEmbeddableWrapper" initialIsOpen>
  ```ts
  // my_embeddable.tsx

  import {
    withSuspense,
    LazyReduxEmbeddableWrapper,
    ReduxEmbeddableWrapperPropsWithChildren,
  } from '../../../../presentation_util/public';

  export interface MyEmbeddableInput {
    specialBoolean: boolean
  }

  const MyEmbeddableReduxWrapper = withSuspense<
    ReduxEmbeddableWrapperPropsWithChildren<MyEmbeddableInput>
  >(LazyReduxEmbeddableWrapper);
      
  ```
</DocAccordion>

The ReduxEmbeddableWrapper should be used inside of embeddable classes, and should wrap all components under the embeddable in the render function.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Wrapping Embeddable Render" initialIsOpen>
  ```ts
  // my_embeddable.tsx

  public render(dom: HTMLElement) {
    if (this.domNode) ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(this.domNode);
    this.domNode = dom;
    ReactDOM.render(
        <MyEmbeddableReduxWrapper embeddable={this} reducers={myEmbeddableReducers}>
          <MyEmbeddableComponent />
        </MyEmbeddableReduxWrapper>,
      dom
    );
  }
  ```
</DocAccordion>

### Accessing Actions and State

From components under the embeddable, actions, containerActions, and the current state of the redux store are accessed via the ReduxEmbeddableContext. This context requires the input type and the type of the reducers, and will return the appropriately typed actions, a hook for dispatching actions, a selector to get the current redux state, and a suite of `containerActions` if the embeddable is a Container.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Accessing Redux Embeddable Context" initialIsOpen>
  ```ts
  // my_embeddable_component.tsx
  import { useReduxEmbeddableContext } from '../../../../presentation_util/public';

  const {
    useEmbeddableSelector,
    useEmbeddableDispatch,
    actions: { setSpecialBoolean },
  } = useReduxEmbeddableContext<
    MyEmbeddableInput,
    typeof myEmbeddableReducers
  >();

  const dispatch = useEmbeddableDispatch();

  // current state
  const { specialBoolean } = useEmbeddableSelector((state) => state);

  // change specialBoolean after 5 seconds
  setTimeout(() => dispatch(setSpecialBoolean(false)), 5000);
  ```
