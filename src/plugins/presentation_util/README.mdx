## Introduction

The Presentation Utility Plugin is a set of common, shared components and toolkits for solutions within the Presentation space, (e.g. Dashboards, Canvas).

## Plugin Services Toolkit

While Kibana provides a `useKibana` hook for use in a plugin, the number of services it provides is very large.  This presents a set of difficulties:

- a direct dependency upon the Kibana environment;
- a requirement to mock the full Kibana environment when testing or using Storybook;
- a lack of knowledge as to what services are being consumed at any given time.

To mitigate these difficulties, the Presentation Team creates services within the plugin that then consume Kibana-provided (or other) services.  This is a toolkit for creating simple services within a plugin.

### Overview

- A `PluginServiceFactory` is a function that will return a set of functions-- which comprise a `Service`-- given a set of parameters.
- A `PluginServiceProvider` is an object that use a factory to start, stop or provide a `Service`.
- A `PluginServiceRegistry` is a collection of providers for a given environment, (e.g. Kibana, Jest, Storybook, stub, etc).
- A `PluginServices` object uses a registry to provide services throughout the plugin.

### Defining Services

To start, a plugin should define a set of services it wants to provide to itself or other plugins.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Service Definition Example" initialIsOpen>
```ts
export interface PresentationDashboardsService {
  findDashboards: (
    query: string,
    fields: string[]
  ) => Promise<Array<SimpleSavedObject<DashboardSavedObject>>>;
  findDashboardsByTitle: (title: string) => Promise<Array<SimpleSavedObject<DashboardSavedObject>>>;
}

export interface PresentationFooService {
  getFoo: () => string;
  setFoo: (bar: string) => void;
}

export interface PresentationUtilServices {
  dashboards: PresentationDashboardsService;
  foo: PresentationFooService;
}
```
</DocAccordion>

This definition will be used in the toolkit to ensure services are complete and as expected.

### Plugin Services

The `PluginServices` class hosts a registry of service providers from which a plugin can access its services.  It uses the service definition as a generic.

```ts
export const pluginServices = new PluginServices<PresentationUtilServices>();
```

This can be placed in the `index.ts` file of a `services` directory within your plugin.

Once created, it simply requires a `PluginServiceRegistry` to be started and set.

### Service Provider Registry

Each environment in which components are used requires a `PluginServiceRegistry` to specify how the providers are started.  For example, simple stubs of services require no parameters to start, (so the `StartParameters` generic remains unspecified)

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Stubbed Service Registry Example" initialIsOpen>
```ts
export const providers: PluginServiceProviders<PresentationUtilServices> = {
  dashboards: new PluginServiceProvider(dashboardsServiceFactory),
  foo: new PluginServiceProvider(fooServiceFactory),
};

export const serviceRegistry = new PluginServiceRegistry<PresentationUtilServices>(providers);
```
</DocAccordion>

By contrast, a registry that uses Kibana can provide `KibanaPluginServiceParams` to determine how to start its providers, so the `StartParameters` generic is given:

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Kibana Service Registry Example" initialIsOpen>
```ts
export const providers: PluginServiceProviders<
  PresentationUtilServices,
  KibanaPluginServiceParams<PresentationUtilPluginStart>
> = {
  dashboards: new PluginServiceProvider(dashboardsServiceFactory),
  foo: new PluginServiceProvider(fooServiceFactory),
};

export const serviceRegistry = new PluginServiceRegistry<
  PresentationUtilServices,
  KibanaPluginServiceParams<PresentationUtilPluginStart>
>(providers);
```
</DocAccordion>

### Service Provider

A `PluginServiceProvider` is a container for a Service Factory that is responsible for starting, stopping and providing a service implementation.  A Service Provider doesn't change, rather the factory and the relevant `StartParameters` change.

### Service Factories

A Service Factory is nothing more than a function that uses `StartParameters` to return a set of functions that conforms to a portion of the `Services` specification.  For each service, a factory is provided for each environment.

Given a service definition:

```ts
export interface PresentationFooService {
  getFoo: () => string;
  setFoo: (bar: string) => void;
}
```

a factory for a stubbed version might look like this:

```ts
type FooServiceFactory = PluginServiceFactory<PresentationFooService>;

export const fooServiceFactory: FooServiceFactory = () => ({
  getFoo: () => 'bar',
  setFoo: (bar) => { console.log(`${bar} set!`)},
});
```

and a factory for a Kibana version might look like this:

```ts
export type FooServiceFactory = KibanaPluginServiceFactory<
  PresentationFooService,
  PresentationUtilPluginStart
>;

export const fooServiceFactory: FooServiceFactory = ({
  coreStart,
  startPlugins,
}) => {
  // ...do something with Kibana services...

  return {
    getFoo: //...
    setFoo: //...
  }
}
```

### Using Services

Once your services and providers are defined, and you have at least one set of factories, you can use `PluginServices` to provide the services to your React components:

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Services starting in a plugin" initialIsOpen>
```ts
// plugin.ts
import { pluginServices } from './services';
import { registry } from './services/kibana';

  public async start(
    coreStart: CoreStart,
    startPlugins: StartDeps
  ): Promise<PresentationUtilPluginStart> {
    pluginServices.setRegistry(registry.start({ coreStart, startPlugins }));
    return {};
  }
```
</DocAccordion>

and wrap your root React component with the `PluginServices` context:

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Providing services in a React context" initialIsOpen>
```ts
import { pluginServices } from './services';

const ContextProvider = pluginServices.getContextProvider(),

return(
  <I18nContext>
    <WhateverElse>
      <ContextProvider>{application}</ContextProvider>
    </WhateverElse>
  </I18nContext>
)
```
</DocAccordion>

and then, consume your services using provided hooks in a component:

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Consuming services in a component" initialIsOpen>
```ts
// component.ts

import { pluginServices } from '../services';

export function MyComponent() {
  // Retrieve all context hooks from `PluginServices`, destructuring for the one we're using
  const { foo } = pluginServices.getHooks();

  // Use the `useContext` hook to access the API.
  const { getFoo } = foo.useService();

  // ...
}
```
</DocAccordion>
