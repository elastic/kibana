## Introduction

The Presentation Utility Plugin is a set of common, shared components and toolkits for solutions within the Presentation space, (e.g. Dashboards, Canvas).

## Redux Embeddables

The Redux Embeddables system allows embeddable authors to interact with their embeddables in a standardized way using Redux toolkit. This wrapper abstracts away store and slice creation, and embeddable input sync. To use this system, a developer can use CreateReduxEmbeddableTools in the constructor of their embeddable, supplying a collection of reducers.

### Reducers

The reducer object expected by the ReduxEmbeddableWrapper is the same type as the reducers expected by [Redux Toolkit's CreateSlice](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice).

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Reducers Example" initialIsOpen>
```ts
// my_embeddable_reducers.ts
import { MyEmbeddableInput } from './my_embeddable';

export const myEmbeddableReducers = {
  setSpecialBoolean: (
    state: WritableDraft<MyEmbeddableInput>,
    action: PayloadAction<MyEmbeddableInput['specialBoolean']>
  ) => {
    state.specialBoolean = action.payload;
  }
}
    
```
</DocAccordion>

### Accessing Actions and State

From components under the embeddable, actions, containerActions, and the current state of the redux store are accessed via the embeddable instance. You can pass the embeddable instance down as a prop, or use a context.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Accessing Redux Embeddable Context" initialIsOpen>
  ```ts
  // my_embeddable_component.tsx
  const MyEmbeddableComponent = ({ embeddableInstance }: { embeddableInstance: IEmbeddable }) => {
    // current state
    const specialBoolean = embeddableInstance.select((state) => state.specialBoolean);

    // change specialBoolean after 5 seconds
    setTimeout(() => embeddableInstance.dispatch.setSpecialBoolean(false), 5000);

}

```
</DocAccordion>
