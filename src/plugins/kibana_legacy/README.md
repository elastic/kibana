# kibana-legacy

This plugin contains several helpers and services to integrate pieces of the legacy Kibana app with the new Kibana platform.

This plugin will be removed once all parts of legacy Kibana are removed from other plugins.

All of this plugin should be considered deprecated. New code should never integrate with the services provided from this plugin.
