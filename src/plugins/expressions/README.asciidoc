== `expressions` plugin

Expression pipeline is a chain of functions that *pipe* its output to the
input of the next function. Functions can be configured using arguments provided
by the user. The final output of the expression pipeline can be rendered using
one of the *renderers* registered in `expressions` plugin.

All the arguments to expression functions need to be serializable, as well as input and output.
Expression functions should try to stay 'pure'. This makes functions easy to reuse and also 
make it possible to serialize the whole chain as well as output at every step of execution.

Expressions power visualizations in Dashboard and Lens, as well as, every
*element* in Canvas is backed by an expression.

This plugin provides methods which will parse & execute an *expression pipeline*
string for you, as well as a series of registries for advanced users who might
want to incorporate their own functions, types, and renderers into the service
for use in their own application.

=== Examples

Below is an example of serialized expression for one Canvas element that fetches 
data using `essql` function, pipes it further to `math` and `metric` functions, 
and final `render` function renders the result.

| essql
  query="SELECT COUNT(timestamp) as total_errors
    FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
    WHERE tags LIKE '%warning%' OR tags LIKE '%error%'"
