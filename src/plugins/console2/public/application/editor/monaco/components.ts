/**
 * This class is responsible for acting as an abstraction layer between consumers
 * and whatever editor implementation we are using. It should consist only of the methods
 * we find useful for an editor to have, like:
 *
 * - Registering a lang
 * - Registering autocompletion
 * - Getting the current content of the editor
 *
 * The fact that we use Monaco should, in as far as possible, be an implementation detail.
