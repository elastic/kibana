**Returns:** `boolean`

There might be cases where you need to know if the form has been modified by the user. For example: the user is about to leave the form after making some changes, you might want to show a modal indicating that the changes will be lost.

For that you can use the `useFormIsModified` hook which will update each time any of the field value changes. If the user makes a change and then undoes the change and puts the initial value back, the form **won't be marked** as modified.

**Important:** If you form dynamically adds and removes fields, the `isModified` state will be set to `true` when a field is removed from the DOM **only** if it was declared in the form initial `defaultValue` object.

## Options

### form

**Type:** `FormHook`  

The form hook object. It is only required to provide the form hook object in your **root form component**. 

```js
const RootFormComponent = () => {
  // root form component, where the form object is declared
  const { form } = useForm();
  const isModified = useFormIsModified({ form });

  return (
    <Form form={form}>
      <ChildComponent />
    </Form>
  );
};

const ChildComponent = () => {
  const isModified = useFormIsModified(); // no need to provide the form object
  return (
    <div>...</div>
  );
};
```

### discard

**Type:** `string[]`  

If there are certain fields that you want to discard when checking if the form has been modified you can provide an array of field paths to the `discard` option.
