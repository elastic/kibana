When a plugin moves to "full screen" mode, the Kibana Chrome can be hidden entirely.  This button floats over the plugin workspace and allows someone to exit full screen mode and restore the Kibana Chrome.

The pure component, `exit_full_screen_button.tsx`, contains the base styles and behaviors.

The connected component, `exit_full_screen_button.tsx`, uses services from the `shared_ux` plugin to show and hide the Kibana chrome.  You must wrap your plugin app in the `ServicesContext` provided by the start contract of the `shared_ux` plugin to use it.

This component is provided with `React.lazy` to avoid bundle bloat.

This component is not currently eligible for promotion to EUI.
