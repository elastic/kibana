## Description

This component is meant to be used in scenarios when there is no data in Elasticsearch, or there haven't been any data views created yet, in Analytics apps. 
It displays an appropriate message to the user and facilitate addition of integrations and creation of data views. The screens have been preconfigured with the Analytics-specific messages.
If a more generic version of the component is needed, `KibanaNoDataPage` from `shared-ux-components` should be used instead

## Component: `AnalyticsNoDataPage`

- an Analytics-specific wrapper around `KibanaNoDataPage`
- uses `hasUserDataView` and `hasData` API from `HasData` service in `data_views` plugin to check for existence of data / data views
- uses `onDataViewCreated` callback to be called once the data view has been created
- is wrapped in `ServicesContext` provided by the start contract of the `shared_ux` plugin
