    This component aims to insert assertive live region on the page,
    to make sure that a screen reader announces layout changes.

    Due to the fact that it has a specific way of detecting what-and-when announce
    as well as delay of announcement (which depends on what a user is doing at the moment)
    I place a 500ms delay of re-render the text of anouncement.
    That time period is best fits the time of screen reader reaction.
    That anouncement depends on what user is typying into search box as well as
    the speed of ordinary screen reader pronouns what user is typing before start reading this anouncement.

    The order of triggering functions:
    1: React trigs the component to be updated
    2: It places a timer and block render
    3: The time is over
    4: Component renders

    5: If there is another component call, the timer is dropped (cleared).
