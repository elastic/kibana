            Tweaks you make here can break large portions of Kibana.
            Some of these settings may be undocumented, unsupported or experimental.
            If a field has a default value, blanking the field will reset it to its default which may be
            unacceptable given other configuration directives.
            Deleting a custom setting will permanently remove it from Kibana's config."
