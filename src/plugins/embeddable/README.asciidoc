== Embeddables plugin

Embeddables are re-usable widgets that can be rendered in any environment or plugin. Developers can embed them directly in their plugin. End users can dynamically add them to any embeddable _containers_.

=== Embeddable containers

Containers are a special type of embeddable that can contain nested embeddables. Embeddables can be dynamically added to embeddable _containers_. Currently only dashboard uses this interface.

=== Examples

Many example embeddables are implemented and registered https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/examples/embeddable_examples[here]. They can be played around with and explored https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/examples/embeddable_explorer[in the Embeddable Explorer example plugin]. Just run kibana with

[source,sh]
--
yarn start --run-examples
--

and navigate to the Embeddable explorer app.

There is also an example of rendering dashboard container outside of dashboard app https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/examples/dashboard_embeddable_examples[here].
