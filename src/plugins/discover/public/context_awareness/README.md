# Discover context awareness

**If you're looking for available extension point definitions, they're located in the `Profile` interface in [`types.ts`](types.ts).**

## Summary

The Discover context awareness framework allows Discover's UI and functionality to adapt to the surrounding context of the page, including solution type, data source, current search parameters, etc., in order to provide curated data exploration experiences across a variety of data types and scenarios. Support for this is implemented through a system of profiles that map to distinct context levels, and extension points that provide interfaces for customizing specific aspects of Discover.

## Concepts

### Context levels

There are currently three context levels supported in Discover:

- Root context:
  - Based on the current solution type.
  - Resolved at application initialization.
  - Runs synchronously or asynchronously.
- Data source context:
  - Based on the current ES|QL query or data view.
  - Resolved on ES|QL query or data view change, before data fetching occurs.
  - Runs synchronously or asynchronously.
- Document context:
  - Based on individual ES|QL records or ES documents.
  - Resolved individually for each ES|QL record or ES document after data fetching runs.
  - Runs synchronously only.

### Composable profiles

Discover uses a concept called "composable profiles" to support context awareness. Composable profiles are implementations of a core `Profile` interface (or a subset of it) containing all of the available extension points Discover supports. A composable profile can be implemented at any context level through a "profile provider", responsible for defining the composable profile and its associated context resolution method, called `resolve`. Each provider's `resolve` method is passed a parameters object specific to its context level, which it uses to determine if its associated `profile` is a match. In cases where it is a match, the `resolve` method also returns related metadata in a `context` object.

Within Discover there is always one resolved root profile, one resolved data source profile (as long as search results exist), and a resolved document profile for each search result in the data grid. Profile providers have access to the `context` objects of higher level providers within their `resolve` method (`root` > `data source` > `document`), making it possible to create context-dependent profiles. For example, an `oblt-logs-data-source` profile which is used when the current solution type is Observability, and the current data source contains logs data.

Definitions for the core `Profile` interface are located in the [`types.ts`](types.ts) file.

Definitions for the available profile provider types are located in the [`profiles`](./profiles) folder.

### Merged accessors

Composable profiles operate similarly to middleware in that each of their extension point implementations are passed a `prev` argument, which can be called to access the results from profiles at previous context levels, and allows overwriting or composing a final result from the previous results. The function Discover calls to trigger the extension point merging process and obtain a final result from the combined profiles is referred to as a "merged accessor".

The merging order for profiles is based on the context level hierarchy (`root` > `data source` > `document`), meaning the root profile is passed a base implementation as its `prev` argument, the data source profile is passed the root implementation as `prev` (if one exists, otherwise the base implementation), and document profiles are passed the data source implementation as `prev` (if one exists, otherwise the root or base implementation).

The following diagram illustrates the extension point merging process:

Definitions for composable profiles and the merging routine are located in the [`composable_profile.ts`](./composable_profile.ts) file.

### Supporting services

The context awareness framework is driven by two main supporting services called `ProfileService` and `ProfilesManager`.

Each context level has a dedicated profile service, e.g. `RootProfileService`, which is responsible for accepting profile provider registrations and looping over each provider in order during context resolution to identify a matching profile. Each resolution call can result in only one matching profile, which is the first to return a match based on execution order.

A single `ProfilesManager` is instantiated on Discover load, or one per saved search panel in a dashboard. The profiles manager is responsible for the following:

- Managing state associated with the current Discover context.
- Coordinating profile services and exposing resolution methods for each context level.
- Providing access to the combined set of resolved profiles.
- Deduplicating profile resolution attempts with identical parameters.
- Error handling and fallback behaviour on profile resolution failure.

`ProfileService` definitions and implementation are located in the [`profiles_service.ts`](./profile_service.ts) file.

The `ProfilesManager` implementation is located in the [`profiles_manager.ts`](./profiles_manager.ts) file.

### Putting it all together

The following diagram models the overall Discover context awareness framework and how each of the above concepts come together:

## Code organization

One of the core ideas of the context awareness framework is that Discover is still a single application which should know about which profiles it supports and directly import the code needed to support them. This is why profile registrations are all handled internally to the plugin instead of having a registration system exposed through the plugin contract. This approach comes with several main benefits:

- There is a single, central place where all profile registrations happen, which is much easier to maintan versus scattered registrations.
- The Data Discovery team remains aware of which profiles exist and what changes are made. This is critical to ensure the Data Discovery team is able to provide adequate customer and SDH support for Discover.
- Common code and utilities can be easily shared across profiles since they need to be accessible to Discover by default, rather than being scattered throughout various plugin codebases.

It also comes with an important drawback: **Discover cannot depend on other plugins (e.g. solution plugins) to import code for profiles due to the dependency graph issues it would create.**

This means that in an ideal situation, the code for Discover profiles should either live directly within the Discover codebase, or within dedicated packages which Discover imports from:

- When adding solution specific code directly to the Discover codebase, it should be done in an organized way in order to support shared ownership. For example, the [`profile_providers/security`](./profile_providers/security) folder contains code specific to Security Solution maintained profiles, and an override has been added to the [`CODEOWNERS`](/.github/CODEOWNERS) file to reflect the shared ownership of this folder.
- When creating a dedicated package for some profile code, the maintaining team can retain full ownership over the package, and Discover is only responsible for importing the functionality and adding it to the associated profile registration.

There are situations where neither of the above two options are viable, such as when migrating large pieces of functionality from a solution plugin to a Discover profile, which could be time consuming and involve moving huge amounts of code to packages. For these situations, there's a [discover_shared](/src/plugins/discover_shared) plugin specifically to support inversion of control for Discover profile features (see the [`README`](/src/plugins/discover_shared/README.md) for more details).

By ensuring all Discover profiles use the same IoC mechanism, changes or improvements to the system can be centralized, and areas that use it can easily be located. In general, this should be used as a last resort when the benefits of importing directly from packages aren't worth the effort to migrate the code, and ideally teams who use it should have a plan to later refactor the code into packages.

## Registering a profile

In order to register a Discover profile, follow these steps:

1. Identify at which [context level](#context-levels) your profile should be implemented.
2. Create a subfolder for your profile provider within the [`profile_providers`](./profile_providers) folder. Common Discover providers should be created within the `profile_providers/common` subfolder, while solution specific providers should be created within a `profile_providers/{SOLUTION_TYPE}` subfolder, e.g. `profile_providers/security/security_root_profile`.
3. Create a `profile.ts(x)` file within your provider subfolder that exports a factory function which optionally accepts a `ProfileProviderServices` parameter and returns your provider implementation, e.g. `createSecurityRootProfileProvider(services: ProfileProviderServices) => RootProfileProvider`.
4. **If your provider is not ready for GA or should only be enabled for specific configurations, make sure to set the `isExperimental` flag to `true` in your profile provider.** This will ensure the profile is disabled by default, and can be enabled in `kibana.yml` like this: `discover.experimental.enabledProfiles: [{YOUR_PROFILE_ID}]`.
5. Call and return the result of your provider factory function from the corresponding factory function in [`register_profile_providers.ts`](./profile_providers/register_profile_providers.ts), e.g. `createRootProfileProviders`. The order of providers in the returned array determines the execution order during context resolution.

Existing providers can be extended using the [`extendProfileProvider`](./profile_providers/extend_profile_provider.ts) utility, allowing multiple sub profiles to be composed from a shared parent profile.

Example profile provider implementations are located in [`profile_providers/example`](./profile_providers/example).

## Example implementation

// Export profile provider factory function, optionally accepting ProfileProviderServices,
// and returning a profile provider for a specific context level
export const createExampleDataSourceProfileProvider = (
  services: ProfileProviderServices
): DataSourceProfileProvider => ({
  // All profiles must have a unique ID
  profileId: 'example-data-source-profile',

  // Set isExperimental flag to true if profile should be disabled by default
  isExperimental: true,

  // The composable profile definition
  profile: {
    // Each available method maps to a Discover extension point
    getCellRenderers: (prev) => () => ({
      // Calling prev() provides access to results from previous context levels,
      // making it possible to compose a result from multiple profiles
      ...prev(),

      // Extend the previous results with a cell renderer for the message field
      message: (props) => {
        const message = getFieldValue(props.row, 'message');
        return <span>Custom message cell: {message}</span>;
      },
    }),
  },

  // The method responsible for context resolution,
  // passed a params object with props specific to the context level,
  // as well as providing access to higher level context objects
  resolve: (params) => {
    let indexPattern: string | undefined;

    // Extract the index pattern from the current ES|QL query or data view
    if (isDataSourceType(params.dataSource, DataSourceType.Esql)) {
      if (!isOfAggregateQueryType(params.query)) {
        return { isMatch: false };
      }

      indexPattern = getIndexPatternFromESQLQuery(params.query.esql);
    } else if (isDataSourceType(params.dataSource, DataSourceType.DataView) && params.dataView) {
      indexPattern = params.dataView.getIndexPattern();
    }

    // If the profile is not a match, return isMatch: false in the result
    if (indexPattern !== 'my-example-logs') {
      return { isMatch: false };
    }

    // If the profile is a match, return isMatch: true in the result,
    // plus a context object containing details of the current context
    return {
      isMatch: true,
      context: { category: DataSourceCategory.Logs },
    };
  },
});

/**
 * profile_providers/register_profile_providers.ts
 */

// Locate the factory function for the matching context level
const createDataSourceProfileProviders = (providerServices: ProfileProviderServices) => [
  // Call the profile provider factory function and return its result in the array
  createExampleDataSourceProfileProvider(providerServices),
  ...createLogsDataSourceProfileProviders(providerServices),
];

/**
 * Navigate to Discover and execute the following ES|QL query
 * to resolve the profile: `FROM my-example-logs`
 */
```
