    // to preserve the functionality from #35262 we need to get the injector here just for kbnUrl.

    // 2019-12-01 The usage of kbnUrl had to be removed due to the transition to NP.
    // It's now temporarily replaced by a simple replace of the single argument used by all URLs.
    // Once kbnUrl is migrated to NP, this can be updated.
