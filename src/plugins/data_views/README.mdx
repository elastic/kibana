# Data Views

The data views API provides a consistent method of structuring and formatting documents
and field lists across the various Kibana apps. Its typically used in conjunction with
<DocLink id="kibDevTutorialDataSearchAndSessions" section="high-level-search" text="SearchSource" /> for composing queries.

*Note: Kibana index patterns are currently being renamed to data views. There will be some naming inconsistencies until the transition is complete.*

### Services

**hasData:** A standardized way to check the empty state for indices and data views.
- `hasESData: () => Promise<boolean>; // Check to see if ES data exists`
- `hasDataView: () => Promise<boolean>; // Check to see if data view exists (managed or user created)`
- `hasUserDataView: () => Promise<boolean>; // Check to see if user created data views exists`
