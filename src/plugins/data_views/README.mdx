# Data Views

The data views API provides a consistent method of structuring and formatting documents
and field lists across the various Kibana apps. Its typically used in conjunction with
<DocLink id="kibDevTutorialDataSearchAndSessions" section="high-level-search" text="SearchSource" /> for composing queries.

*Note: Kibana index patterns are currently being renamed to data views. There will be some naming inconsistencies until the transition is complete.*
