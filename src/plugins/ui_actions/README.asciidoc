== UI Actions

UI Actions plugins provides API to manage *triggers* and *actions*.

*Trigger* is an abstract description of user's intent to perform an action
(like user clicking on a value inside chart). It allows us to do runtime
binding between code from different plugins. For, example one such
trigger is when somebody applies filters on dashboard; another one is when
somebody opens a Dashboard panel context menu.

*Actions* are pieces of code that execute in response to a trigger. For example,
to the dashboard filtering trigger multiple actions can be attached. Once a user
filters on the dashboard all possible actions are displayed to the user in a
popup menu and the user has to chose one.

In general this plugin provides:

- Creating custom functionality (actions).
- Creating custom user interaction events (triggers).
- Attaching and detaching actions to triggers.
- Emitting trigger events.
- Executing actions attached to a given trigger.
- Exposing a context menu for the user to choose the appropriate action when there are multiple actions attached to a single trigger.

=== Basic usage

To get started, first you need to know a trigger you will attach your actions to.
You can either pick an existing one, or register your own one:

[source,typescript jsx]
----
plugins.uiActions.registerTrigger({
  id: 'MY_APP_PIE_CHART_CLICK',
  title: 'Pie chart click',
  description: 'When user clicks on a pie chart slice.',
});
----

Now, when user clicks on a pie slice you need to "trigger" your trigger and
provide some context data:

[source,typescript jsx]
----
plugins.uiActions.getTrigger('MY_APP_PIE_CHART_CLICK').exec({
  /* Custom context data. */
});
----

Finally, your code or developers from other plugins can register UI actions that
listen for the above trigger and execute some code when the trigger is triggered.

[source,typescript jsx]
----
plugins.uiActions.registerAction({
  id: 'DO_SOMETHING',
  isCompatible: async (context) => true,
  execute: async (context) => {
    // Do something.
  },
});
plugins.uiActions.attachAction('MY_APP_PIE_CHART_CLICK', 'DO_SOMETHING');
----

Now your `DO_SOMETHING` action will automatically execute when `MY_APP_PIE_CHART_CLICK`
trigger is triggered; or, if more than one compatible action is attached to
that trigger, user will be presented with a context menu popup to select one
action to execute.
