# @kbn/ambient-ui-types

This is a package of Typescript types for files that might get imported by Webpack and therefore need definitions.

These types will automatically be included for plugins.

## Packages

To include these types in a package:

- add `"//packages/kbn-ambient-ui-types"` to the `RUNTIME_DEPS` portion of the `BUILD.bazel` file.
- add `"@kbn/ambient-ui-types"` to the `types` portion of the `tsconfig.json` file.
