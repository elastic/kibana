  // > The Object.seal() static method seals an object.
  // > Sealing an object prevents extensions and makes existing properties non-configurable.
  // > A sealed object has a fixed set of properties: new properties cannot be added, existing properties cannot be removed,
  // > their enumerability and configurability cannot be changed, and its prototype cannot be re-assigned.
  // > Values of existing properties can still be changed as long as they are writable.
  // Object.freeze would take this one step further, and prevent the values of the properties from being changed as well.
  // This is not currently feasible for Kibana, as this functionality is required for some of the libraries that we use, such as react-dom/server.
  // While Object.seal() is not a silver bullet, it does provide a good balance between security and compatibility.
  // The goal is to prevent a majority of prototype pollution vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker.
