## Kibana Testbed

Sometimes when developing for Kibana, it is useful to have an isolated routable space to demonstrate new functionality. This Testbed provides such a space.

To make use of the testbed, edit the testbed.js, testbed.html, and testbed.less files as necessary. When you are done demonstrating
your new functionality, remember to cleanup your changes and restore the testbed to its pristine state for the next person.

To access the testbed, visit `http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/testbed`
