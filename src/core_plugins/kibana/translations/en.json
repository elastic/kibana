  "KIBANA-MUST_CONFIGURE_INDEX_PATTERN": "In order to use Kibana you must configure at least one index pattern. Index patterns are used to identify the Elasticsearch index to run search and analytics against. They are also used to configure fields.",

  "KIBANA-RECOMMEND_WILD_CARD_PATTERN_DETAILS": "Kibana is now smart enough to automatically determine which indices to search against within the current time range for wildcard index patterns. This means that wildcard index patterns now get the same performance optimizations when searching within a time range as time-interval patterns.",
