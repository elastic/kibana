      <p>
        Source filters can be used to exclude one or more fields when fetching the document source.
        This happens when viewing a document in the Discover app, or with a table displaying results
        from a saved search in the Dashboard app. Each row is built using the source of a single
        document, and if you have documents with large or unimportant fields you may benefit from
        filtering those out at this lower level.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that multi-fields will incorrectly appear as matches in the table below.
        These filters only actually apply to fields in the original source document,
        so matching multi-fields are not actually being filtered.
      </p>

    <EuiSpacer size="s" />
