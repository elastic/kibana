      We've detected that the following deprecated languages are in use:

      . Support for these languages will be removed in the next major version of Kibana and Elasticsearch. We recommend converting your scripted fields to 
      <EuiLink
        color="primary"
        href="http://www.elastic.co/painlessDocs"
        type="button"
