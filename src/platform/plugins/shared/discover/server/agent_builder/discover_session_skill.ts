    'Shows Elasticsearch documents and events as a live Discover table in chat. Use when the user wants to see rows, hits, or logs — not charts or aggregations.',
  content: `## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to **see documents, events, search hits, or logs** as a table in chat (for example "show me nginx 5xx events", "list the matching documents", "open these rows in a table").

Do **not** use this skill when the user wants a chart, metric, trend, breakdown, or any \`STATS\` aggregation. Use the visualization-creation skill and \`${platformCoreTools.createVisualization}\` instead.

## Routing

- Documents / rows / events / "show me the logs" → \`${platformCoreTools.createDiscoverSession}\` then \`<render_attachment>\`
- Aggregations / charts / \`STATS\` → \`${platformCoreTools.createVisualization}\` (never a Discover session)

Lens \`data_table\` is only for aggregated tabular summaries. It is not a substitute for a Discover document table.

## Workflow

1. Ground the index and field names if they are not already in context. Do not invent index or field names.
2. If creating a new table, call \`${platformCoreTools.generateEsql}\` once to produce a **document** query (\`FROM\` or \`TS\` with \`WHERE\` / \`LIMIT\` as needed). Do not invent ES|QL. Do not use \`STATS\`.
3. Call \`${platformCoreTools.createDiscoverSession}\` **exactly once**:
   - **Always omit \`attachment_id\`** unless a previous result of this tool in this conversation returned that exact id. Never invent an id. The skill name (\`discover-session\`) and attachment type (\`discover.session\`) are not ids. Never pass \`screen-context\`, \`.\`, or \`{attachment_id}\`.
   - To **create** when the conversation has no Discover session: omit \`attachment_id\`. Pass \`esql\` as the **string** from generateEsql (the \`esql\` field, not the whole tool result). \`title\` is optional. Optional \`time_range\` and \`columns\`.
   - If a Discover session already exists, omit \`attachment_id\` to **update** that table. Do **not** create a second session unless the user asked for another table.
   - Call \`${platformCoreTools.generateEsql}\` on update **only** when the user wants a different query. For title, columns, or time-range-only changes, omit \`esql\` so the stored query is kept.
4. After a successful tool result, **stop calling tools**. Paste the returned \`render\` string into your reply verbatim. Do not construct a \`<render_attachment>\` tag yourself. Do not call \`${platformCoreTools.createDiscoverSession}\` again for the same request.

Do not paste rows, tab JSON, or vis_context into the conversation. This skill does not execute ES|QL; the Discover table in chat runs the query.
