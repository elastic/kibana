 * Sequential (single-worker) Discover UI suite.

 * Tests that mutate server-wide state — e.g. toggling the `discover.isEsqlDefault`
 * feature flag — must live here rather than in `parallel.playwright.config.ts`.
 * The parallel config runs multiple spec files concurrently against one shared
 * Kibana server, so a server-wide change in one spec would leak into the others.
 * This config defaults to a single worker, so only one spec runs at a time and
 * such mutations stay isolated.
