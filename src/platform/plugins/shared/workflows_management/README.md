## Requirements

To use workflows, you need an **active Enterprise license**. Workflows are not available on Basic or Standard licenses.

---

## The Feature Flag

The workflows feature UI setting is enabled by default, it can be disabled via Kibana config with:

```yml
uiSettings.overrides:
  workflows:ui:enabled: false
```

If running in Serverless or Cloud dev environments, you can disable it via API:

```bash
POST kbn://internal/kibana/settings
{
   "changes": {
      "workflows:ui:enabled": false
   }
}
```

---

│  (React components, forms, visualizer)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Server API Layer                │
│      (REST endpoints, validation)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Service Layer                     │
│  (Business logic, workflow management)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Storage & Execution Layer            │
│ (Saved Objects, Task Manager, Engine)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## API versioning, compatibility, and stability

This section summarizes how public Workflows HTTP APIs are versioned and how that appears in documentation. For authoritative paths, parameters, and examples, use the generated OpenAPI surface.

### Version compatibility

| Topic | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **API date version** | Public routes use version `2023-10-31` (see `API_VERSION` in [`server/api/routes/utils/route_constants.ts`](./server/api/routes/utils/route_constants.ts)). |
| **Version header** | Send `elastic-api-version: 2023-10-31` on requests to public endpoints, consistent with [Kibana HTTP API versioning](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/dev_docs/contributing/kibana_http_api_design_guidelines.mdx#versioning). |
| **Stack introduction** | Public Workflows REST APIs are annotated with `since: 9.4.0` for stack deployments. |
| **License** | An **Enterprise** license is required (see [Requirements](#requirements)). |
| **Privileges** | Access is enforced via `workflowsManagement` feature privileges (see route `security` blocks under [`server/api/routes/`](./server/api/routes/)). |
| **UI setting `workflows:ui:enabled`** | Controls whether the **Workflows management application and related UI** are registered in the browser. It does **not** remove public REST routes under `/api/workflows`; those routes remain subject to license and authorization checks. |
| **Spaces** | Public URLs are space-aware (for example `/s/{space_id}/api/workflows` in documentation); see [Spaces](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/manage-spaces). |

---

## API Endpoints

Public HTTP APIs live under `/api/workflows` (space-aware in docs as `/s/{space_id}/api/workflows/...`). Send `elastic-api-version: 2023-10-31` on requests.

**OpenAPI (OAS) documentation for these endpoints:** use the generated bundles—[`kibana.yaml`](../../../../../oas_docs/output/kibana.yaml) (stateful) and [`kibana.serverless.yaml`](../../../../../oas_docs/output/kibana.serverless.yaml) (serverless)—or the published [Workflows API group (stateful)](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/group/endpoint-workflows) and [Workflows API group (serverless)](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/serverless/group/endpoint-workflows). Each public operation lists parameters, request bodies, responses, and examples.

### Public routes

| Method | Path | Summary |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/workflows` | List workflows (pagination and filters via query string). |
| POST | `/api/workflows` | Bulk create workflows. |

| GET | `/api/workflows/executions/{executionId}/trigger_event_trace` | Trigger event trace for an execution. |

### Internal routes

These routes use `access: internal` and are **not** included in the public OpenAPI bundles above. They use a numeric `elastic-api-version` (see `INTERNAL_API_VERSION` in [`server/api/routes/utils/route_constants.ts`](./server/api/routes/utils/route_constants.ts)). For validate, example payloads live in [`validate_workflow.yaml`](./server/api/routes/examples/validate_workflow.yaml).

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/internal/workflows/config` | Execution engine feature flags for the plugin. |
| POST | `/internal/workflows/disable` | Disable all workflows (administrative). |
| POST | `/api/workflows/validate` | Validate a workflow YAML definition without saving. |

---

## UI Application

The workflows management UI is available at `/app/workflows` when the feature flag is enabled.

### Features

- **Workflow Designer**: Visual workflow builder with drag-and-drop interface
- **Workflow Library**: Browse, search, and filter workflows
- **Execution Dashboard**: Monitor workflow executions in real-time
- **Execution History**: View past executions with filtering and sorting
- **Step-by-step Debugging**: Detailed step execution information
- **Connector Management**: View and configure available connectors

### Routes

- `/app/workflows` - Workflow library (home page)
- `/app/workflows/new` - Create new workflow
- `/app/workflows/edit/{id}` - Edit existing workflow
- `/app/workflows/{id}` - View workflow details
- `/app/workflows/{id}/executions` - View workflow execution history
- `/app/workflows/executions/{executionId}` - View execution details

### Pagination (HTTP APIs)

Many list endpoints accept `page` and `size` (or route-specific defaults) as **query parameters** on `GET` requests. Exact fields and response envelopes differ by route—use the OpenAPI entries for each operation.

**Examples** (add `elastic-api-version: 2023-10-31` and auth headers as for any public Kibana API):

List workflows (free-text `query` plus pagination):

```http
GET /api/workflows?page=1&size=20&query=sales
```

List executions for a workflow:

```http
GET /api/workflows/workflow/{workflowId}/executions?page=1&size=20
```

Execution logs (see the **workflows** OpenAPI operation for required vs optional query fields such as `size`, `page`, and `stepExecutionId`):

```http
GET /api/workflows/executions/{executionId}/logs
```

```

### Local Development

1. Enable the feature flag in `kibana.dev.yml`
2. Start Elasticsearch: `yarn es snapshot`
3. Start Kibana: `yarn start`
4. Navigate to `/app/workflows`

### Event-driven custom trigger `on` options

Registered (non-built-in) triggers may set optional flags under `triggers[].on` in YAML:

- **`workflowEvents`**: One of **`ignore`**, **`avoid-loop`**, or **`allow-all`** (string). Controls how the workflow is scheduled when the trigger event was emitted from a workflow-attributed chain:
  - **`ignore`**: Do not schedule when the emit is workflow-attributed; user or domain-originated emits (no chain context) still run the workflow.
  - **`avoid-loop`**: Schedule on workflow-attributed emits, but skip if this workflow id is already on the event chain (cycle guard). **Omitted defaults to `avoid-loop`** at runtime.
  - **`allow-all`**: Schedule without the cycle guard; **`maxEventChainDepth`** from the execution engine config still applies.

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
yarn test:jest src/platform/plugins/shared/workflows_management
# Running a specific test
yarn test:jest -- $path # (e.g. src/platform/plugins/shared/workflows_management/public/widgets/workflow_yaml_editor/lib/snippets/insert_trigger_snippet.test.ts)

# Run integration tests
yarn test:jest_integration src/platform/plugins/shared/workflows_management

# Run FTR tests (if available)
yarn test:ftr --config x-pack/test/workflows_management_api_integration/config.ts
```

### Authentication & Authorization

All API endpoints require authentication. The plugin integrates with Kibana's security framework:

- **Read operations**: Require `read` privilege on workflows
- **Write operations**: Require `write` privilege on workflows
- **Execute operations**: Require `execute` privilege on workflows
- **Delete operations**: Require `delete` privilege on workflows

Workflows are space-aware and respect Kibana Spaces boundaries.
