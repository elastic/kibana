Kibana Saved Objects have traditionally been considered content,
but the content management project aims to provide a single abstraction for Kibana and solution content.
This includes the registration and collection of content metadata as well as the rendering capabilities, caching layer, backward compatible CRUD & Search APIs,
and eventually a collection of new features that enhance content items by adding additional capabilities for personalization, private objects and content folders.
