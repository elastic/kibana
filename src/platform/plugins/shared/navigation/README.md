# Kibana Navigation Plugin

The Navigation plugin provides essential navigation components and services for Kibana. It serves as a central hub for navigation-related functionality across the application.

## Architecture

The Navigation plugin follows Kibana's client-server architecture:

- **[Client-side (public)](/public/README.md)**: React components and services for rendering navigation UI
- **[Server-side (server)](/server/README.md)**: Registration of UI settings and server endpoints
- **[Common](/common/README.md)**: Shared types, constants, and interfaces used by both sides

Please refer to the individual README files in each directory for detailed documentation on specific aspects of the plugin.
