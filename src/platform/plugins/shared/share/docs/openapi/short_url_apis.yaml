      summary: Create a short URL
      description: >
        Kibana URLs may be long and cumbersome, short URLs are much easier to remember and share.
        
        Short URLs are created by specifying the locator ID and locator parameters.
        When a short URL is resolved, the locator ID and locator parameters are used to redirect user to the right Kibana page.

                    When the `slug` parameter is omitted, the API will generate a random human-readable slug if `humanReadableSlug` is set to true.

                    > warn
                    > When you create a short URL, locator params are not validated, which allows you to pass arbitrary and ill-formed data into the API that can break Kibana. Make sure any data that you send to the API is properly formed.

                    A custom short URL slug.
                    The slug is the part of the short URL that identifies it.
                    You can provide a custom slug which consists of latin alphabet letters, numbers, and `-._` characters.
                    The slug must be at least 3 characters long, but no longer than 255 characters.
