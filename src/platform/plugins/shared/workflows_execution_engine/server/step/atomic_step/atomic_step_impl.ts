/**
 * Implements the execution logic for an atomic workflow step.
 *
 * `AtomicStepImpl` is responsible for running a single atomic step within a workflow.
 * It delegates the execution to a `ConnectorStepImpl`, passing the necessary configuration,
 * context manager, connector executor, and workflow state.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This class is typically used internally by the workflow execution engine to process
 * atomic nodes in the workflow graph.
 *
 * @param node - The atomic graph node containing step configuration.
 * @param contextManager - Manages workflow context and state.
 * @param connectorExecutor - Executes connector operations for the step.
 * @param workflowState - Manages the runtime state of workflow execution.
