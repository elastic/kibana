# Fallback-Step Implementation

## Overview

The fallback-step mechanism provides robust error handling in workflow execution by implementing a try-catch pattern that allows alternative execution paths when the primary path fails. This implementation creates a structured approach to execute fallback logic while preserving original error information for proper error handling.

## Algorithm and Logic

### Graph Construction

The fallback-step transforms a single step with `on-failure.fallback-step` configuration into a complex graph structure consisting of six interconnected nodes:

1. **EnterTryBlockNode** - Entry point that sets up the try-catch scope
2. **EnterNormalPathNode** - Initiates primary execution path with error monitoring
3. **ExitNormalPathNode** - Successful completion of primary path
4. **EnterFallbackPathNode** - Initiates alternative execution when primary path fails
5. **ExitFallbackPathNode** - Completion of fallback execution
6. **ExitTryBlockNode** - Final exit point that consolidates results

### Execution Flow

The execution follows a branching pattern:

**Normal Path (Success):**
EnterTryBlockNode → EnterNormalPathNode → [Original Steps] → ExitNormalPathNode → ExitTryBlockNode

**Fallback Path (Error):**
EnterTryBlockNode → EnterNormalPathNode → [Error Occurs] → EnterFallbackPathNode → [Fallback Steps] → ExitFallbackPathNode → ExitTryBlockNode

### Error Handling Logic

The EnterNormalPathNode implements sophisticated error catching:

- **First Error**: Captures the error, stores it in step state, clears workflow error, and redirects to fallback path
- **Subsequent Errors**: If error already exists in state, assumes fallback path has executed and allows continuation
- **Error Preservation**: Original error is preserved in step state even after fallback execution

## Node Implementation Breakdown

### EnterTryBlockNode
- **Role**: Initializes the try-catch scope and directs execution to the normal path
- **Behavior**: Enters new execution scope and navigates to the normal path entry point
- **Scope Management**: Creates isolated execution context for error handling

### EnterNormalPathNode  
- **Role**: Primary execution path entry with error monitoring capabilities
- **Behavior**: Enters execution scope and proceeds to next step
- **Error Catching**: Implements `StepErrorCatcher` interface to intercept failures
- **State Management**: Stores error information and manages redirection to fallback path

### ExitNormalPathNode
- **Role**: Successful completion of primary execution path
- **Behavior**: Exits current scope and navigates to try-block exit
- **Success Indication**: Signals successful primary path completion

### EnterFallbackPathNode
- **Role**: Alternative execution path entry point
- **Behavior**: Enters new execution scope for fallback operations
- **Recovery Logic**: Provides clean slate for alternative execution

### ExitFallbackPathNode
- **Role**: Completion of fallback execution path
- **Behavior**: Exits fallback scope and navigates to try-block exit
- **Error Preservation**: Maintains original error state for proper workflow error handling

### ExitTryBlockNode
- **Role**: Final consolidation point for both execution paths
- **Behavior**: Exits the overall try-catch scope
- **State Resolution**: Manages final workflow state regardless of path taken

## Interaction with Other On-Failure Mechanisms

### Priority Order
The handleStepLevelOperations function processes on-failure options in specific order:
1. **continue** (highest priority)
2. **fallback-step** (medium priority)  
3. **retry** (lowest priority)

### With Continue
When both `continue` and `fallback-step` are specified:
- Continue wrapper becomes outermost layer
- Fallback logic executes within continue scope
- Even if fallback succeeds, original error is preserved
- Continue suppresses the preserved error to allow workflow continuation

### With Retry
When both `retry` and `fallback-step` are specified:
- Fallback wrapper becomes outermost layer
- Retry logic executes within the normal path of fallback
- Fallback steps execute only when all retry attempts are exhausted

### Nested Combinations
Complex combinations create nested execution structures:
- `continue + fallback-step + retry`: Continue(Fallback(Retry(OriginalStep)))
- Each layer handles its specific failure recovery mechanism
- Inner layers execute before outer layers process remaining errors

#### Execution Flow for `continue + fallback-step + retry`:
1. **Continue wrapper** (outermost) - Suppresses all errors after inner mechanisms complete
2. **Fallback wrapper** (middle) - Provides alternative execution path if normal path fails
3. **Retry wrapper** (innermost) - Attempts multiple executions of original step
4. **Original step** - The actual step being executed

**Scenario execution:**
- Original step executes within retry mechanism (up to configured retry attempts)
- If all retry attempts fail, fallback steps execute (also with their own retry if configured)
- **Important**: Even if fallback steps succeed, the original error from normal path is preserved
- Continue mechanism suppresses the preserved error and allows workflow to proceed
- **Without continue**: Workflow fails even if fallback path succeeds, due to preserved original error

## Key Design Principles

### Scope Isolation
Each execution path maintains isolated scope to prevent state interference between normal and fallback operations.

### Error State Preservation
Original error information is preserved throughout fallback execution to maintain debugging capabilities and proper error reporting.

### Non-Destructive Recovery
Fallback execution provides alternative results without losing information about the original failure, enabling comprehensive error analysis. The original error is always preserved and will cause workflow failure unless explicitly suppressed by the continue mechanism.

### Composability
The fallback mechanism integrates seamlessly with other on-failure options (retry, continue) through ordered wrapper composition.
