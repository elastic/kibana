/**
 * Executes a workflow by continuously processing its steps until completion.
 *
 * This function implements a sequential workflow execution algorithm that:
 * 1. Iterates through workflow steps while the workflow status is RUNNING
 * 2. For each step:
 *    a. Retrieves the current step from the runtime
 *    b. Creates the step instance using the provided factory
 *    c. Executes the step
 *    d. Handles any errors that occur during execution
 *    e. Saves the workflow state after each step
 *    f. Flushes all logs collected during the step execution
 * 3. Ensures workflow state persistence after each step
 *
 * @param workflowRuntime - The runtime manager that tracks workflow execution state
 * @param workflowLogger - Logger responsible for capturing workflow execution events
 * @param nodesFactory - Factory for creating executable step instances
 *
 * @remarks
 * The execution loop handles errors at the step level, allowing the workflow to
 * continue or terminate based on the error handling logic in the catchError function.
 * State is saved after each step to ensure workflow can be resumed if interrupted.

 * Handles errors in workflow execution by iterating through the execution stack and attempting to catch errors at each step.

 *    a. Get the top nodeId from the stack
 *    b. Retrieve the node corresponding to this nodeId
 *    c. Create a step implementation for this node
 *    d. If the step implementation has a catchError method, invoke it to handle the error
 *    e. If the workflow execution still has an error after catchError is called, mark the step as failed
 *    f. Exit the current scope (pop from the stack)
 * 2. If an error occurs during this process, set it as the workflow error and log it
