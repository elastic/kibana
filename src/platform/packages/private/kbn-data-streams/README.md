# @kbn/data-streams

A set of (generally) stateless tools and utilities to ease working with Elasticsearch Data streams in TypeScript.

Inspired by `@kbn/storage-adapter` and other data stream adapter-like implementations in alerting and security solution.

## Core themes

* Safe defaults: e.g. when specifying mappings our utilities default to settings that avoid accidental mappings explosions. This is similar to the "principle of least surprise".
* Keep the easy stuff easy, make hard stuff easier by creating shared utilities
* TS type-safety: we use TypeScript, we like TypeScript, so yeah let's do more of that
* Convention > configuration: this package will expose test utilities that check backwards-compatible data evolution, but it won't enforce backwards compatible data evolution
* Use ES features to their fullest extent: in some cases all that is needed is runtime mapping to update a field value or an incorrectly mapped field

## Features

* Automatically detecting and applying mapping updates
* BYO serialization & deserialization (incoming)
* TypeScript utilities. Was type-safety already mentioned?
* Helpers for creating (search) runtime fields (incoming)
* Test utilities (incoming)


## Mapping updates

Mapping updates will apply to the current write-index and your index template. This means new mappings will only be applied to docs that arrive after your mappings update land.

### A note on backwards compatibility

These tools assume that you will be introducing backwards compatible changes to your mappings. If you do not apply bwc mappings you will hit a runtime error when running the `DataStreamClient.setup` method as it will try to update the current write index with your new mappings.

### Search-time runtime mappings (incoming)

Elasticsearch supports specifying runtime mappings at search time ([docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/data-store/mapping/define-runtime-fields-in-search-request)). This is a powerful tool that enables certain schema-on-read-like patterns, massive data migrations or backfills CAN be avoided!

Let's say I have written the following document:

```
POST my-data-stream/_doc
{
  "@timestamp": "2099-05-06T16:21:15.000Z",
  "message": """192.0.2.42 - - [06/May/2099:16:21:15 +0000] "GET /images/bg.jpg HTTP/1.0" 200 24736""",
}
```

But actually, I mapped `message` as a `keyword` field. With runtime mappings you can remap the field on the fly:

```
GET my-data-stream/_search
{
  "runtime_mappings": {
    "messageV2": {
      "type": "text",
      "script": {
        "source": """
          emit(doc['message'].value);
        """
      }
    }
  },
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  },
  "fields": ["messageV2"]
}
```

...but what if you want to move and transform the value of a field in the database, almost like a migration. To a limited degree this is possible to do at read time too!

```
GET my-data-stream/_search
{
  "runtime_mappings": {
    "messageV2": {
      "type": "text",
      "script": {
        "source": """
          if (params._source["messageV2"] != null) {
            // return what we have in source if there is something
            emit(params._source["messageV2"]);
          } else  {
            // return the original processed in some way
            emit(doc['message'].value + " the original, but processed");
          }
        """
      }
    }
  },
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  },
  "fields": ["messageV2"]
}
```

Using painless in this way is powerful, but we should be careful to ship performant and well tested painless in our code. That's why we expose a set of parameterised scripts for the most common use cases.

## Test utilites

We can consider creating the following test utilities:

```ts
test('myDataStream should be backwards compatible', async () => {
  await integrationTestHelpers.assertBackwardsCompatible([
    {
      sampleDocs: [
        {
          /* 1 */
        },
        // and so on...
      ],
      dataStream: v1,
    },
    {
      sampleDocs: [
        {
          /* 1 */
        },
        // and so on...
      ],
      dataStream: current,
    },
  ]);
});

test('snapshot', async () => {
  expect(integrationTestHelpers.toSnapshot(myDataStream)).toMatchSnapshot();
});

test('mappings hash v1', async () => {
  expect(integrationTestHelpers.mappingsHash(myDataStream)).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`hash-1`);
});
```

## Additional notes

1. How should we handle updating mappings? Do we just apply to the index template or go and update the existing write index as well? Yes.
2. Lazy creation possible... but eager update of mappings to existing data streams
   2.1. With option to eagerly create for when we know the data stream will be used, failing Kibana startup if data stream cannot be created.
   2.2. Data stream deletion a future possibility
3. Data streams for CRUD-like use cases: specifically updates
   3.1. Likely a future phase (requires updating underlying index)
   3.2. Consider removing possibility to control IDs at doc creation
4. We need guidance for teams to mostly be able to self-service their management/creation of data streams.
   4.1. We can largely rely on convention to start with: write a Jest integration test and take a snapshot of the serialized data stream declaration that you want to ship. Note: once merged these test snapshots should never change in a breaking way...
