When working on Serverless instances of Kibana, developers likely want to switch between different project types to test changes. This Project Switcher is intended to be placed into the header bar by the Serverless plugin when the server is in development mode to allow "quick switching" between configurations.

The connected component uses `http` to post a selection to a given API endpoint, intended to alter the YML configuration and trigger Watcher to restart the server.  To that end, it will post its message to a given API endpoint and replace the content of `document.body`.  The remainder of the process is left to the Serverless plugin.
