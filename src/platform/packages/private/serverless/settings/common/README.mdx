This package contains a list of UI settings that are available in all Serverless projects in the Advanced settings app.
This list is consumed by the `serverless` plugin, which merges it with any serverless project-specific settings that 
have been set up, and sends it to the uiSettings service to set an allowlist for the settings.

If you need to register a setting that should be available in all serverless projects, make sure to add its Id to this list.
