Many plugins display a "no data" page, either when there is no data in Elasticsearch, or there haven't been any data views created yet.  This component is meant
to be used in those scenarios.  It displays an appropriate message to the user and facilitate addition of integrations and creation of data views. 

The `KibanaNoDataPage` connected component uses:

- `hasUserDataView` and `hasData` API from the `HasData` service in the `data_views` plugin to check for existence of data an data views.
- `onDataViewCreated` callback once a data view has been created.
- (noDataConfig)[https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/src/platform/packages/shared/shared-ux/page/no_data/types/index.d.ts] as configuration for the page in case of no data.
