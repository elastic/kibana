# @kbn/scout-upgrade-testing

Release upgrade testing package for Kibana stateful deployments.

## Overview

This package contains end-to-end tests that verify Kibana functionality across version upgrades in stateful Elastic Cloud deployments. Tests are executed through the [AppEx QA Stateful Cloud Upgrade Tests pipeline](https://buildkite.com/elastic/appex-qa-stateful-cloud-upgrade-tests) and are built using the [@kbn/scout](../kbn-scout) testing framework.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this package is to ensure:

- ✅ Core Kibana features work correctly after version upgrades
- ✅ Data and saved objects persist through upgrade cycles
- ✅ User workflows remain functional across versions

## Testing Framework

Tests are written using **Scout**, Kibana's Playwright-based testing framework, which provides:

- Page object abstractions for Kibana applications
- Elastic Cloud deployment management
- Authentication helpers
- Advanced debugging capabilities
