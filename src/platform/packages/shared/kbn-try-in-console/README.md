# @kbn/try-in-console

This package contains the TryInConsoleButton which can be used to open the console with a provided console code snippet. This button will check if the Persistent Dev Console is currently on the page and open it with the code snippet if it's available. Otherwise it will open the Console in Dev Tools in a new browser tab.
