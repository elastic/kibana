/**
 * INTERIM intrinsic layout primitives. Everything here is `unstable*` on purpose.
 *
 * Why these exist
 * ---------------
 * Current EUI layout component depend on the *viewport*: `EuiFlexGroup`'s `responsive`
 * prop and `EuiFlexGrid`'s column collapse use `@media (max-width: …)` queries,
 * and `EuiShowFor` / `useCurrentEuiBreakpoint` read `window.innerWidth`.
 *
 * Kibana's new chrome is a CSS grid whose columns are `navigation | application |
 * sidebar`. Depending on whether the `navigation` and `sidebar` tracks are open,
 * available space will change independently from the viewport. The combination of
 * these results in layout bugs. See https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/257075.
 *
 * These helpers are a PoC for a proposal of a new set of layout primitives.
 * They are deliberately CSS-only. There is no state or DOM measurement
 * to justify components, and a style function is trivial to delete.
 *
 * When to delete
 * --------------
 * Once new primitives land in `@elastic/eui`. Delete each one as its EUI counterpart ships.
 *
 * Tracking issue: https://github.com/elastic/eui/issues/9867
