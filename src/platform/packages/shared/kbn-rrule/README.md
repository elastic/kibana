# @kbn/rrule

This package is deprecated in favor of [`rrule-es`](https://github.com/elastic/rrule-es)

It currently includes utility functions to help migrate code using the old schema (all lowercase params, non-iCal compliant) to the new schema. Delete this package once migration has been completed across the whole codebase.
