This package holds ambient typescript definitions for files with extensions like `.html, .png, .svg, .mdx` that might get imported by Webpack and therefore needed.

## Plugins
These types will automatically be included for plugins.

## Packages

To include these types in a package add `"@kbn/ambient-ui-types"` to the `types` portion of the `tsconfig.json` file.
