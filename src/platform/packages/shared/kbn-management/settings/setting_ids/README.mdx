This package contains the id's of all advanced settings.

When registering an advanced setting, add its id to this package and import it for use in the setting definition:

**packages/kbn-management/settings/setting_ids/index.ts**

```ts
export const MY_SETTING_ID = 'mySetting';
```

**src/plugins/my_plugin/server/plugin.ts**

```ts
import { MY_SETTING_ID } from '@kbn/management-settings-ids';

export class MyPlugin implements Plugin<object, object> {
  public setup(core: CoreSetup, dependencies: SetupDependencies) {
    core.uiSettings.register({
      [MY_SETTING_ID]: {
        name: 'My setting',
        value: 10,
        schema: schema.number(),
      },
    ...
    });
    
    return {};
  }
}  
```
