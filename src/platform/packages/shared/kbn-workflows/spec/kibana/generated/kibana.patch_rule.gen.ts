  summary: `Patch a detection rule`,
  description: `**Spaces method and path for this operation:**

<div><span class="operation-verb patch">patch</span>&nbsp;<span class="operation-path">/s/{space_id}/api/detection_engine/rules</span></div>

Refer to [Spaces](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/manage-spaces) for more information.

Update specific fields of an existing detection rule using the \`rule_id\` or \`id\` field.

The difference between the \`id\` and \`rule_id\` is that the \`id\` is a unique rule identifier that is randomly generated when a rule is created and cannot be set, whereas \`rule_id\` is a stable rule identifier that can be assigned during rule creation.
> warn
> When used with [API key](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/api-keys) authentication, the user's key gets assigned to the affected rules. If the user's key gets deleted or the user becomes inactive, the rules will stop running.

> If the API key that is used for authorization has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated the rule, the rule behavior might change.
