# @kbn/axe-config

This is package shares [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) rule configuration and options between various axe tests and test runners (e.g., Kibana FTR, Cypress, jest). The API remains the same between each axe runner, and should ideally be shared between each to maintain consistency across Kibana.
