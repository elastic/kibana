        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following

            For some cloud providers, like AWS or GCP, the region in which a function is hosted is essential to uniquely identify the function and also part of its endpoint. Since it's part of the endpoint being called, the region is always known to clients. In these cases, `faas.invoked_region` MUST be set accordingly. If the region is unknown to the client or not required for identifying the invoked function, setting `faas.invoked_region` is optional.

          Instrumentations MUST follow [Output messages JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-output-messages.json)

          Each message represents a single output choice/candidate generated by
          the model. Each message corresponds to exactly one generation
          (choice/candidate) and vice versa - one choice cannot be split across
          multiple messages or one message cannot contain parts from multiple choices.

          When the attribute is recorded on events, it MUST be recorded in structured
          form. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured
          format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Instrumentations MAY provide a way for users to filter or truncate
          output messages.

        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
          the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

        note: |
          Instrumentations SHOULD populate conversation id when they have it readily available
          for a given operation, for example:

          - when client framework being instrumented manages conversation history
          (see [LlamaIndex chat store](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/chat_stores/))
          - when instrumenting GenAI client libraries that maintain conversation on the backend side
          (see [AWS Bedrock agent sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-session-state.html),
          [OpenAI Assistant threads](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads))

          Application developers that manage conversation history MAY add conversation id to GenAI and other
          spans or logs using custom span or log record processors or hooks provided by instrumentation
          libraries.

          The value of this attribute matches source system tool definition format.

          It's expected to be an array of objects where each object represents a tool definition. In case a serialized string is available
          to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
          deserialize it to an array. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Since this attribute could be large, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate
          it by default. Instrumentations MAY provide a way to enable
          populating this attribute.

          If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
          or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

          If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        note: |
          HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
          By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
          the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
          and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

          If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

          If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
          the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named

        brief: HTTP request method.
        examples:
          - GET

          - HEAD
        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
          By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
          the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
          and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

          If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

          If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
          the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
          OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          If this override is done via declarative configuration, then the list MUST be configurable via the `known_methods` property
          (an array of strings with minimum items 0) under `.instrumentation/development.general.http.client` and/or
          `.instrumentation/development.general.http.server`.

          In either case, this list MUST be a full override of the default known methods,
          it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults.

          HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
          Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
          Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

          - /users/:userID?
          - my-controller/my-action/{id?}
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if it's available
        note: |
          MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
          SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

          A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
          are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

          A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

          Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
          support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute

        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
          or a component-specific, low cardinality error identifier.

          If a response status code is returned and status indicates an error,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions
          for the details on which values of `rpc.response.status_code` are considered errors.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set
          `error.type`.

        type: string
        brief: The fully-qualified logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective.
        examples:
          - com.example.ExampleService/exampleMethod
          - EchoService/Echo
          - _OTHER
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: if available.
        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

          conditionally_required: If and only if the operation failed.
        note: |
          If the RPC fails with an error before status code is returned,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
          or a component-specific, low cardinality error identifier.

          If a response status code is returned and status indicates an error,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions
          for the details on which values of `rpc.response.status_code` are considered errors.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set
          `error.type`.

      - name: rpc.method
        type: string
        brief: The fully-qualified logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective.
        examples:
          - com.example.ExampleService/exampleMethod
          - EchoService/Echo
          - _OTHER
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

      - name: rpc.response.status_code

        note: |
          Usually it represents an error code, but may also represent partial success, warning, or differentiate between various types of successful outcomes.
          Semantic conventions for individual RPC frameworks SHOULD document what `rpc.response.status_code` means in the context of that system and which values are considered to represent errors.

          Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
          It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
          Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
          If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
          If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
          Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

          For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

          For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

          - [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
          - A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
          - [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
          - [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

    brief: |
      A CICD worker is a component of the CICD system that performs work (eg. running pipeline tasks or performing sync).
      A single pipeline run may be distributed across multiple workers. Any OpenTelemetry signal associated with a worker should be associated to the worker that performed the corresponding work.
      For example, when a pipeline run involves several workers, its task run spans may reference the different `cicd.worker` resources corresponding to the workers that executed each task run. The pipeline run's parent span may instead reference the CICD controller as the `cicd.worker` resource.

          Cloud provider-specific native identifier of the monitored cloud resource (e.g. an [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) on AWS, a [fully qualified resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) on Azure, a [full resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names) on GCP)
        examples:
          - arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function:my-function
          - //run.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/services/SERVICE_ID
          - /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          On some cloud providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
          so it may be necessary to set `cloud.resource_id` as a span attribute instead.

          The exact value to use for `cloud.resource_id` depends on the cloud provider.
          The following well-known definitions MUST be used if you set this attribute and they apply:

          - **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
            Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
            [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
            with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invocable with
            multiple different aliases.
          - **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
          - **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) of the invoked function,
            *not* the function app, having the form
            `/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.
            This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function app can host multiple functions that would usually share
            a TracerProvider.

          Cloud provider-specific native identifier of the monitored cloud resource (e.g. an [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) on AWS, a [fully qualified resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) on Azure, a [full resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names) on GCP)
        examples:
          - arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function:my-function
          - //run.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/services/SERVICE_ID
          - /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          On some cloud providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
          so it may be necessary to set `cloud.resource_id` as a span attribute instead.

          The exact value to use for `cloud.resource_id` depends on the cloud provider.
          The following well-known definitions MUST be used if you set this attribute and they apply:

          - **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
            Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
            [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
            with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invocable with
            multiple different aliases.
          - **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
          - **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) of the invoked function,
            *not* the function app, having the form
            `/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.
            This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function app can host multiple functions that would usually share
            a TracerProvider.
        stability: development
      - name: faas.instance
        type: string
        brief: |
          The execution environment ID as a string, that will be potentially reused for other invocations to the same function/function version.
        examples:
          - 2021/06/28/[$LATEST]2f399eb14537447da05ab2a2e39309de
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          - **AWS Lambda:** Use the (full) log stream name.
        stability: development
      - name: faas.max_memory
        type: int
        brief: |
          The amount of memory available to the serverless function converted to Bytes.
        examples: 134217728
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          It's recommended to set this attribute since e.g. too little memory can easily stop a Java AWS Lambda function from working correctly. On AWS Lambda, the environment variable `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE` provides this information (which must be multiplied by 1,048,576).
        stability: development
      - name: faas.name
        type: string
        brief: |
          The name of the single function that this runtime instance executes.
        examples:
          - my-function
          - myazurefunctionapp/some-function-name
        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          This is the name of the function as configured/deployed on the FaaS
          platform and is usually different from the name of the callback
          function (which may be stored in the
          [`code.namespace`/`code.function.name`](/docs/general/attributes.md#source-code-attributes)
          span attributes).

          For some cloud providers, the above definition is ambiguous. The following
          definition of function name MUST be used for this attribute
          (and consequently the span name) for the listed cloud providers/products:

          - **Azure:**  The full name `<FUNCAPP>/<FUNC>`, i.e., function app name
            followed by a forward slash followed by the function name (this form
            can also be seen in the resource JSON for the function).
            This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function
            app can host multiple functions that would usually share
            a TracerProvider (see also the `cloud.resource_id` attribute).
        stability: development
      - name: faas.version
        type: string
        brief: The immutable version of the function being executed.
        examples:
          - '26'
          - pinkfroid-00002
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          Depending on the cloud provider and platform, use:

          - **AWS Lambda:** The [function version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-versions.html)
            (an integer represented as a decimal string).
          - **Google Cloud Run (Services):** The [revision](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/managing/revisions)
            (i.e., the function name plus the revision suffix).
          - **Google Cloud Functions:** The value of the
            [`K_REVISION` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/container-contract#services-env-vars).
          - **Azure Functions:** Not applicable. Do not set this attribute.

          Collecting `host.id` from non-containerized systems

          **Non-privileged Machine ID Lookup**

          When collecting `host.id` for non-containerized systems non-privileged lookups
          of the machine id are preferred. SDK detector implementations MUST use the
          sources listed below to obtain the machine id.

          | OS | Primary | Fallback |
          | --- | --- | --- |
          | Linux | contents of `/etc/machine-id` | contents of `/var/lib/dbus/machine-id` |
          | BSD | contents of `/etc/hostid` | output of `kenv -q smbios.system.uuid` |
          | MacOS | `IOPlatformUUID` line from the output of `ioreg -rd1 -c "IOPlatformExpertDevice"` | - |
          | Windows | `MachineGuid` from registry `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography` | - |

          **Privileged Machine ID Lookup**

          The `host.id` can be looked up using privileged sources. For example, Linux
          systems can use the output of `dmidecode -t system`, `dmidecode -t baseboard`,
          `dmidecode -t chassis`, or read the corresponding data from the filesystem
          (e.g. `cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_id`,
          `cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_uuid`, etc), however, SDK resource
          detector implementations MUST not collect `host.id` from privileged sources. If
          privileged lookup of `host.id` is required, the value should be injected via the
          `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable.

        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          K8s doesn't have support for obtaining a cluster ID. If this is ever
          added, we will recommend collecting the `k8s.cluster.uid` through the
          official APIs. In the meantime, we are able to use the `uid` of the
          `kube-system` namespace as a proxy for cluster ID. Read on for the
          rationale.

          Every object created in a K8s cluster is assigned a distinct UID. The
          `kube-system` namespace is used by Kubernetes itself and will exist
          for the lifetime of the cluster. Using the `uid` of the `kube-system`
          namespace is a reasonable proxy for the K8s ClusterID as it will only
          change if the cluster is rebuilt. Furthermore, Kubernetes UIDs are
          UUIDs as standardized by
          [ISO/IEC 9834-8 and ITU-T X.667](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/oid.html).
          Which states:

          > If generated according to one of the mechanisms defined in Rec.
          > ITU-T X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8, a UUID is either guaranteed to be
          > different from all other UUIDs generated before 3603 A.D., or is
          > extremely likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen).

          Therefore, UIDs between clusters should be extremely unlikely to
          conflict.

        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          MUST be unique for each instance of the same `service.namespace,service.name` pair (in other words
          `service.namespace,service.name,service.instance.id` triplet MUST be globally unique). The ID helps to
          distinguish instances of the same service that exist at the same time (e.g. instances of a horizontally scaled
          service).

          Implementations, such as SDKs, are recommended to generate a random Version 1 or Version 4 [RFC
          4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUID, but are free to use an inherent unique ID as the source of
          this value if stability is desirable. In that case, the ID SHOULD be used as source of a UUID Version 5 and
          SHOULD use the following UUID as the namespace: `4d63009a-8d0f-11ee-aad7-4c796ed8e320`.

          UUIDs are typically recommended, as only an opaque value for the purposes of identifying a service instance is
          needed. Similar to what can be seen in the man page for the
          [`/etc/machine-id`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/machine-id.html) file, the underlying
          data, such as pod name and namespace should be treated as confidential, being the user's choice to expose it
          or not via another resource attribute.

          For applications running behind an application server (like unicorn), we do not recommend using one identifier
          for all processes participating in the application. Instead, it's recommended each division (e.g. a worker
          thread in unicorn) to have its own instance.id.

          It's not recommended for a Collector to set `service.instance.id` if it can't unambiguously determine the
          service instance that is generating that telemetry. For instance, creating an UUID based on `pod.name` will
          likely be wrong, as the Collector might not know from which container within that pod the telemetry originated.
          However, Collectors can set the `service.instance.id` if they can unambiguously determine the service instance
          for that telemetry. This is typically the case for scraping receivers, as they know the target address and
          port.

        examples:
          - 9d59409acf479dfa0df1aa568182e43e43df8bbe28d60fcf2bc52e30068802cc
          - main
          - '123'
          - HEAD
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
          given time.The revision can be a full [hash value (see
          glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),
          of the recorded change to a ref within a repository pointing to a
          commit [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) object. It does
          not necessarily have to be a hash; it can simply define a [revision
          number](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html)
          which is an integer that is monotonically increasing. In cases where
          it is identical to the `ref.head.name`, it SHOULD still be included.
          It is up to the implementer to decide which value to set as the
          revision based on the VCS system and situational context.

      The `app.screen.click` event can be used to indicate that a user has clicked or tapped on the screen portion of an application. Clicks outside of an application's active area SHOULD NOT generate this event. This event does not differentiate between touch/mouse down and touch/mouse up. Implementations SHOULD give preference to generating this event at the time the click is complete, typically on touch release or mouse up. The location of the click event MUST be provided in absolute screen pixels.

    brief: |
      Defines feature flag evaluation as an event.
    note: |
      A `feature_flag.evaluation` event SHOULD be emitted whenever a feature flag value is evaluated, which may happen many times over the course of an application lifecycle. For example, a website A/B testing different animations may evaluate a flag each time a button is clicked. A `feature_flag.evaluation` event is emitted on each evaluation even if the result is the same.

            If and only if feature flag provider does not supply variant or equivalent concept. Otherwise, `feature_flag.result.value` should be treated as opt-in.
        note: |
          With some feature flag providers, feature flag results can be quite large or contain private or sensitive details.
          Because of this, `feature_flag.result.variant` is often the preferred attribute if it is available.

          It may be desirable to redact or otherwise limit the size and scope of `feature_flag.result.value` if possible.
          Because the evaluated flag value is unstructured and may be any type, it is left to the instrumentation author to determine how best to achieve this.

        note: |-
          A semantic identifier, commonly referred to as a variant, provides a means
          for referring to a value without including the value itself. This can
          provide additional context for understanding the meaning behind a value.
          For example, the variant `red` maybe be used for the value `#c05543`.

          Instrumentations MUST follow [Output messages JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-output-messages.json)

          Each message represents a single output choice/candidate generated by
          the model. Each message corresponds to exactly one generation
          (choice/candidate) and vice versa - one choice cannot be split across
          multiple messages or one message cannot contain parts from multiple choices.

          When the attribute is recorded on events, it MUST be recorded in structured
          form. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured
          format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Instrumentations MAY provide a way for users to filter or truncate
          output messages.

For example, a score value of 1 could mean "relevant" in one evaluation system and "not relevant" in another, depending on the scoring range and evaluator. The label SHOULD have low cardinality. Possible values depend on the evaluation metric and evaluator used; implementations SHOULD document the possible values.

      Depending on the value of the `faas.trigger` attribute, additional attributes MUST be set.

      For example, an `http` trigger SHOULD follow the [HTTP Server semantic conventions](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-span).
      For more information, refer to the [Function Trigger Type](#function-trigger-type) section.

      If Spans following this convention are produced, a Resource of type `faas` MUST exist following the [Resource semantic convention](/docs/resource/faas.md).

          Cloud provider-specific native identifier of the monitored cloud resource (e.g. an [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) on AWS, a [fully qualified resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) on Azure, a [full resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names) on GCP)

          - /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          On some cloud providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
          so it may be necessary to set `cloud.resource_id` as a span attribute instead.

          The exact value to use for `cloud.resource_id` depends on the cloud provider.
          The following well-known definitions MUST be used if you set this attribute and they apply:

          - **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
            Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
            [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
            with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invocable with
            multiple different aliases.
          - **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
          - **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) of the invoked function,
            *not* the function app, having the form
            `/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.
            This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function app can host multiple functions that would usually share
            a TracerProvider.

          Type of the trigger which caused this function invocation.

        note: |
          For the server/consumer span on the incoming side,
          `faas.trigger` MUST be set.

          Clients invoking FaaS instances usually cannot set `faas.trigger`,
          since they would typically need to look in the payload to determine
          the event type. If clients set it, it should be the same as the
          trigger that corresponding incoming would have (i.e., this has
          nothing to do with the underlying transport used to make the API
          call to invoke the lambda, which is often HTTP).

        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute

          conditionally_required: If and only if the messaging operation has failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute

          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          conditionally_required: If and only if the messaging operation has failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute

              brief: |
                A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.
              stability: stable
        brief: |
          Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
        examples:
          - amqp:decode-error
          - KAFKA_STORAGE_ERROR
          - channel-error
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if the messaging operation has failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

      - name: messaging.batch.message_count
        type: int
        brief: The number of messages sent, received, or processed in the scope of the batching operation.
        examples:
          - 0
          - 1
          - 2
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If the span describes an operation on a batch of messages.
        note: |
          Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message. When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.

          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute

          members:

              value: _OTHER
              brief: |
                A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.
              stability: stable
        brief: |
          Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
        examples:
          - amqp:decode-error
          - KAFKA_STORAGE_ERROR
          - channel-error
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if the messaging operation has failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

      - name: messaging.batch.message_count
        type: int
        brief: The number of messages sent, received, or processed in the scope of the batching operation.
        examples:
          - 0
          - 1
          - 2
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If the span describes an operation on a batch of messages.
        note: |
          Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message. When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.

          - MyTopic
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If span describes operation on a single message or if the value applies to all messages in the batch.
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
          the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.

              brief: |
                A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.
              stability: stable
        brief: |
          Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
        examples:
          - amqp:decode-error
          - KAFKA_STORAGE_ERROR
          - channel-error
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if the messaging operation has failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If the span describes an operation on a batch of messages.
        note: |
          Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message. When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.

        brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
          By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
          the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
          and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

          If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

          If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
          the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
          OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          If this override is done via declarative configuration, then the list MUST be configurable via the `known_methods` property
          (an array of strings with minimum items 0) under `.instrumentation/development.general.http.client` and/or
          `.instrumentation/development.general.http.server`.

          In either case, this list MUST be a full override of the default known methods,
          it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults.

          HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
          Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
          Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no

          conditionally_required: if and only if a route was successfully matched.
        note: |
          MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
          SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

          A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
          are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

          A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

          Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
          support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute

        brief: |
          The name of the connection pool; unique within the instrumented application. In case the connection pool implementation doesn't provide a name, instrumentation SHOULD use a combination of parameters that would make the name unique, for example, combining attributes `server.address`, `server.port`, and `db.namespace`, formatted as `server.address:server.port/db.namespace`. Instrumentations that generate connection pool name following different patterns SHOULD document it.

          The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
          as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
          calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)

          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          The actual DBMS may differ from the one identified by the client. For example, when using PostgreSQL client libraries to connect to a CockroachDB, the `db.system.name` is set to `postgresql` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

              brief: |
                A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.
              stability: stable
        brief: |
          Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
        examples:
          - timeout
          - java.net.UnknownHostException
          - server_certificate_invalid
          - '500'
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if the operation failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
          When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

          The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful

          calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
          section.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query summary
          then that query summary SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,

          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).

          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          The actual DBMS may differ from the one identified by the client. For example, when using PostgreSQL client libraries to connect to a CockroachDB, the `db.system.name` is set to `postgresql` based on the instrumentation's best knowledge.

              brief: |
                A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.
              stability: stable
        brief: |
          Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
        examples:
          - timeout
          - java.net.UnknownHostException
          - server_certificate_invalid
          - '500'
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if the operation failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
          When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

        requirement_level:

        note: |
          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document whether `network.peer.*` attributes are applicable. Network peer address and port are useful when the application interacts with individual database nodes directly.

        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

        brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include

        brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

        brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

          HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
          By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
          the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
          and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

          If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

          If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
          the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
          OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          If this override is done via declarative configuration, then the list MUST be configurable via the `known_methods` property
          (an array of strings with minimum items 0) under `.instrumentation/development.general.http.client` and/or
          `.instrumentation/development.general.http.server`.

          In either case, this list MUST be a full override of the default known methods,
          it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults.

          HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
          Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
          Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

          HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
          By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
          the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
          and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

          If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

          If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
          the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
          OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          If this override is done via declarative configuration, then the list MUST be configurable via the `known_methods` property
          (an array of strings with minimum items 0) under `.instrumentation/development.general.http.client` and/or
          `.instrumentation/development.general.http.server`.

          In either case, this list MUST be a full override of the default known methods,
          it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults.

          HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
          Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
          Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

          or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

          If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
          or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

          If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

        requirement_level: required
        note: |
          HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
          By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
          the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
          and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

          If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

          If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
          the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
          OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          If this override is done via declarative configuration, then the list MUST be configurable via the `known_methods` property
          (an array of strings with minimum items 0) under `.instrumentation/development.general.http.client` and/or
          `.instrumentation/development.general.http.server`.

          In either case, this list MUST be a full override of the default known methods,
          it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults.

          HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
          Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
          Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

          conditionally_required: If and only if it's available
        note: |
          MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
          SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

          A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
          are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

          A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

          Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
          support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

          If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

          If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications

          support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

    note: |
      `hw.status` is currently specified as an *UpDownCounter* but would ideally be represented using a [*StateSet* as defined in OpenMetrics](https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/blob/v1.0.0/specification/OpenMetrics.md#stateset). This semantic convention will be updated once *StateSet* is specified in OpenTelemetry. This planned change is not expected to have any consequence on the way users query their timeseries backend to retrieve the values of `hw.status` over time.

    note: |
      This value is pulled directly from the K8s API and the value can go indefinitely high and be reset to 0
      at any time depending on how your kubelet is configured to prune dead containers.
      It is best to not depend too much on the exact value but rather look at it as
      either == 0, in which case you can conclude there were no restarts in the recent past, or > 0, in which case
      you can conclude there were restarts in the recent past, and not try and analyze the value beyond that.

        note: |
          Starting from .NET 9, Kestrel `kestrel.connection.duration` metric reports
          the following errors types when a corresponding error occurs:

          | Value | Description |
          | --- | --- |
          | `aborted_by_app` | The HTTP/1.1 connection was aborted when app code aborted an HTTP request with `HttpContext.Abort()`. |
          | `app_shutdown_timeout` | The connection was aborted during app shutdown. During shutdown, the server stops accepting new connections and HTTP requests, and it is given time for active requests to complete. If the app shutdown timeout is exceeded, all remaining connections are aborted. |
          | `closed_critical_stream` | A critical control stream for an HTTP/3 connection was closed. |
          | `connection_reset` | The connection was reset while there were active HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 streams on the connection. |
          | `error_after_starting_response` | An error such as an unhandled application exception or invalid request body occurred after the response was started, causing an abort of the HTTP/1.1 connection. |
          | `error_reading_headers` | An error occurred when decoding HPACK headers in an HTTP/2 `HEADERS` frame. |
          | `error_writing_headers` | An error occurred when encoding HPACK headers in an HTTP/2 `HEADERS` frame. |
          | `flow_control_queue_size_exceeded` | The connection exceeded the outgoing flow control maximum queue size and was closed with `INTERNAL_ERROR`. This can be caused by an excessive number of HTTP/2 stream resets. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93303). |
          | `flow_control_window_exceeded` | The client sent more data than allowed by the current flow-control window. |
          | `frame_after_stream_close` | An HTTP/2 frame was received on a closed stream. |
          | `insufficient_tls_version` | The connection doesn't have TLS 1.2 or greater, as required by HTTP/2. |
          | `invalid_body_reader_state` | An error occurred when draining the request body, aborting the HTTP/1.1 connection. This could be caused by app code reading the request body and missing a call to `PipeReader.AdvanceTo` in a finally block. |
          | `invalid_data_padding` | An HTTP/2 `HEADER` or `DATA` frame has an invalid amount of padding. |
          | `invalid_frame_length` | An HTTP/2 frame was received with an invalid frame payload length. The frame could contain a payload that is not valid for the type, or a `DATA` frame payload does not match the length specified in the frame header. |
          | `invalid_handshake` | An invalid HTTP/2 handshake was received. |
          | `invalid_http_version` | The connection received an HTTP request with the wrong version. For example, a browser sends an HTTP/1.1 request to a plain-text HTTP/2 connection. |
          | `invalid_request_headers` | The HTTP request contains invalid headers. This error can occur in a number of scenarios: a header might not be allowed by the HTTP protocol, such as a pseudo-header in the `HEADERS` frame of an HTTP/2 request. A header could also have an invalid value, such as a non-integer `content-length`, or a header name or value might contain invalid characters. |
          | `invalid_request_line` | The first line of an HTTP/1.1 request was invalid, potentially due to invalid content or exceeding the allowed limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestLineSize`. |
          | `invalid_settings` | The connection received an HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 `SETTINGS` frame with invalid settings. |
          | `invalid_stream_id` | An HTTP/2 stream with an invalid stream ID was received. |
          | `invalid_window_update_size` | The server received an HTTP/2 `WINDOW_UPDATE` frame with a zero increment, or an increment that caused a flow-control window to exceed the maximum size. |
          | `io_error` | An `IOException` occurred while reading or writing HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 connection data. |
          | `keep_alive_timeout` | There was no activity on the connection, and the keep-alive timeout configured by `KestrelServerLimits.KeepAliveTimeout` was exceeded. |
          | `max_concurrent_connections_exceeded` | The connection exceeded the maximum concurrent connection limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxConcurrentConnections`. |
          | `max_frame_length_exceeded` | The connection received an HTTP/2 frame that exceeded the size limit specified by `Http2Limits.MaxFrameSize`. |
          | `max_request_body_size_exceeded` | The HTTP request body exceeded the maximum request body size limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestBodySize`. |
          | `max_request_header_count_exceeded` | The HTTP request headers exceeded the maximum count limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestHeaderCount`. |
          | `max_request_headers_total_size_exceeded` | The HTTP request headers exceeded the maximum total size limit. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MaxRequestHeadersTotalSize`. |
          | `min_request_body_data_rate` | Reading the request body timed out due to data arriving too slowly. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MinRequestBodyDataRate`. |
          | `min_response_data_rate` | Writing the response timed out because the client did not read it at the specified minimum data rate. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.MinResponseDataRate`. |
          | `missing_stream_end` | The connection received an HTTP/2 `HEADERS` frame for trailers without a stream end flag. |
          | `output_queue_size_exceeded` | The connection exceeded the output queue size and was closed with `INTERNAL_ERROR`. This can be caused by an excessive number of HTTP/2 stream resets. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93303). |
          | `request_headers_timeout` | Request headers timed out while waiting for headers to be received after the request started. Configured by `KestrelServerLimits.RequestHeadersTimeout`. |
          | `response_content_length_mismatch` | The HTTP response body sent data that didn't match the response's `content-length` header. |
          | `server_timeout` | The connection timed out with the `IConnectionTimeoutFeature`. |
          | `stream_creation_error` | The HTTP/3 connection received a stream that it wouldn't accept. For example, the client created duplicate control streams. |
          | `stream_reset_limit_exceeded` | The connection received an excessive number of HTTP/2 stream resets and was closed with `ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM`. For more information, see [Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-44487](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93303). |
          | `stream_self_dependency` | The connection received an HTTP/2 frame that caused a frame to depend on itself. |
          | `tls_handshake_failed` | An error occurred during the TLS handshake for a connection. Only reported for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connections. The TLS handshake for HTTP/3 is internal to QUIC transport. ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
          | `tls_not_supported` | A TLS handshake was received by an endpoint that isn't configured to support TLS. |
          | `unexpected_end_of_request_content` | The HTTP/1.1 request body ended before the data specified by the `content-length` header or chunked transfer encoding mechanism was received. |
          | `unexpected_frame` | An unexpected HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 frame type was received. The frame type is either unknown, unsupported, or invalid for the current stream state. |
          | `unknown_stream` | An HTTP/2 frame was received on an unknown stream. |
          | `write_canceled` | The cancellation of a response body write aborted the HTTP/1.1 connection. |

          In other cases, `error.type` contains the fully qualified type name of the exception.

        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if session ends with an error.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute

          conditionally_required: If and only if the messaging operation has failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          conditionally_required: If and only if the messaging operation has failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          conditionally_required: If and only if the messaging operation has failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute

                A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.
              stability: stable
        brief: |
          Describes a class of error the operation ended with.

          conditionally_required: If and only if the messaging operation has failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute

          - '500'
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

                A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.

          Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
        examples:

          - '500'
          - java.net.UnknownHostException
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

        brief: |
          A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.

          - otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0
          - custom-name
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
          E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

          Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
          Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

          The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
          For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
          instance of the given component type is started.

          With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
          as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
          These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

                A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.

        examples:

          - timeout
          - '500'
          - java.net.UnknownHostException
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          - otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0
          - custom-name
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
          E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

          Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
          Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

          The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
          For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
          instance of the given component type is started.

          With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
          as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
          These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If operation has ended with an error
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.
        examples:
          - otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0
          - custom-name
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
          E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

          Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
          Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

          The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
          For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
          instance of the given component type is started.

          With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
          as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
          These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

                A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.
              stability: stable
        brief: |
          Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
        examples:
          - rejected
          - timeout
          - '500'
          - java.net.UnknownHostException
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

        brief: |
          A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.
        examples:
          - otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0
          - custom-name
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
          E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

          Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
          Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

          The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
          For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
          instance of the given component type is started.

          With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
          as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
          These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.

        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
          E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

          Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
          Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

          The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
          For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
          instance of the given component type is started.

          With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
          as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
          These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
          E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

          Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
          Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

          The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
          For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
          instance of the given component type is started.

          With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
          as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
          These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

          or a component-specific, low cardinality error identifier.

          If a response status code is returned and status indicates an error,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions

          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods

          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified

        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

          `error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions

        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

    note: |
      This is an alternative to `system.memory.usage` metric with `state=free`.
      Linux starting from 3.14 exports "available" memory. It takes "free" memory as a baseline, and then factors in kernel-specific values.
      This is supposed to be more accurate than just "free" memory.
      For reference, see the calculations [here](https://superuser.com/a/980821).
      See also `MemAvailable` in [/proc/meminfo](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html).

      The sum over the `reclaimable` and `unreclaimable` state values in `memory.linux.slab.usage` SHOULD be equal to the total slab memory available on the system.
      Note that the total slab memory is not constant and may vary over time.

          Its value SHOULD persist across launches of the same application installation, including through application upgrades.
          It SHOULD change if the application is uninstalled or if all applications of the vendor are uninstalled.
          Additionally, users might be able to reset this value (e.g. by clearing application data).
          If an app is installed multiple times on the same device (e.g. in different accounts on Android), each `app.installation.id` SHOULD have a different value.
          If multiple OpenTelemetry SDKs are used within the same application, they SHOULD use the same value for `app.installation.id`.
          Hardware IDs (e.g. serial number, IMEI, MAC address) MUST NOT be used as the `app.installation.id`.

          For iOS, this value SHOULD be equal to the [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor).

          For Android, examples of `app.installation.id` implementations include:

          - [Firebase Installation ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/manage-installations).
          - A globally unique UUID which is persisted across sessions in your application.
          - [App set ID](https://developer.android.com/identity/app-set-id).
          - [`Settings.getString(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID).

    brief: |
      This group describes attributes specific to artifacts. Artifacts are files or other immutable objects that are intended for distribution. This definition aligns directly with the [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/terminology#package-model) package model.
    attributes:
      - name: artifact.attestation.filename
        type: string
        brief: |
          The provenance filename of the built attestation which directly relates to the build artifact filename. This filename SHOULD accompany the artifact at publish time. See the [SLSA Relationship](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/distributing-provenance#relationship-between-artifacts-and-attestations) specification for more information.
        examples:
          - golang-binary-amd64-v0.1.0.attestation

      - name: artifact.filename
        type: string
        brief: |
          The human readable file name of the artifact, typically generated during build and release processes. Often includes the package name and version in the file name.
        examples:
          - golang-binary-amd64-v0.1.0
          - docker-image-amd64-v0.1.0

        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          This file name can also act as the [Package Name](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/terminology#package-model)
          in cases where the package ecosystem maps accordingly.
          Additionally, the artifact [can be published](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/terminology#software-supply-chain)
          for others, but that is not a guarantee.
        stability: development
      - name: artifact.hash

        brief: |
          The full [hash value (see glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf), often found in checksum.txt on a release of the artifact and used to verify package integrity.
        examples:
          - 9ff4c52759e2c4ac70b7d517bc7fcdc1cda631ca0045271ddd1b192544f8a3e9
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The specific algorithm used to create the cryptographic hash value is
          not defined. In situations where an artifact has multiple
          cryptographic hashes, it is up to the implementer to choose which
          hash value to set here; this should be the most secure hash algorithm
          that is suitable for the situation and consistent with the
          corresponding attestation. The implementer can then provide the other
          hash values through an additional set of attribute extensions as they
          deem necessary.

Note that some (but not all) of these values can overlap with values in the [`os.type` and `os.name` attributes](./os.md). However, for consistency, the values in the `browser.platform` attribute should capture the exact value that the user agent provides.

    brief: |
      This group describes attributes specific to pipelines within a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system. A [pipeline](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)) in this case is a series of steps that are performed in order to deliver a new version of software. This aligns with the [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/pipeline) definition of a pipeline where a **pipeline** is the system for developing and producing something. In the context of CI/CD, a pipeline produces or delivers software.

  - id: registry.client
    type: attribute_group
    brief: |
      These attributes may be used to describe the client in a connection-based network interaction where there is one side that initiates the connection (the client is the side that initiates the connection). This covers all TCP network interactions since TCP is connection-based and one side initiates the connection (an exception is made for peer-to-peer communication over TCP where the "user-facing" surface of the protocol / API doesn't expose a clear notion of client and server). This also covers UDP network interactions where one side initiates the interaction, e.g. QUIC (HTTP/3) and DNS.
    attributes:
      - name: client.address
        type: string
        brief: Client address - domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.
        examples:
          - client.example.com
          - 10.1.2.80
          - /tmp/my.sock
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          When observed from the server side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `client.address` SHOULD represent the client address behind any intermediaries,  for example proxies, if it's available.

          The geographical region within a cloud provider. When associated with a resource, this attribute specifies the region where the resource operates. When calling services or APIs deployed on a cloud, this attribute identifies the region where the called destination is deployed.

        type: string
        brief: |
          Cloud provider-specific native identifier of the monitored cloud resource (e.g. an [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) on AWS, a [fully qualified resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) on Azure, a [full resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names) on GCP)
        examples:
          - arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function:my-function
          - //run.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/services/SERVICE_ID
          - /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          On some cloud providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
          so it may be necessary to set `cloud.resource_id` as a span attribute instead.

          The exact value to use for `cloud.resource_id` depends on the cloud provider.
          The following well-known definitions MUST be used if you set this attribute and they apply:

          - **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
            Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
            [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
            with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invocable with
            multiple different aliases.
          - **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
          - **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) of the invoked function,
            *not* the function app, having the form
            `/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.
            This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function app can host multiple functions that would usually share
            a TracerProvider.

        note: |
          Docker defines a sha256 of the image id; `container.image.id` corresponds to the `Image` field from the Docker container inspect [API](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.52/#tag/Container/operation/ContainerInspect) endpoint.
          K8s defines a link to the container registry repository with digest `"imageID": "registry.azurecr.io /namespace/service/dockerfile@sha256:bdeabd40c3a8a492eaf9e8e44d0ebbb84bac7ee25ac0cf8a7159d25f62555625"`.
          The ID is assigned by the container runtime and can vary in different environments. Consider using `oci.manifest.digest` if it is important to identify the same image in different environments/runtimes.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
          up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)

          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).

          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

          This implies that resources carrying the following attribute combinations MUST be
          considered to be identifying the same service:

    type: attribute_group
    brief: |
      These attributes may be used to describe the receiver of a network exchange/packet. These should be used when there is no client/server relationship between the two sides, or when that relationship is unknown. This covers low-level network interactions (e.g. packet tracing) where you don't know if there was a connection or which side initiated it. This also covers unidirectional UDP flows and peer-to-peer communication where the "user-facing" surface of the protocol / API doesn't expose a clear notion of client and server.
    attributes:
      - name: destination.address
        type: string
        brief: Destination address - domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.
        examples:
          - destination.example.com
          - 10.1.2.80
          - /tmp/my.sock
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          When observed from the source side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `destination.address` SHOULD represent the destination address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

          Its value SHOULD be identical for all apps on a device and it SHOULD NOT change if an app is uninstalled and re-installed.
          However, it might be resettable by the user for all apps on a device.
          Hardware IDs (e.g. vendor-specific serial number, IMEI or MAC address) MAY be used as values.

          It is also NOT RECOMMENDED to duplicate the value of `exception.message` in `error.message`.

                A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value.
              stability: stable
        brief: |
          Describes a class of error the operation ended with.

          - server_certificate_invalid
          - '500'
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          It's recommended to set this attribute since e.g. too little memory can easily stop a Java AWS Lambda function from working correctly. On AWS Lambda, the environment variable `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE` provides this information (which must be multiplied by 1,048,576).

          - myazurefunctionapp/some-function-name
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          This is the name of the function as configured/deployed on the FaaS
          platform and is usually different from the name of the callback
          function (which may be stored in the
          [`code.namespace`/`code.function.name`](/docs/general/attributes.md#source-code-attributes)
          span attributes).

          For some cloud providers, the above definition is ambiguous. The following
          definition of function name MUST be used for this attribute
          (and consequently the span name) for the listed cloud providers/products:

          - **Azure:**  The full name `<FUNCAPP>/<FUNC>`, i.e., function app name
            followed by a forward slash followed by the function name (this form
            can also be seen in the resource JSON for the function).
            This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function
            app can host multiple functions that would usually share
            a TracerProvider (see also the `cloud.resource_id` attribute).

      - name: file.fork_name
        type: string
        brief: |
          Name of the fork. A fork is additional data associated with a filesystem object.
        examples:
          - Zone.Identifier
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          On Linux, a resource fork is used to store additional data with a filesystem object. A file always has at least one fork for the data portion, and additional forks may exist.
          On NTFS, this is analogous to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), and the default data stream for a file is just called $DATA. Zone.Identifier is commonly used by Windows to track contents downloaded from the Internet. An ADS is typically of the form: C:\path\to\filename.extension:some_fork_name, and some_fork_name is the value that should populate `fork_name`. `filename.extension` should populate `file.name`, and `extension` should populate `file.extension`. The full path, `file.path`, will include the fork name.

A data source may be an external database, object store, document collection, website, or any other storage system used by the GenAI agent or application. The `gen_ai.data_source.id` SHOULD match the identifier used by the GenAI system rather than a name specific to the external storage, such as a database or object store. Semantic conventions referencing `gen_ai.data_source.id` MAY also leverage additional attributes, such as `db.*`, to further identify and describe the data source.

        note: |
          This attribute provides a human-readable interpretation of the evaluation score produced by an evaluator. For example, a score value of 1 could mean "relevant" in one evaluation system and "not relevant" in another, depending on the scoring range and evaluator. The label SHOULD have low cardinality. Possible values depend on the evaluation metric and evaluator used; implementations SHOULD document the possible values.

        brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

    brief: |
      Geo fields can carry data about a specific location related to an event. This geolocation information can be derived from techniques such as Geo IP, or be user-supplied.
      Note: Geo attributes are typically used under another namespace, such as client.* and describe the location of the corresponding entity (device, end-user, etc). Semantic conventions that reference geo attributes (as a root namespace) or embed them (under their own namespace) SHOULD document what geo attributes describe in the scope of that convention.

        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which headers are to be captured.
          Including all request headers can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

          The `User-Agent` header is already captured in the `user_agent.original` attribute.
          Users MAY explicitly configure instrumentations to capture them even though it is not recommended.

          The attribute value MUST consist of either multiple header values as an array of strings
          or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
          the HTTP library provides access to headers.

          Examples:

          - A header `Content-Type: application/json` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.content-type`
            attribute with value `["application/json"]`.
          - A header `X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.x-forwarded-for`
            attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` or `["1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5"]` depending on the HTTP library.

        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
          By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
          the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
          and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

          If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

          If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
          the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
          OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          If this override is done via declarative configuration, then the list MUST be configurable via the `known_methods` property
          (an array of strings with minimum items 0) under `.instrumentation/development.general.http.client` and/or
          `.instrumentation/development.general.http.server`.

          In either case, this list MUST be a full override of the default known methods,
          it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults.

          HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
          Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
          Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
          SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

          A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
          are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

          A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

          Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
          support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          K8s doesn't have support for obtaining a cluster ID. If this is ever
          added, we will recommend collecting the `k8s.cluster.uid` through the
          official APIs. In the meantime, we are able to use the `uid` of the
          `kube-system` namespace as a proxy for cluster ID. Read on for the
          rationale.

          Every object created in a K8s cluster is assigned a distinct UID. The
          `kube-system` namespace is used by Kubernetes itself and will exist
          for the lifetime of the cluster. Using the `uid` of the `kube-system`
          namespace is a reasonable proxy for the K8s ClusterID as it will only
          change if the cluster is rebuilt. Furthermore, Kubernetes UIDs are
          UUIDs as standardized by
          [ISO/IEC 9834-8 and ITU-T X.667](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/oid.html).
          Which states:

          > If generated according to one of the mechanisms defined in Rec.
          > ITU-T X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8, a UUID is either guaranteed to be
          > different from all other UUIDs generated before 3603 A.D., or is
          > extremely likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen).

          Therefore, UIDs between clusters should be extremely unlikely to
          conflict.

    brief: |
      This section defines attributes for Oracle Database.
    attributes:
      - name: oracle.db.domain
        type: string
        brief: |
          The database domain associated with the connection.
        examples:
          - example.com
          - corp.internal
          - prod.db.local
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          This attribute SHOULD be set to the value of the `DB_DOMAIN` initialization parameter,
          as exposed in `v$parameter`. `DB_DOMAIN` defines the domain portion of the global
          database name and SHOULD be configured when a database is, or may become, part of a
          distributed environment. Its value consists of one or more valid identifiers
          (alphanumeric ASCII characters) separated by periods.

      - name: oracle.db.instance.name
        type: string
        brief: |
          The instance name associated with the connection in an Oracle Real Application Clusters environment.
        examples:
          - ORCL1
          - ORCL2
          - ORCL3
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          There can be multiple instances associated with a single database service. It indicates the
          unique instance name to which the connection is currently bound. For non-RAC databases, this value
          defaults to the `oracle.db.name`.
        stability: development
      - name: oracle.db.name
        type: string
        brief: |
          The database name associated with the connection.

          - ORCL1
          - FREE
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          This attribute SHOULD be set to the value of the parameter `DB_NAME` exposed in `v$parameter`.
        stability: development
      - name: oracle.db.pdb
        type: string
        brief: |
          The pluggable database (PDB) name associated with the connection.
        examples:
          - PDB1
          - FREEPDB
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          This attribute SHOULD reflect the PDB that the session is currently connected to.
          If instrumentation cannot reliably obtain the active PDB name for each operation
          without issuing an additional query (such as `SELECT SYS_CONTEXT`), it is
          RECOMMENDED to fall back to the PDB name specified at connection establishment.
        stability: development
      - name: oracle.db.service
        type: string
        brief: |
          The service name currently associated with the database connection.
        examples:
          - order-processing-service
          - db_low.adb.oraclecloud.com
          - db_high.adb.oraclecloud.com
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The effective service name for a connection can change during its lifetime,
          for example after executing sql, `ALTER SESSION`. If an instrumentation cannot reliably
          obtain the current service name for each operation without issuing an additional
          query (such as `SELECT SYS_CONTEXT`), it is RECOMMENDED to fall back to the
          service name originally provided at connection establishment.

          A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.

        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          Implementations SHOULD ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
          E.g. implementations MUST NOT use UUIDs as values for this attribute.

          Implementations MAY achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
          Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.

          The value of `instance-counter` MAY be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance MUST be guaranteed.
          For example, `<instance-counter>` MAY be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
          instance of the given component type is started.

          With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
          as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
          These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.

    type: attribute_group
    brief: This document defines attributes for remote procedure calls.
    attributes:
      - name: rpc.method
        type: string
        brief: The fully-qualified logical name of the method from the RPC interface perspective.
        examples:
          - com.example.ExampleService/exampleMethod
          - EchoService/Echo
          - _OTHER
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

      - name: rpc.method_original

        examples:

            - 1.2.3.5
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which metadata values are to be captured.
          Including all request metadata values can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

          For example, a property `my-custom-key` with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` SHOULD be recorded as
          `rpc.request.metadata.my-custom-key` attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]`

    brief: |
      These attributes may be used to describe the server in a connection-based network interaction where there is one side that initiates the connection (the client is the side that initiates the connection). This covers all TCP network interactions since TCP is connection-based and one side initiates the connection (an exception is made for peer-to-peer communication over TCP where the "user-facing" surface of the protocol / API doesn't expose a clear notion of client and server). This also covers UDP network interactions where one side initiates the interaction, e.g. QUIC (HTTP/3) and DNS.

      - name: service.instance.id
        type: string
        brief: |
          The string ID of the service instance.
        examples:
          - 627cc493-f310-47de-96bd-71410b7dec09
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          MUST be unique for each instance of the same `service.namespace,service.name` pair (in other words
          `service.namespace,service.name,service.instance.id` triplet MUST be globally unique). The ID helps to
          distinguish instances of the same service that exist at the same time (e.g. instances of a horizontally scaled
          service).

          Implementations, such as SDKs, are recommended to generate a random Version 1 or Version 4 [RFC
          4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUID, but are free to use an inherent unique ID as the source of
          this value if stability is desirable. In that case, the ID SHOULD be used as source of a UUID Version 5 and
          SHOULD use the following UUID as the namespace: `4d63009a-8d0f-11ee-aad7-4c796ed8e320`.

          UUIDs are typically recommended, as only an opaque value for the purposes of identifying a service instance is
          needed. Similar to what can be seen in the man page for the
          [`/etc/machine-id`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/machine-id.html) file, the underlying
          data, such as pod name and namespace should be treated as confidential, being the user's choice to expose it
          or not via another resource attribute.

          For applications running behind an application server (like unicorn), we do not recommend using one identifier
          for all processes participating in the application. Instead, it's recommended each division (e.g. a worker
          thread in unicorn) to have its own instance.id.

          It's not recommended for a Collector to set `service.instance.id` if it can't unambiguously determine the
          service instance that is generating that telemetry. For instance, creating an UUID based on `pod.name` will
          likely be wrong, as the Collector might not know from which container within that pod the telemetry originated.
          However, Collectors can set the `service.instance.id` if they can unambiguously determine the service instance
          for that telemetry. This is typically the case for scraping receivers, as they know the target address and
          port.

      Session is defined as the period of time encompassing all activities performed by the application and the actions executed by the end user.
      Consequently, a Session is represented as a collection of Logs, Events, and Spans emitted by the Client Application throughout the Session's duration. Each Session is assigned a unique identifier, which is included as an attribute in the Logs, Events, and Spans generated during the Session's lifecycle.
      When a session reaches end of life, typically due to user inactivity or session timeout, a new session identifier will be assigned. The previous session identifier may be provided by the instrumentation so that telemetry backends can link the two sessions.

  - id: registry.source
    type: attribute_group
    brief: |
      These attributes may be used to describe the sender of a network exchange/packet. These should be used when there is no client/server relationship between the two sides, or when that relationship is unknown. This covers low-level network interactions (e.g. packet tracing) where you don't know if there was a connection or which side initiated it. This also covers unidirectional UDP flows and peer-to-peer communication where the "user-facing" surface of the protocol / API doesn't expose a clear notion of client and server.
    attributes:
      - name: source.address
        type: string
        brief: Source address - domain name if available without reverse DNS lookup; otherwise, IP address or Unix domain socket name.
        examples:
          - source.example.com
          - 10.1.2.80
          - /tmp/my.sock
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          When observed from the destination side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `source.address` SHOULD represent the source address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

          `telemetry.sdk.name` attribute to the fully-qualified class or module name of this SDK's main entry point
          or another suitable identifier depending on the language.
          The identifier `opentelemetry` is reserved and MUST NOT be used in this case.
          All custom identifiers SHOULD be stable across different versions of an implementation.

          For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment
          is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.

          `url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`.
          In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.

          `url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed).

          Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the
          value `REDACTED`:

          * [`AWSAccessKeyId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
          * [`Signature`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)

          This list is subject to change over time.

          When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.

        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
          or a component-specific, low cardinality error identifier.

          If a response status code is returned and status indicates an error,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to that status code. Check system-specific conventions
          for the details on which values of `rpc.response.status_code` are considered errors.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set
          `error.type`.

        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

      Consequently, a Session is represented as a collection of Logs, Events, and Spans emitted by the Client Application throughout the Session's duration. Each Session is assigned a unique identifier, which is included as an attribute in the Logs, Events, and Spans generated during the Session's lifecycle.
      When a session reaches end of life, typically due to user inactivity or session timeout, a new session identifier will be assigned. The previous session identifier may be provided by the instrumentation so that telemetry backends can link the two sessions.

          The value of this attribute matches source system tool definition format.

          It's expected to be an array of objects where each object represents a tool definition. In case a serialized string is available
          to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
          deserialize it to an array. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Since this attribute could be large, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate
          it by default. Instrumentations MAY provide a way to enable
          populating this attribute.

        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

  - id: span.aws.client
    type: span
    brief: |
      This span describes an AWS SDK client call.
    note: |
      **Span name** MUST be of the format `Service.Operation` as per the
      AWS HTTP API, e.g., `DynamoDB.GetItem`, `S3.ListBuckets`. This is
      equivalent to concatenating `rpc.service` and `rpc.method` with `.` and
      consistent with the naming guidelines for RPC client spans.

      AWS SDK span attributes are based on the request or response parameters
      in AWS SDK API calls. The conventions have been collected over time based
      on feedback from AWS users of tracing and will continue to increase as new
      interesting conventions are found.

        brief: |
          The UUID of the [AWS Lambda EvenSource Mapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-eventsourcemapping.html). An event source is mapped to a lambda function. It's contents are read by Lambda and used to trigger a function. This isn't available in the lambda execution context or the lambda runtime environtment. This is going to be populated by the AWS SDK for each language when that UUID is present. Some of these operations are Create/Delete/Get/List/Update EventSourceMapping.

        note: |
          The `db.operation.name` has the following list of well-known values.
          If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used.

          Batch operations:

          - `execute_batch`

          Bulk operations:

          - `execute_bulk` SHOULD be used on spans reported for methods like
            [`executeBulkOperations`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.azure/azure-cosmos/latest/com/azure/cosmos/CosmosAsyncContainer.html#executeBulkOperations(reactor.core.publisher.Flux)),
            which represents a bulk execution of multiple operations.
          - `bulk_{operation name}` (`bulk_create_item`, `bulk_upsert_item`, etc) SHOULD be used on spans describing individual operations (when they are reported)
            within the bulk. This pattern SHOULD be used when instrumentation creates span per each operation, but operations are buffered and then performed in bulk.
            For example, this applies when [`AllowBulkExecution`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.allowbulkexecution)
            property is configured on the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` client.

          - `read_container_throughput`
          - `replace_container`

          If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
          then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
          up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

          Examples:

          - For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
            the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

          - For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(userName)s;` with parameter
            `userName = "jdoe"`, the attribute `db.query.parameter.userName` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          The human readable name of a task within a pipeline. Task here most closely aligns with a [computing process](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)) in a pipeline. Other terms for tasks include commands, steps, and procedures.
        examples:
          - Run GoLang Linter
          - Go Build
          - go-test

        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

          When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
          canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
          Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
          it's RECOMMENDED to:

          - Use a domain-specific attribute
          - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match

          calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)

            Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
            Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)).
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

  - id: span.db.client
    type: span
    brief: This span describes database client call.
    note: |
      Instrumentations SHOULD, when possible, record database spans that cover the duration of
      the corresponding API call as if it was observed by the caller (such as client application).
      For example, if a transient issue happened and was retried within this database call, the corresponding
      span should cover the duration of the logical operation with all retries.

      When a database client provides higher-level convenience APIs for specific operations
      (e.g., calling a stored procedure), which internally generate and execute a generic query,
      it is RECOMMENDED to instrument the higher-level convenience APIs.
      These often allow setting `db.operation.*` attributes, which usually are not
      readily available at the generic query level.

      **Span name** is covered in the [Name](/docs/db/database-spans.md#name) section.

      **Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`. It MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
      in-memory database calls.
      It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind when database system being instrumented usually
      runs in a different process than its client or when database calls happen over
      instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

      **Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.
      Semantic conventions for individual systems SHOULD specify which values of `db.response.status_code`
      classify as errors.

    attributes:
      - name: db.collection.name
        type: string
        brief: The name of a collection (table, container) within the database.
        examples:
          - public.users
          - customers
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: |
            If readily available and if a database call is performed on a single collection.
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          The collection name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
          when the database system supports query text with multiple collections
          in non-batch operations.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same
          collection name then that collection name SHOULD be used.

          conditionally_required: If available.
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          If a database system has multiple namespace components, they SHOULD be concatenated from the most general to the most specific namespace component, using `|` as a separator between the components. Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.
          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace` means in the context of that system.
          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

          - 4
        requirement_level: recommended

        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: |
            If readily available and if there is a single operation name that describes the database call.
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`,
          when the database system supports query text with multiple operations
          in non-batch operations.

          If spaces can occur in the operation name, multiple consecutive spaces
          SHOULD be normalized to a single space.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same operation name
          then that operation name SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
          otherwise `db.operation.name` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
          system specific term if more applicable.

      - name: db.query.parameter
        type: template[string]
        brief: |
          A database query parameter, with `<key>` being the parameter name, and the attribute value being a string representation of the parameter value.
        examples:
          - someval
          - '55'
        requirement_level: opt_in
        note: |
          If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
          then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
          up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

          Examples:

          - For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
            the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

          - For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(userName)s;` with parameter
            `userName = "jdoe"`, the attribute `db.query.parameter.userName` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

        requirement_level:
          recommended: if available through instrumentation hooks or if the instrumentation supports generating a query summary.
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
          as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
          calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
          section.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query summary
          then that query summary SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
          otherwise `db.query.summary` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
          system specific term if more applicable.
        stability: stable
      - name: db.query.text

          - SELECT * FROM wuser_table where username = ?
          - SET mykey ?
        requirement_level:
          recommended: |
            Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
            Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)).
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

          Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
        examples:

        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
          When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

        note: |
          HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
          By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
          the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
          and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

          If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

          If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
          the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
          OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          If this override is done via declarative configuration, then the list MUST be configurable via the `known_methods` property
          (an array of strings with minimum items 0) under `.instrumentation/development.general.http.client` and/or
          `.instrumentation/development.general.http.server`.

          In either case, this list MUST be a full override of the default known methods,
          it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults.

          HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
          Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
          Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

          For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment
          is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.

          `url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`.
          In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.

          `url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed).

          Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the
          value `REDACTED`:

          * [`AWSAccessKeyId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)

          * [`X-Goog-Signature`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)

          This list is subject to change over time.

          When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.
          `https://www.example.com/path?color=blue&sig=REDACTED`.

        note: |
          The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
          as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
          calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
          section.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query summary
          then that query summary SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
          otherwise `db.query.summary` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
          system specific term if more applicable.

        requirement_level:

            Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
            Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)).
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

          MariaDB uses vendor-specific error codes on all errors and reports [SQLSTATE](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/sqlstate/) in some cases.
          MariaDB error codes are more granular than SQLSTATE, so MariaDB instrumentations SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to this known error code.
          When SQLSTATE is available, SQLSTATE of "Class 02" or higher SHOULD be considered errors. When SQLSTATE is not available, all MariaDB error codes SHOULD be considered errors.

          The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
          When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.

          without triggering an additional query to be executed (e.g. `SELECT DATABASE()`),
          then it is RECOMMENDED to fallback and use the database provided when the connection was established.

          Instrumentation SHOULD document if `db.namespace` reflects the database provided when the connection was established.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

          A database query parameter, with `<key>` being the parameter name, and the attribute value being a string representation of the parameter value.
        examples:
          - someval
          - '55'
        requirement_level: opt_in
        note: |
          If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
          then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
          up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

          Examples:

          - For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
            the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

          - For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(userName)s;` with parameter
            `userName = "jdoe"`, the attribute `db.query.parameter.userName` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
          as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
          calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
          section.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query summary
          then that query summary SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
          otherwise `db.query.summary` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
          system specific term if more applicable.
        stability: stable

        requirement_level:
          recommended: |
            Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
            Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)).
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match

        note: |
          The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
          as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
          calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following

          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

          `db.namespace` SHOULD be set to the combination of instance and database name following the `{instance_name}|{database_name}` pattern.

          A connection's currently associated database may change during its lifetime, e.g. from executing `USE <database>`.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations

            Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
            Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)).

        note: |
          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

      The SQL databases Semantic Conventions describes how common [Database Semantic Conventions](/docs/db/database-spans.md) apply to SQL databases.
    note: |
      The following database systems (defined in the
      [`db.system.name`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#notes-and-well-known-identifiers-for-dbsystemname) set)
      are known to use SQL as their primary query language:

      - `actian.ingres`
      - `cockroachdb`
      - `derby`
      - `firebirdsql`
      - `h2database`
      - `hsqldb`
      - `ibm.db2`
      - `mariadb`
      - `microsoft.sql_server`
      - `mysql`
      - `oracle.db`
      - `other_sql`
      - `postgresql`
      - `sap.maxdb`
      - `sqlite`
      - `trino`

      Many other database systems support SQL and can be accessed via generic database driver such as JDBC or ODBC.
      Instrumentations applied to generic SQL drivers SHOULD adhere to SQL semantic conventions.

        brief: The name of a collection (table, container) within the database.
        examples:
          - public.users
          - customers
        requirement_level:
          recommended: If the operation is executed via a higher-level API that does not support multiple collection names.
        note: |
          The collection name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`.
        stability: stable
      - name: db.namespace
        type: string
        brief: |
          The database associated with the connection, fully qualified within the server address and port.
        examples:
          - customers
          - test.users
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If available without an additional network call.
        note: |
          If a database system has multiple namespace components (e.g. schema name and database name), they SHOULD be concatenated
          from the most general to the most specific namespace component,
          using `|` as a separator between the components.
          Any missing components (and their associated separators) SHOULD be omitted.

          Semantic conventions for individual database systems SHOULD document what `db.namespace`
          means in the context of that system.

          A connection's currently associated database may change during its lifetime, e.g. from executing `USE <database>`.

          If instrumentation is unable to capture the connection's currently associated database on each query
          without triggering an additional query to be executed (e.g. `SELECT DATABASE()`),
          then it is RECOMMENDED to fallback and use the database provided when the connection was established.

          Instrumentation SHOULD document if `db.namespace` reflects the database provided when the connection was established.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application without attempting to do any case normalization.

          - 4
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          Operations are only considered batches when they contain two or more operations, and so `db.operation.batch.size` SHOULD never be `1`.

          - EXECUTE
          - INSERT
        requirement_level:
          recommended: If the operation is executed via a higher-level API that does not support multiple operation names.
        note: |
          The operation name SHOULD NOT be extracted from `db.query.text`.

        brief: |
          A database query parameter, with `<key>` being the parameter name, and the attribute value being a string representation of the parameter value.
        examples:
          - someval
          - '55'
        requirement_level: opt_in
        note: |
          If a query parameter has no name and instead is referenced only by index,
          then `<key>` SHOULD be the 0-based index.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match
          up with the parameterized placeholders present in `db.query.text`.

          It is RECOMMENDED to capture the value as provided by the application
          without attempting to do any case normalization.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD NOT be captured on batch operations.

          Examples:

          - For a query `SELECT * FROM users where username =  %s` with the parameter `"jdoe"`,
            the attribute `db.query.parameter.0` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

          - For a query `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %(userName)s;` with parameter
            `userName = "jdoe"`, the attribute `db.query.parameter.userName` SHOULD be set to `"jdoe"`.

        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
          as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
          calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
          section.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query summary
          then that query summary SHOULD be used prepended by `BATCH `,
          otherwise `db.query.summary` SHOULD be `BATCH` or some other database
          system specific term if more applicable.
        stability: stable

          - SET mykey ?
        requirement_level:
          recommended: |
            Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
            Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)).
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

          - 2201B
        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If response has ended with warning or an error.
        note: |
          SQL defines [SQLSTATE](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLSTATE) as a database
          return code which is adopted by some database systems like PostgreSQL.
          See [PostgreSQL error codes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html)
          for the details.

          Other systems like MySQL, Oracle, or MS SQL Server define vendor-specific
          error codes. Database SQL drivers usually provide access to both properties.
          For example, in Java, the [`SQLException`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/SQLException.html)
          class reports them with `getSQLState()` and `getErrorCode()` methods.

          Instrumentations SHOULD populate the `db.response.status_code` with the
          the most specific code available to them.

          Here's a non-exhaustive list of databases that report vendor-specific
          codes with granularity higher than SQLSTATE (or don't report SQLSTATE
          at all):

          - [DB2 SQL codes](https://www.ibm.com/docs/db2-for-zos/12?topic=codes-sql).
          - [Maria DB error codes](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/reference/error-codes)
          - [Microsoft SQL Server errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors)
          - [MySQL error codes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/9.0/en/error-reference-introduction.html)
          - [Oracle error codes](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28278/toc.htm)
          - [SQLite result codes](https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html)

          These systems SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to a
          known vendor-specific error code. If only SQLSTATE is available,
          it SHOULD be used.

          When multiple error codes are available and specificity is unclear,
          instrumentation SHOULD set the `db.response.status_code` to the
          concatenated string of all codes with '/' used as a separator.

          For example, generic DB instrumentation that detected an error and has
          SQLSTATE `"42000"` and vendor-specific `1071` should set
          `db.response.status_code` to `"42000/1071"`."

        requirement_level:
          conditionally_required: If and only if the operation failed.
        note: |
          The `error.type` SHOULD match the `db.response.status_code` returned by the database or the client library, or the canonical name of exception that occurred.
          When using canonical exception type name, instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to report the most relevant type. For example, if the original exception is wrapped into a generic one, the original exception SHOULD be preferred.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document how `error.type` is populated.

    type: span
    brief: |
      The span describes DNS lookup or reverse lookup performed with one of the methods on [System.Net.Dns](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.dns) class.
    note: |
      DNS spans track logical operations rather than physical DNS calls and the actual behavior depends on the
      resolver implementation which could be changed in the future versions of .NET.
      .NET 9 uses OS DNS resolver which may do zero or more physical lookups for one API call.

      When the *DNS lookup* span is reported along with *HTTP connection setup* and *socket connect* span,
      the *DNS lookup* span span becomes a child of *HTTP connection setup* and a sibling of *socket connect*.

      DNS lookup duration is also reported by [`dns.lookup.duration` metric](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-dns-metrics.md#metric-dnslookupduration).

      Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `Experimental.System.Net.NameResolution.DnsLookup`, `ActivitySource` name - `Experimental.System.Net.NameResolution`.
      Added in .NET 9.

      **Span name** SHOULD be `DNS lookup {dns.question.name}` for DNS lookup (IP addresses from host name)
      and `DNS reverse lookup {dns.question.name}` for reverse lookup (host names from IP address).

    type: span
    brief: |
      The span describes the establishment of the HTTP connection. It includes the time it takes to resolve the DNS, establish the socket connection, and perform the TLS handshake.
    note: |
      There is no parent-child relationship between the [*HTTP client request*](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-client-request) and the
      [*HTTP connection setup*]/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md(/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-connection-setup) spans;
      the latter will always be a root span, defining a separate trace.

      However, if the connection attempt represented by the [*HTTP connection setup*](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-connection-setup) span results in a
      successful HTTP connection, and that connection is picked up by a request to serve it, the instrumentation adds a link
      to the [*HTTP client request*](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-client-request) span pointing to the *HTTP connection setup* span.
      I.e., each request is linked to the connection that served this request.

      Corresponding `Activity.OperationName` is `Experimental.System.Net.Http.Connections.ConnectionSetup`, `ActivitySource` name - `Experimental.System.Net.Http.Connections`.
      Added in .NET 9.

      **Span name** SHOULD be `HTTP connection_setup {server.address}:{server.port}`.

    note: |
      The span is reported only if there was no connection readily available when request has started.
      It's reported as a child of *HTTP client request* span.

      The span ends when the connection is obtained - it could happen when an existing connection becomes available or once
      a new connection is established, so the duration of *Wait For Connection* span is different from duration of the
      [*HTTP connection setup*](/docs/dotnet/dotnet-network-traces.md#http-connection-setup) span.

      The time it takes to get a connection from the pool is also reported by the

If the region is unknown to the client or not required for identifying the invoked function, setting `faas.invoked_region` is optional.

          Clients invoking FaaS instances usually cannot set `faas.trigger`,
          since they would typically need to look in the payload to determine
          the event type. If clients set it, it should be the same as the
          trigger that corresponding incoming would have (i.e., this has
          nothing to do with the underlying transport used to make the API
          call to invoke the lambda, which is often HTTP).

        brief: The Generative AI provider as identified by the client or server instrumentation.
        requirement_level: required
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

        requirement_level: required
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

      GenAI instrumentations that can instrument tool execution calls SHOULD do so,
      unless another instrumentation can reliably cover all supported tool types.
      MCP tool executions may also be traced by the
      [corresponding MCP instrumentation](/docs/gen-ai/mcp.md#client).

      Tools are often executed directly by application code. Application developers
      are encouraged to follow this semantic convention for tools invoked by their
      own code and to manually instrument any tool calls that automatic
      instrumentations do not cover.

    type: span
    brief: |
      This span represents a client call to Generative AI model or service that generates a response or requests a tool call based on the input prompt.
    note: |
      **Span name** SHOULD be `{gen_ai.operation.name} {gen_ai.request.model}`.
      Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format
      and MUST follow the overall [guidelines for span names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.37.0/specification/trace/api.md#span).

      **Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT` and MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
      call to models running in the same process. It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind
      when the GenAI system being instrumented usually runs in a different process than its
      client or when the GenAI call happens over instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

          The value of this attribute matches source system tool definition format.

          It's expected to be an array of objects where each object represents a tool definition. In case a serialized string is available
          to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
          deserialize it to an array. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Since this attribute could be large, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate
          it by default. Instrumentations MAY provide a way to enable
          populating this attribute.

    type: span
    brief: |
      Describes GenAI agent invocation.
    note: |
      The `gen_ai.operation.name` SHOULD be `invoke_agent`.

      **Span name** SHOULD be `invoke_agent {gen_ai.agent.name}` if `gen_ai.agent.name` is readily available.
      When `gen_ai.agent.name` is not available, it SHOULD be `invoke_agent`.
      Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format.

      **Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT` and MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
      invocation of agents running in the same process.
      It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind when the agent being instrumented usually runs
      in a different process than its caller or when the agent invocation happens over
      instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

      Examples of span kinds for different agent scenarios:

      - `CLIENT`: Remote agent services (e.g., OpenAI Assistants API, AWS Bedrock Agents)
      - `INTERNAL`: In-process agents (e.g., LangChain agents, CrewAI agents)

          Instrumentations SHOULD populate conversation id when they have it readily available
          for a given operation, for example:

          - when client framework being instrumented manages conversation history
          (see [LlamaIndex chat store](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/storing/chat_stores/))
          - when instrumenting GenAI client libraries that maintain conversation on the backend side

          [OpenAI Assistant threads](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/threads))

          Application developers that manage conversation history MAY add conversation id to GenAI and other
          spans or logs using custom span or log record processors or hooks provided by instrumentation
          libraries.

          Data sources are used by AI agents and RAG applications to store grounding data. A data source may be an external database, object store, document collection, website, or any other storage system used by the GenAI agent or application. The `gen_ai.data_source.id` SHOULD match the identifier used by the GenAI system rather than a name specific to the external storage, such as a database or object store. Semantic conventions referencing `gen_ai.data_source.id` MAY also leverage additional attributes, such as `db.*`, to further identify and describe the data source.

        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

          This attribute SHOULD be used when the corresponding provider or API
          allows to provide system instructions or messages separately from the
          chat history.

          Instructions that are part of the chat history SHOULD be recorded in
          `gen_ai.input.messages` attribute instead.

          Instrumentations MUST follow [System instructions JSON schema](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-system-instructions.json).

          When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured
          format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Instrumentations MAY provide a way for users to filter or truncate
          system instructions.

          The value of this attribute matches source system tool definition format.

          It's expected to be an array of objects where each object represents a tool definition. In case a serialized string is available
          to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
          deserialize it to an array. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Since this attribute could be large, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate
          it by default. Instrumentations MAY provide a way to enable
          populating this attribute.

          conditionally_required: when applicable
        note: |
          The attribute SHOULD be set based on the instrumentation's best
          knowledge and may differ from the actual model provider.

          Multiple providers, including Azure OpenAI, Gemini, and AI hosting platforms
          are accessible using the OpenAI REST API and corresponding client libraries,
          but may proxy or host models from different providers.

          The `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, and `server.address`
          attributes may help identify the actual system in use.

          The `gen_ai.provider.name` attribute acts as a discriminator that
          identifies the GenAI telemetry format flavor specific to that provider
          within GenAI semantic conventions.
          It SHOULD be set consistently with provider-specific attributes and signals.
          For example, GenAI spans, metrics, and events related to AWS Bedrock
          should have the `gen_ai.provider.name` set to `aws.bedrock` and include
          applicable `aws.bedrock.*` attributes and are not expected to include
          `openai.*` attributes.

    type: span
    brief: |
      This span represents an outbound HTTP request.
    note: |
      There are two ways HTTP client spans can be implemented in an instrumentation:

      1. Instrumentations SHOULD create an HTTP span for each attempt to send an HTTP request over the wire.
         In case the request is resent, the resend attempts MUST follow the [HTTP resend spec](#http-request-retries-and-redirects).
         In this case, instrumentations SHOULD NOT (also) emit a logical encompassing HTTP client span.

      2. If for some reason it is not possible to emit a span for each send attempt (because e.g. the instrumented library does not expose hooks that would allow this),
         instrumentations MAY create an HTTP span for the top-most operation of the HTTP client.
         In this case, the `url.full` MUST be the absolute URL that was originally requested, before any HTTP-redirects that may happen when executing the request.

      **Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/http/http-spans.md#name) section.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

      **Span status:** refer to the [Span Status](/docs/http/http-spans.md#status) section.

        note: |
          If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
          or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

          If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
          additional filters are applied.

          If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

          Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which headers are to be captured.
          Including all request headers can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

          The `User-Agent` header is already captured in the `user_agent.original` attribute.
          Users MAY explicitly configure instrumentations to capture them even though it is not recommended.

          The attribute value MUST consist of either multiple header values as an array of strings
          or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
          the HTTP library provides access to headers.

          Examples:

          - A header `Content-Type: application/json` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.content-type`
            attribute with value `["application/json"]`.

          HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
          By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
          the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
          and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

          If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

          If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
          the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
          OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          If this override is done via declarative configuration, then the list MUST be configurable via the `known_methods` property
          (an array of strings with minimum items 0) under `.instrumentation/development.general.http.client` and/or
          `.instrumentation/development.general.http.server`.

          In either case, this list MUST be a full override of the default known methods,
          it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults.

          HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
          Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
          Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        note: |
          If the request fails with an error before response status code was sent or received,
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to exception type (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable)
          or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

          If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an error according to [HTTP span status definition](/docs/http/http-spans.md),
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string), an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low, but
          telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
          should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time, when no
          additional filters are applied.

        note: |
          Instrumentations SHOULD require an explicit configuration of which headers are to be captured.
          Including all request headers can be a security risk - explicit configuration helps avoid leaking sensitive information.

          The `User-Agent` header is already captured in the `user_agent.original` attribute.
          Users MAY explicitly configure instrumentations to capture them even though it is not recommended.

          The attribute value MUST consist of either multiple header values as an array of strings
          or a single-item array containing a possibly comma-concatenated string, depending on the way
          the HTTP library provides access to headers.

          Examples:

          - A header `Content-Type: application/json` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.content-type`
            attribute with value `["application/json"]`.
          - A header `X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5` SHOULD be recorded as the `http.request.header.x-forwarded-for`
            attribute with value `["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]` or `["1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5"]` depending on the HTTP library.

        note: |
          HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
          By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods),
          the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html)
          and the QUERY method defined in [httpbis-safe-method-w-body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/?include_text=1).

          If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

          If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
          the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
          OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          If this override is done via declarative configuration, then the list MUST be configurable via the `known_methods` property
          (an array of strings with minimum items 0) under `.instrumentation/development.general.http.client` and/or
          `.instrumentation/development.general.http.server`.

          In either case, this list MUST be a full override of the default known methods,
          it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults.

          HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
          Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
          Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

        note: |
          MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by the HTTP server framework as the route attribute should have low-cardinality and the URI path can NOT substitute it.
          SHOULD include the [application root](/docs/http/http-spans.md#http-server-definitions) if there is one.

          A static path segment is a part of the route template with a fixed, low-cardinality value. This includes literal strings like `/users/` and placeholders that
          are constrained to a finite, predefined set of values, e.g. `{controller}` or `{action}`.

          A dynamic path segment is a placeholder for a value that can have high cardinality and is not constrained to a predefined list like static path segments.

          Instrumentations SHOULD use routing information provided by the corresponding web framework. They SHOULD pick the most precise source of routing information and MAY
          support custom route formatting. Instrumentations SHOULD document the format and the API used to obtain the route string.

      If there is no low-cardinality `target` available, the Span name SHOULD be `{mcp.method.name}`.

      Instrumentation MAY allow users to opt into including `{mcp.resource.uri}`
      as `target` in the span name when it is available but SHOULD NOT include it by default
      to avoid high cardinality span names.

      **Span status** SHOULD be set to `ERROR` when `error.type` attribute is present.
      The status description SHOULD match the `JSONRPCError.message` if the message is available.

      Refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document
      for more details.

      MCP tool call execution spans are compatible with GenAI [execute_tool spans](/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md#execute-tool-span).

      If the MCP instrumentation can reliably detect that outer GenAI instrumentation
      is already tracing the tool execution, it SHOULD NOT create a separate span.
      Instead, it SHOULD add MCP-specific attributes to the existing tool execution span.

      Instrumentations that support this behavior MAY provide a configuration
      option to enable it.

    type: span
    brief: This span describes the processing of the MCP request or notification initiated by the peer.
    note: |
      It's reported by the MCP server when client initiates the request
      (or notification) or by the MCP client when server initiates the operation.

      **Span name** SHOULD follow the format `{mcp.method.name} {target}`
      where target SHOULD match `{gen_ai.tool.name}` or `{gen_ai.prompt.name}` when
      applicable.
      If there is no low-cardinality `target` available, the Span name SHOULD be `{mcp.method.name}`.

      Instrumentation MAY allow users to opt into including `{mcp.resource.uri}`
      as `target` in the span name when it is available but SHOULD NOT include it by default
      to avoid high cardinality span names.

      **Span status** SHOULD be set to `ERROR` when `error.type` attribute is present.
      The status description SHOULD match the `JSONRPCError.message` if the message is available.

      Refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document
      for more details.

        note: |
          This attribute SHOULD be set to the output type requested by the client:

          - `json` for structured outputs with defined or undefined schema
          - `image` for image output
          - `speech` for speech output
          - `text` for plain text output

          The attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format.
          For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a
          URL pointing to an image file.

          Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the
          `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

          The value of this attribute matches source system tool definition format.

          It's expected to be an array of objects where each object represents a tool definition. In case a serialized string is available
          to the instrumentation, the instrumentation SHOULD do the best effort to
          deserialize it to an array. When recorded on spans, it MAY be recorded as a JSON string if structured format is not supported and SHOULD be recorded in structured form otherwise.

          Since this attribute could be large, it's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate
          it by default. Instrumentations MAY provide a way to enable
          populating this attribute.

    brief: This span represents an outgoing Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
    note: |
      RPC client spans SHOULD cover the entire client-side lifecycle of an RPC,
      starting when the RPC is initiated and ending when the response is received
      or the RPC is terminated due to an error or cancellation.

      For streaming RPCs, the span covers the full lifetime of the request and/or
      response streams until they are closed or terminated.

      If a transient issue happened and was retried within this RPC, the corresponding
      span SHOULD cover the duration of the logical call with all retries.

      **Span name:** refer to the [Span Name](/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md#name) section.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

      **Span status**: refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md)
      document for details on how to record span status.

          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to

        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified

          RPC client stub method on the client side.

        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          The method name MAY have unbounded cardinality in edge or error cases.

          Some RPC frameworks or libraries provide a fixed set of recognized methods
          for client stubs and server implementations. Instrumentations for such
          frameworks MUST set this attribute to the original method name only
          when the method is recognized by the framework or library.

          When the method is not recognized, for example, when the server receives
          a request for a method that is not predefined on the server, or when
          instrumentation is not able to reliably detect if the method is predefined,
          the attribute MUST be set to `_OTHER`. In such cases, tracing
          instrumentations MUST also set `rpc.method_original` attribute to
          the original method value.

          If the RPC instrumentation could end up converting valid RPC methods to
          `_OTHER`, then it SHOULD provide a way to configure the list of recognized
          RPC methods.

          The `rpc.method` can be different from the name of any implementing
          method/function.
          The `code.function.name` attribute may be used to record the fully-qualified
          method actually executing the call on the server side, or the
          RPC client stub method on the client side.

          for the details on which values of `rpc.response.status_code` are considered errors.

          The `error.type` value SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
          Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

          `db.query.parameter.<key>` SHOULD match

        note: |
          The query summary describes a class of database queries and is useful
          as a grouping key, especially when analyzing telemetry for database
          calls involving complex queries.

          Summary may be available to the instrumentation through
          instrumentation hooks or other means. If it is not available, instrumentations
          that support query parsing SHOULD generate a summary following
          [Generating query summary](/docs/db/database-spans.md#generating-a-summary-of-the-query)
          section.

          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query summary

            Non-parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be collected by default unless there is sanitization that excludes sensitive data, e.g. by redacting all literal values present in the query text. See [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
            Parameterized query text SHOULD be collected by default (the query parameter values themselves are opt-in, see [`db.query.parameter.<key>`](/docs/registry/attributes/db.md)).
        sampling_relevant: true
        note: |
          For sanitization see [Sanitization of `db.query.text`](/docs/db/database-spans.md#sanitization-of-dbquerytext).
          For batch operations, if the individual operations are known to have the same query text then that query text SHOULD be used, otherwise all of the individual query texts SHOULD be concatenated with separator `; ` or some other database system specific separator if more applicable.
          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

          Parameterized query text SHOULD NOT be sanitized. Even though parameterized query text can potentially have sensitive data, by using a parameterized query the user is giving a strong signal that any sensitive data will be passed as parameter values, and the benefit to observability of capturing the static part of the query text by default outweighs the risk.

        brief: Absolute URL describing a network resource according to [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986)
        examples:
          - https://www.foo.bar/search?q=OpenTelemetry#SemConv
          - //localhost
        tag: sensitive-information
        requirement_level: recommended
        note: |
          For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment
          is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.

          `url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`.
          In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.

          `url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed).

          Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.

          ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)
          Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the
          value `REDACTED`:

          * [`AWSAccessKeyId`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
          * [`Signature`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
          * [`sig`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#sas-token)
          * [`X-Goog-Signature`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)

          This list is subject to change over time.

          When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.
          `https://www.example.com/path?color=blue&sig=REDACTED`.
