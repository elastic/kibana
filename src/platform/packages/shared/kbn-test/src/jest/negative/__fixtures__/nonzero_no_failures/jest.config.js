// Negative-testing canary config. It lives under __fixtures__ so normal discovery
// (CI run order, orphan check, package runs) never picks it up; it is only run
// explicitly by scripts/jest_negative, which expects it to fail. Kept minimal and
// standalone (no shared preset) so the canary fails for its own reason and is not
// affected by the preset's __fixtures__ ignore or its jsdom/enzyme setup files.
