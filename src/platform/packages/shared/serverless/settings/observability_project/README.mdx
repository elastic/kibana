This package contains a list of UI settings that are only available in the Serverless Observability project.
This list is consumed by the `serverless_observability` plugin, which sets up its project settings:

```ts
export class ServerlessObservabilityPlugin
  implements
    Plugin<
      ServerlessObservabilityPluginSetup,
      ServerlessObservabilityPluginStart,
      SetupDependencies,
      StartDependencies
    >
{
  public setup(_coreSetup: CoreSetup, pluginsSetup: SetupDependencies) {
    pluginsSetup.serverless.setupProjectSettings(OBSERVABILITY_PROJECT_SETTINGS);
    return {};
  }
}
```

If you need to register a setting that should be available in the Serverless Observability project, make sure to add
its Id to this list.
