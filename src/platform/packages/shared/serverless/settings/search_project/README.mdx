This package contains a list of UI settings that are only available in the Serverless Search project.
This list is consumed by the `serverless_search` plugin, which sets up its project settings:

```ts
export class ServerlessSearchPlugin
  implements
    Plugin<
      ServerlessSearchPluginSetup,
      ServerlessSearchPluginStart,
      SetupDependencies,
      StartDependencies
    >
{
  public setup(
    { getStartServices, http }: CoreSetup<StartDependencies>,
    pluginsSetup: SetupDependencies
  ) {
    pluginsSetup.serverless.setupProjectSettings(SEARCH_PROJECT_SETTINGS);
    return {};
  }
}
```

If you need to register a setting that should be available in the Serverless Search project, make sure to add
its Id to this list.
