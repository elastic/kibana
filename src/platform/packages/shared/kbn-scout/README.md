# @kbn/scout

`kbn-scout` is a modern test framework for Kibana. It uses Playwright for UI integration tests. Its primary goal is to enhance the developer experience by offering a lightweight and flexible testing solution to create UI tests next to the plugin source code. This README explains the structure of the `kbn-scout` package and provides an overview of its key components.

### Overview

The `kbn-scout` framework provides:

- **Ease of integration:** a simplified mechanism to write and run tests closer to plugins.
- **Deployment-agnostic tests:** enables the testing of Kibana features across different environments (e.g., Stateful, Serverless).
- **Fixture-based design:** built on Playwright's fixture model to modularize and standardize test setup.
- **Focus on Developer Productivity:** faster test execution and minimal boilerplate for writing tests.

### Key Components

The `kbn-scout` package has been updated with a new structure to better organize components by their scope and functionality. Here's an overview of the key components:

1. **src/cli/**

Contains the logic to start servers, with or without running tests. It is accessed through the `scripts/scout` script.

2. **src/common/**

The `services` directory includes test helpers used across UI and API integration tests, such as Kibana and Elasticsearch `clients`, `esArchiver`, and `samlSessionManager`. These services are used to initialize instances and expose them to tests via Playwright worker fixtures. The `utils` directory contains shared utilities, while `constants.ts` defines common constants used throughout the framework.

3. **src/config/**

The `config` directory holds configurations for running servers locally. The `serverless` and `stateful` directories contain deployment-specific configurations. Configuration attributes are defined in the `schema` directory. The `discovery` directory contains logic for finding and validating test configurations, while `utils` provides configuration-related utilities. The `Config` class in `config.ts` serves as the main entry point. It is instantiated using the config loader in the `loader` directory. This instance is compatible with the `kbn-test` input format and is passed to functions for starting servers.

4. **src/execution/**

Contains CI execution-related logic to group tests into lanes that run efficiently within time constraints.

5. **src/playwright/**

#### Config

The `playwright` directory manages the default Playwright configuration. It exports the `createPlaywrightConfig` function, which is used by Kibana plugins to define Scout playwright configurations and serves as the entry point to run tests.

```ts
import { createPlaywrightConfig } from '@kbn/scout';

export default createPlaywrightConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  workers: 2,
});
```

Scout relies on configuration to determine the test files and opt-in [parallel test execution](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel) against the single Elastic cluster.

The Playwright configuration should only be created this way to ensure compatibility with Scout functionality. For configuration verification, we use a marker `VALID_CONFIG_MARKER`, and Scout will throw an error if the configuration is invalid.

#### Fixtures

The `fixtures/scope` directory contains core Scout capabilities required for testing the majority of Kibana plugins. [Fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures) can be scoped to either `test` or `worker`. Scope decides when to init a new fixture instance: once per worker or for every test function. It is important to choose the correct scope to keep test execution optimally fast: if **a new instance is not needed for every test**, the fixture should be scoped to **worker**. Otherwise, it should be scoped to **test**.

**Core `worker` scoped fixtures:**

- `log`
- `config`
- `esClient`
- `kbnClient`
- `esArchiver`
- `samlAuth`

```ts
test.beforeAll(async ({ kbnClient }) => {
  await kbnClient.importExport.load(testData.KBN_ARCHIVES.ECOMMERCE);
});
```

**Core `test` scoped fixtures:**

- `browserAuth`
- `pageObjects`
- `page`

```ts
test.beforeEach(async ({ browserAuth }) => {
  await browserAuth.loginAsViewer();
});
```

If a new fixture depends on a fixture with a `test` scope, it must also be `test` scoped.

#### Global Hooks and Test Utilities

The `global_hooks` directory contains setup and teardown logic that applies globally across test executions. It is a crucial feature for parallel tests, as it is required to ingest Elasticsearch data before any test runs. The `test` directory provides test-specific utilities, while `types` contains TypeScript type definitions. The `utils` directory includes various utility functions for test execution.

#### Page Objects

The `page_objects` directory contains all the Page Objects that represent Platform core functionality such as Discover, Dashboard, Index Management, etc.

If a Page Object is likely to be used in more than one plugin, it should be added here. This allows other teams to reuse it, improving collaboration across teams, reducing code duplication, and simplifying support and adoption.

Page Objects must be registered with the `createLazyPageObject` function, which guarantees its instance is lazy-initialized. This way, we can have all the page objects available in the test context, but only the ones that are called will be actually initialized:

```ts
export function createCorePageObjects(page: ScoutPage): PageObjects {
  return {
    dashboard: createLazyPageObject(DashboardApp, page),
    discover: createLazyPageObject(DiscoverApp, page),
    // Add new page objects here
  };
}
```

All registered Page Objects are available via the `pageObjects` fixture:

```ts
test.beforeEach(async ({ pageObjects }) => {
  await pageObjects.discover.goto();
});
```

6. **src/servers/**

Here we have logic to start Kibana and Elasticsearch servers using `kbn-test` functionality in Scout flavor. The instance of the `Config` class is passed to start servers for the specific deployment type. The `flags.ts` file contains server-related command-line flags and options. The `loadServersConfig` function not only returns a `kbn-test` compatible config instance, but also converts it to `ScoutServiceConfig` format and saves it on disk to `./scout/servers/local.json` in the Kibana root directory. Scout `config` fixture reads it and exposes it to UI tests.

### Test Types and Directory Structure

Scout supports two distinct types of tests: UI and API, each with their own directory structure and import patterns:

#### Setting up Test Directory

To get started with Scout testing for your plugin, you need to create the appropriate directory structure in your plugin's root directory:

```
your-plugin/
├── test/
│   └── scout/
│       ├── ui/
│       │   ├── playwright.config.ts
│       │   ├── parallel.playwright.config.ts
│       │   └── parallel_tests/               # Your UI test specs, that are run in parallel
│       │   └── tests/                        # Your UI test specs, that are run sequentially
│       ├── api/
│       │   ├── playwright.config.ts
│       │   └── tests/                        # Your API test specs, that are run sequentially
│       └── common/                           # For shared code across UI and API tests
│           ├── constants.ts
│           └── fixtures/                        
```

#### UI Tests

UI tests are designed for browser-based integration testing and provide access to browser fixtures like `page`, `pageObjects`, and `browserAuth`.

**Test Imports for UI Testing:**

```ts
// For sequential UI tests
import { test, expect } from '@kbn/scout';

// For parallel UI tests that can be space-isolated
import { spaceTest as test, expect } from '@kbn/scout';
```

**When to use each:**

- **`spaceTest`**: Use for parallel tests that can be isolated by Kibana spaces, allowing faster execution
- **`test`**: Use for sequential tests that cannot run in parallel

**Example UI Test:**

```ts
import { spaceTest as test, expect } from '@kbn/scout';

test('should display dashboard', async ({ pageObjects, page }) => {
  await pageObjects.dashboard.goto();
  await expect(page.testSubj.locator('dashboardLandingPage')).toBeVisible();
});
```

#### API Tests

API tests are designed for server-side testing and provide fixtures focused on API interactions without browser-related fixtures.

**Test Import for API Testing:**

```ts
// For API integration tests (server-side only, no browser fixtures)
import { apiTest as test, expect } from '@kbn/scout';
```

**Example API Test:**

```ts
import { apiTest, expect } from '@kbn/scout';

apiTest('POST api/painless_lab/execute is disabled', async ({ apiClient, log }) => {
  const response = await apiClient.post('api/painless_lab/execute', {
    headers: {
      ...COMMON_HEADERS,
      ...adminApiCredentials.apiKeyHeader,
    },
    responseType: 'json',
    body: TEST_INPUT.script,
  });
  expect(response.statusCode).toBe(404);
});
```

**Key Differences:**

- **UI tests** include browser fixtures (`page`, `pageObjects`, `browserAuth`) for UI interactions
- **API tests** exclude browser fixtures and focus on server-side operations (`kbnClient`, `esClient`, `log`, etc.)

#### Testing Guidelines for Plugin Development

When writing tests for your plugin, consider the following guidelines to ensure comprehensive coverage:

**Focus on Plugin Functionality:**

- Tests should primarily cover the specific functionality exposed by your plugin
- Focus on plugin-specific user workflows, configurations, and integrations

**API Testing Coverage:**

- Test all API endpoints exposed by your plugin
- Verify endpoints work correctly in both **serverless** and **stateful** deployments
- Include tests for scenarios where functionality should be **disabled** or **restricted**
- Test different user roles and permissions for your endpoints
- Cover both success and error scenarios (validation, authentication, authorization failures)

### How to Use

Scout uses Playwright's [projects concept](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects) to define the environment where tests are executed. The following projects are supported:

- **`local`**: Tests are executed against servers started locally. Configuration is auto-generated by Scout and saved to `KIBANA_REPO_ROOT/.scout/servers/local.json`.
- **`ech`**: Tests are executed against a Stateful deployment created in Elastic Cloud. Configuration is **manually** defined in `KIBANA_REPO_ROOT/.scout/servers/cloud_ech.json`.

```json
{
  "serverless": false,
  "isCloud": true,
  "cloudHostName": "elastic_cloud_hostname_qa_staging_prod",
  "cloudUsersFilePath": "/path_to_your_cloud_users/role_users.json",
  "hosts": {
    "kibana": "https://my.cloud.deployment.kb.co",
    "elasticsearch": "https://my.cloud.deployment.es.co"
  },
  "auth": {
    "username": "deployment_username",
    "password": "deployment_password"
  }
}
```

- **`mki`**: Tests are executed against a Serverless project created in Elastic Cloud (MKI). Configuration is **manually** defined in `KIBANA_REPO_ROOT/.scout/servers/cloud_mki.json`.

```json
{
  "serverless": true
  "projectType": "es",
  "isCloud": true,
  "cloudHostName": "elastic_cloud_hostname_qa_staging_prod",
  "cloudUsersFilePath": "/path_to_your_cloud_users/role_users.json",
  "hosts": {
    "kibana": "https://my.es.project.kb.co",
    "elasticsearch": "https://my.es.project.es.co"
  },
  "auth": {
    "username": "operator_username",
    "password": "operator_password"
  }
}
```

#### Starting Servers Only

To start the servers locally without running tests, use the following command:

```bash
node scripts/scout.js start-server [--stateful|--serverless=[es|oblt|security]]
```

- **`--stateful`**: Starts servers in a stateful mode.
- **`--serverless`**: Starts servers in a serverless mode. You can specify additional options like `es` (Elasticsearch), `oblt` (Observability), or `security`.

This command is useful for manual testing or running tests via an IDE.

#### Running Servers and Tests Locally

To start the servers locally and run tests in one step, use:

```bash
node scripts/scout.js run-tests [--stateful|--serverless=[es|oblt|security]] --config <plugin-path>/test/scout/ui/playwright.config.ts
```

- **`--stateful`** or **`--serverless`**: Specifies the deployment type.
- **`--config`**: Path to the Playwright configuration file for the plugin.

This command starts the required servers and automatically executes the tests using Playwright.

#### Running Tests Separately

If the servers are already running, you can execute tests independently using one of the following methods:

1. **Playwright Plugin in IDE**: Run tests directly within your IDE using Playwright's integration.
2. **Command Line**: Use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test --config <plugin-path>/test/scout/ui/playwright.config.ts --project local
```

- **`--project`**: Specifies the test target as `local` ( `ech` or `mki` for Cloud targets, see below).

#### Running Tests Against Cloud

To run tests against a Cloud deployment, you can use either the Scout CLI or the Playwright CLI.

**Using Scout CLI:**

```bash
node scripts/scout.js run-tests \
  --stateful \
  --testTarget=cloud \
  --config <plugin-path>/test/scout/ui/playwright.config.ts
```

```bash
node scripts/scout.js run-tests \
  --serverless=oblt \
  --testTarget=cloud \
  --config <plugin-path>/test/scout/ui/playwright.config.ts
```

- **`--testTarget=cloud`**: Specifies that tests should run against a Cloud deployment.

**Using Playwright CLI:**

```bash
npx playwright test \
  --project=ech \
  --grep=@ess \
  --config <plugin-path>/test/scout/ui/playwright.config.ts
```

```bash
npx playwright test \
  --project=mki \
  --grep=@svlOblt \
  --config <plugin-path>/test/scout/ui/playwright.config.ts
```

- **`--project`**: Specifies the test target (`ech` for Stateful or `mki` for Serverless).
- **`--grep`**: Filters tests by tags (e.g., `@svlSearch` for Elasticsearch or `@svlOblt` for Observability).

By following these steps, you can efficiently run tests in various environments using Scout.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve and extend `kbn-scout`. This guide will help you get started, add new features, and align with existing project standards.

Make sure to run unit tests before opening the PR:

```bash
node scripts/jest --config src/platform/packages/shared/kbn-scout/jest.config.js
```

#### Setting Up the Environment

Ensure you have the latest local copy of the Kibana repository.

Install dependencies by running the following commands:

- `yarn kbn bootstrap` to install dependencies.
- `node scripts/build_kibana_platform_plugins.js` to build plugins.

Move to the `src/platform/packages/shared/kbn-scout` directory to begin development.

### Adding or Modifying Components

Contributions to shareable `Fixtures`, `API services` and `Page Objects` are highly encouraged to promote reusability, stability, and ease of adoption. Follow these steps:

#### Adding Page Objects

1. **Create a New Page Object:** Add a new file to the `src/playwright/page_objects` directory. For instance:

```ts
export class NewPage {
  constructor(private readonly page: ScoutPage) {}
  // implementation
}
```

2. **Register the Page Object:** Update the index file to include the new Page Object:

```ts
export function createCorePageObjects(page: ScoutPage): PageObjects {
  return {
    ...
    newPage: createLazyPageObject(NewPage, page),
  };
}
```

#### Adding API service

1. **Create a New API service:** Add your service to the `src/platform/packages/shared/kbn-scout/src/playwright/fixtures/scope/worker/apis` directory, organized by functionality (e.g., `/fleet` or `/alerting`). For instance:

```ts
export interface FleetApiService {
  integration: {
    install: (name: string) => Promise<void>;
    delete: (name: string) => Promise<void>;
  };
}

export const getFleetApiHelper = (log: ScoutLogger, kbnClient: KbnClient): FleetApiService => {
  return {
    integration: {
      install: async (name: string) => {
        // implementation
      },
      delete: async (name: string) => {
        // implementation
      },
    },
  };
};
```

2. **Register the API service:** Update the index file to include the new service:

```ts
export const apiServicesFixture = coreWorkerFixtures.extend<
  {},
  { apiServices: ApiServicesFixture }
>({
  apiServices: [
    async ({ kbnClient, log }, use) => {
      const services = {
        // add new service
        fleet: getFleetApiHelper(log, kbnClient),
      };
      ...
  ],
});
```

#### Adding Fixture

1. **Determine Fixture Scope:** Decide if your fixture should apply to the `test` (per-test) or `worker` (per-worker) scope.

2. **Implement the Fixture:** Add the implementation to `src/playwright/fixtures/scope/test` or `src/playwright/fixtures/scope/worker`.

```ts
export const newTestFixture = base.extend<ScoutTestFixtures, ScoutWorkerFixtures>({
  newFixture: async ({}, use) => {
    const myFn = // implementation
      await use(myFn);
    // optionally, cleanup on test completion
  },
});
```

3. **Register the Fixture:** Add the fixture to the appropriate scope:

```ts
export const scoutTestFixtures = mergeTests(coreFixtures, newTestFixture);
```

#### Best Practices

- **Reusable Code:** When creating Page Objects, API services or Fixtures that apply to more than one plugin, ensure they are added to the `kbn-scout` package.
- **Adhere to Existing Structure:** Maintain consistency with the project's architecture.
- **Keep the Scope of Components Clear** When designing test components, keep in mind naming conventions, scope, maintainability and performance.
  - `Page Objects` should focus exclusively on UI interactions (clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating page). They should not make API calls directly.
  - `API Services` should handle server interactions, such as sending API requests and processing responses.
  - `Fixtures` can combine browser interactions with API requests, but they should be used wisely, especially with the `test` scope: a new instance of the fixture is created for **every test block**. If a fixture performs expensive operations (API setup, data ingestion), excessive usage can **slow down** the test suite runtime. Consider using `worker` scope when appropriate to reuse instances across tests within a worker.
- **Add Unit Tests:** Include tests for new logic where applicable, ensuring it works as expected.
- **Playwright documentation:** [Official best practices](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices)

### Running tests on CI

#### Enabling tests for execution

Scout is still in active development, which means frequent code changes may sometimes cause test failures. To maintain stability, we currently do not run Scout tests for every PR and encourage teams to limit the number of tests they add for now.

If a test is difficult to stabilize within a reasonable timeframe, we reserve the right to disable it or even all tests for particular plugin.

To manage Scout test execution, we use the `.buildkite/scout_ci_config.yml` file, where Kibana plugins with Scout tests are registered. If you're unsure about the stability of your tests, please add your plugin under the `disabled` section.

You can check whether your plugin is already registered by running:

```bash
node scripts/scout discover-playwright-configs --validate
```

On CI we run Scout tests only for `enabled` plugins:

For PRs, Scout tests run only if there are changes to registered plugins or Scout-related packages.
On merge commits, Scout tests run in a non-blocking mode.

#### Scout exit codes
