# @kbn/elapsed-datetime-formatter

This package is intended to show the elapsed time from a provided date in days or hours and minutes. It also provides the ability to show a tooltip with the original timestamp in ISO format.

## Examples

An alert was created or triggered 2 minutes before the current time, but only has a timestamp. Use this package to show the elapsed time of `2 minutes ago` in human-readable, translatable text.
