## Description

This package exports error boundary components to handle rendering errors gracefully:

- `KibanaErrorBoundary` - Captures rendering errors at the page level and blocks the main UI
- `KibanaSectionErrorBoundary` - Captures errors at a granular section level with optional automatic retry capability

In general, it's best to use `KibanaErrorBoundary` and block the whole page. If it is acceptable to assume the risk of allowing users to interact with a UI that has an error state, then using `KibanaSectionErrorBoundary` may be an acceptable alternative, but this must be judged on a case-by-case basis.

## API

### KibanaErrorBoundary

Page-level error boundary that captures rendering errors and blocks the main UI until refresh.

```tsx
<KibanaErrorBoundary>
  <YourApp />
</KibanaErrorBoundary>
```

**Props:**

- `children` (ReactNode, required) - Child components to render and protect

### KibanaSectionErrorBoundary

Section-level error boundary that captures errors without blocking the entire page. Supports optional automatic retry with fresh component state.

```tsx
// Without retries (default)
<KibanaSectionErrorBoundary sectionName="Dashboard Panel">
  <YourComponent />
</KibanaSectionErrorBoundary>

// With automatic retry attempts
<KibanaSectionErrorBoundary sectionName="Dashboard Panel" maxRetries={3}>
  <YourComponent />
</KibanaSectionErrorBoundary>
```

**Props:**

- `sectionName` (string, required) - Name of the section for error messaging
- `maxRetries` (number, optional, default: 0) - Number of times to automatically remount children when an error occurs. When > 0, the section will attempt to recover by remounting with fresh state before showing the error prompt.
- `children` (ReactNode, required) - Child components to render and protect

**Retry Behavior:**
When `maxRetries > 0`, if an error is caught, the component will:

1. Automatically remount children with a fresh Fragment key (forcing fresh component state)
2. Increment retry counter
3. If another error occurs and retries are exhausted, show the error prompt
4. If no error occurs during retry, render normally

This is useful for components that may have transient errors that resolve with fresh state, or where component state corruption could be recovered by remounting.

## EUI Promotion Status

This component is specialized for error messages internal to Kibana and is not intended for promotion to EUI.
