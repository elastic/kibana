# Data Cascade

The data cascade component in Kibana presents information as a list of expandable or collapsible cells. 
It supports up to 3 levels of nesting and is highly customizable and suitable for diverse applications across all Elastic solutions,
including data tables and dashboards. 

The shared component itself is a wrapper, establishing a generic behavior and styling for the cell.

## Style

#### Outline
The data cascade groups, presented as a list of cells, form a single outlined component. Each cell within this component is an individual box. 
When a cell is expanded, its borders must remain visible to clearly show the hierarchical relationships between the different levels. 
Even if there’s only one group in a list, it should remain outlined. 
Content slot within a cell should also be considered a level (a "null" level) and outlined to demonstrate its hierarchical position.


## Component composition

The Data Cascade component is composed of three main parts: `DataCascade`, `DataCascadeRow`, and `DataCascadeRowCell`. 
These components are required to build a functional data cascade.

One can think of the `DataCascade` as the table, `DataCascadeRow` as the table row, and `DataCascadeRowCell` as the table cell. That been said we'd put
them together as follows:


```tsx
import { DataCascade, DataCascadeRow, DataCascadeRowCell } from '@kbn/shared-ux-document-data-cascade';

<DataCascade {...dataCascadeProps}>
  <DataCascadeRow {...dataCascadeRowProps}>
    <DataCascadeRowCell {...dataCascadeRowCellProps}>
      {({ data }) => {
        // your custom component cell rendering logic
      }}
    </DataCascadeRowCell>
  </DataCascadeRow>
</DataCascade>
```

Which would in turn yield something of this sort;

## Features

The cascade component by default supports up to 3 levels of visual nesting, for the data it's rendering, further more all levels of rendering are 
virtualized for performance, and it's also possible to have a cell's content virtualized, and connect it to the overall virtualization strategy,
such that the scroll of the entire component also controls the cell and it turns determines the content the cell renders.

## Component Props

{/* Note: Excluding `query` from the controls as it's not a prop of the component, but rather a simulation of user input for generating group by fields. */}
<Controls exclude={['query']} />
