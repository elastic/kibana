## Project Overview

This is a UI component. It's a date range picker with a "smart input".

# Storybook
yarn storybook shared_ux
```

## Component Architecture

TODO (input text is source of truth, state flow)

## Rules

1. Avoid complexity in TypeScript types
2. Add JSDoc DocBlocks for every function
3. Describe all props in exported types with JSDoc, including @default when not undefined
4. Do not expose `moment` objects in public APIs, we might replace it
5. Keep tests concise

## Philosophy

- Correctness > cleverness
- Real problems only
- Descriptive names > brevity
- Keep PRs small (below 1000 lines)
