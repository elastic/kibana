This UI component is a date range picker with a "smart input" feature that partially supports natural language e.g. "last 2 weeks".

It's meant to replace `[EuiSuperDatePicker](https://eui.elastic.co/docs/components/forms/date-and-time/super-date-picker/)`, and probably also `[EuiDatePickerRange](https://eui.elastic.co/docs/components/forms/date-and-time/date-picker-range/)`.

## Preview
