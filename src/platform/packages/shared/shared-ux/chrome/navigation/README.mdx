# Kibana Chrome Navigation

## Description

This package provides a generic, reusable `Navigation` component and the React provider pattern (`NavigationProvider` and `NavigationKibanaProvider`) necessary to decouple it from Kibana's core services. Its primary purpose is to create a clean separation between UI rendering and application-specific state management.

## How It Works: A Decoupled Architecture

### External Dependencies

The `Navigation` component does not interact with core services directly. Instead, it receives data from these external sources:

- **`ProjectNavigationService`**: The ultimate source of truth for navigation state. It produces observables like `activeNodes$`.
- **`ChromeService`**: A high-level service that consumes state from the `ProjectNavigationService` and exposes a simplified, more generic set of observables and functions for the UI to consume.

### Internal Components & Data Flow

The components within this package work together to consume the external dependencies and render the UI:

1.  **`NavigationKibanaProvider` (The Adapter)**: This is the key component in this package. It acts as an adapter that subscribes to the streams from the **external** `ChromeService` and maps them to a generic interface. Key dependencies it consumes include:

    - `navLinks.getNavLinks$()`: Provides the list of navigation links to render.
    - `sideNav.getIsCollapsed$()`: Provides the collapsed state of the sidebar.
    - `sideNav.getPanelSelectedNode$()`: Provides the currently selected panel or node.

2.  **`NavigationProvider` (The Testing Provider)**: This provider is primarily designed for testing and Storybook scenarios. Unlike `NavigationKibanaProvider` which connects to real Kibana services, `NavigationProvider` allows you to directly pass in mock services and state. This makes it easy to test components in isolation without requiring the full Kibana infrastructure. In production code, you would typically use `NavigationKibanaProvider`, which internally uses `NavigationProvider` after mapping Kibana-specific services to the generic interface.

3.  **`Navigation` (The UI Component)**: This is the presentational component. It is completely unaware of Kibana's services and simply consumes the generic context from `NavigationProvider` to render the final UI.

For more information on how to implement custom navigation for your solution or serverless project, see the [Solution Navigation Guide](./solution_navigation.mdx) which provides detailed API documentation and best practices for building tailored navigation experiences.

## EUI Promotion Status

This component is not currently considered for promotion to EUI.
