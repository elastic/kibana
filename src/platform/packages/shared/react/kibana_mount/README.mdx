## Description

This module provides a utility function to convert React nodes into mount points, which can be rendered into a
specified HTML element. It leverages the Kibana rendering context to ensure that the necessary context
providers are applied.

### Usage

#### First usage example: passing the `coreStart` prop:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { toMountPoint } from '@kbn/react-kibana-mount';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello, world!</div>;

const mountPoint = toMountPoint(<MyComponent />, {
  coreStart: {}, // provide your CoreStart context
});

const element = document.getElementById('root');
mountPoint(element);
```

### Different forms of passing CoreStart service dependencies

`toMountPoint` wraps `KibanaRenderContextProvider`, which encapsulates features that depend on CoreStart services. The original form of
passing the services required each dependent service to be passed separate. This form is now deprecated:

#### Second usage example: passing CoreStart service dependencies separately (deprecated):

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { toMountPoint } from '@kbn/react-kibana-mount';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello, world!</div>;

// NOTE: this is deprecated, avoid passing services separately!
const mountPoint = toMountPoint(<MyComponent />, {
  analytics: {}, // provide analytics service
  executionContext: {}, // provide executionContext service
  i18n: {}, // provide i18n service
  theme: {}, // provide theme service
  userProfile: {}, // provide user profile service
});

const element = document.getElementById('root');
mountPoint(element);
```

We discourage passing the dependent services separately because that heavily impacts the codebase whenever new
features are encapsulated in `KibanaRenderContextProvider`. The encouraged way to pass the CoreStart services is
to use the `coreStart` prop, as shown in the first example.
