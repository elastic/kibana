title: React Context - Rendering Provider
description: This context provider is used to render a new component tree _without_ the initialization of EUI or Emotion.  This provider is typically used with `ReactDOM.render()` calls.

## Description

The `KibanaRenderContextProvider` is designed to be used with ad-hoc renders of React components, (usually with `ReactDOM.render`).

When Kibana starts, the `KibanaRootContextProvider` is used by the `RenderService` to initialize EUI and Emotion... it should only be rendered _once_.  Still, there are times when you need to render a new component tree and need things like `i18n` and the current theme to be made available in a consistent way.  The `KibanaRenderContextProvider` is designed to be used in these cases.  In addition, it allows us to abstract away any changes or other complexities with React context that we may introduce in the future.

### Usage

#### First usage example: passing the `coreStart` prop:

```tsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { KibanaRenderContextProvider } from '@kbn/react-kibana-context-render';

import { MyComponent } from './my_component';

const App = (core: CoreStart) => {
  return (
    <KibanaRenderContextProvider coreStart={core}>
      <MyComponent />
    </KibanaRenderContextProvider>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('some_node'));
```

### Different forms of passing CoreStart service dependencies

`KibanaRenderContextProvider` encapsulates features that depend on CoreStart services. The original form of
passing the services required each dependent service to be passed separate. This form is now deprecated:

#### Second usage example: passing CoreStart service dependencies separately (deprecated):

```tsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { KibanaRenderContextProvider } from '@kbn/react-kibana-context-render';

import { MyComponent } from './my_component';

const App = ({i18n, theme, analytics, userProfile, executionContext}: CoreStart) => {
  // NOTE: this is deprecated, avoid passing services separately!
  return (
    <KibanaRenderContextProvider {...{i18n, theme, analytics, userProfile, executionContext}}>
      <MyComponent />
    </KibanaRenderContextProvider>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('some_node'));
```

We discourage passing the dependent services separately because that heavily impacts the codebase whenever new
features are encapsulated in `KibanaRenderContextProvider`. The encouraged way to pass the CoreStart services is
to use the `coreStart` prop, as shown in the first example.
