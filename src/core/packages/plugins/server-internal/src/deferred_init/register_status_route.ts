/**
 * Register the always-available core endpoint the initializing UI polls:
 * `GET /internal/core/deferred_init/{pluginId}` -> {@link DeferredInitStatusResponse}.
 *
 * This is a core-owned route (never wrapped by {@link createGuardedRouter}), so it stays
 * reachable while a plugin is still initializing.
 *
 * Deliberately calls `ensureInitialized` rather than the read-only `getState`: after a plugin
 * cools down from a failed run or a lost cross-instance lock race (see `DeferredInitEngine`),
 * something has to flip it back to trying again. Gated routes provide that nudge for plugins
 * that are actively receiving traffic, but a plugin with no gated request in flight would
 * otherwise stall forever waiting on traffic that never arrives. The initializing UI is
 * already polling this route once a user is on the loading screen, so reusing that poll as the
 * nudge covers that gap without introducing an unconditional background retry loop that would
 * spend Elasticsearch calls on plugins nobody is waiting on. `ensureInitialized` itself only
 * auto-kicks an `idle` plugin, not a `failed` one, so a genuine failure is actually observable
 * here instead of being silently re-kicked away before this handler ever reads it.
