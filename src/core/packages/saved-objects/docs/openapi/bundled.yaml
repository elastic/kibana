      summary: Rotate a key for encrypted saved objects
      operationId: rotateEncryptionKey
      description: |
        Superuser role required.

        If a saved object cannot be decrypted using the primary encryption key, then Kibana will attempt to decrypt it using the specified decryption-only keys. In most of the cases this overhead is negligible, but if you're dealing with a large number of saved objects and experiencing performance issues, you may want to rotate the encryption key.

        This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

          description: |
            Specifies a maximum number of saved objects that Kibana can process in a single batch. Bulk key rotation is an iterative process since Kibana may not be able to fetch and process all required saved objects in one go and splits processing into consequent batches. By default, the batch size is 10000, which is also a maximum allowed value.

            Limits encryption key rotation only to the saved objects with the specified type. By default, Kibana tries to rotate the encryption key for all saved object types that may contain encrypted attributes.

                      NOTE: In most cases, `total` will be greater than `successful` even if `failed` is zero. The reason is that Kibana may not need or may not be able to rotate encryption keys for all encrypted saved objects.

            When true, force delete objects that exist in multiple namespaces. Note that the option applies to the whole request. Use the delete object API to specify per-object deletion behavior. TIP: Use this if you attempted to delete objects and received an HTTP 400 error with the following message: "Unable to delete saved object that exists in multiple namespaces, use the force option to delete it anyway". WARNING: When you bulk delete objects that exist in multiple namespaces, the API also deletes legacy url aliases that reference the object. These requests are batched to minimise the impact but they can place a heavy load on Kibana. Make sure you limit the number of objects that exist in multiple namespaces in a single bulk delete operation.

        Retrieve multiple Kibana saved objects by identifier using any legacy URL aliases if they exist. Under certain circumstances when Kibana is upgraded, saved object migrations may necessitate regenerating some object IDs to enable new features. When an object's ID is regenerated, a legacy URL alias is created for that object, preserving its old ID. In such a scenario, that object can be retrieved by the bulk resolve API using either its new ID or its old ID.
