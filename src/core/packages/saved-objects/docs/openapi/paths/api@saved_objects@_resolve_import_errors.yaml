  summary: Resolve import errors
  operationId: resolveImportErrors
  description: |
    To resolve errors from the Import objects API, you can:

    * Retry certain saved objects
    * Overwrite specific saved objects
    * Change references to different saved objects
  tags:
    - saved objects
  parameters:
    - $ref: '../components/headers/kbn_xsrf.yaml'
    - in: query
      name: compatibilityMode
      schema:
        type: boolean
      required: false

        Applies various adjustments to the saved objects that are being imported to maintain compatibility between different Kibana versions. When enabled during the initial import, also enable when resolving import errors. This option cannot be used with the `createNewCopies` option.

        Creates copies of the saved objects, regenerates each object ID, and resets the origin. When enabled during the initial import, also enable when resolving import errors.

                  Indicates a successful import. When set to `false`, some objects may not have been created. For additional information, refer to the `errors` and `successResults` properties.

                  Specifies the objects that failed to resolve.

                  NOTE: One object can result in multiple errors, which requires separate steps to resolve. For instance, a `missing_references` error and a `conflict` error.

                  Indicates the objects that are successfully imported, with any metadata if applicable.

                  NOTE: Objects are only created when all resolvable errors are addressed, including conflict and missing references.
