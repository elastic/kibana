  summary: Export saved objects
  operationId: exportSavedObjectsDefault
  description: |
    Retrieve sets of saved objects that you want to import into Kibana.
    You must include `type` or `objects` in the request body.

    Exported saved objects are not backwards compatible and cannot be imported into an older version of Kibana.

    NOTE: The `savedObjects.maxImportExportSize` configuration setting limits the number of saved objects which may be exported.
