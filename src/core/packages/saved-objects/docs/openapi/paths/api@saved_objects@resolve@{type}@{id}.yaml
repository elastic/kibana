  summary: Resolve a saved object
  operationId: resolveSavedObject
  description: >
    Retrieve a single Kibana saved object by identifier using any legacy URL alias if it exists.
    Under certain circumstances, when Kibana is upgraded, saved object migrations may necessitate regenerating some object IDs to enable new features.
    When an object's ID is regenerated, a legacy URL alias is created for that object, preserving its old ID.
    In such a scenario, that object can be retrieved using either its new ID or its old ID.
