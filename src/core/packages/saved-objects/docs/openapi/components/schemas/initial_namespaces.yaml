  Identifiers for the spaces in which this object is created.
  If this is provided, the object is created only in the explicitly defined spaces.
  If this is not provided, the object is created in the current space (default behavior).
  For shareable object types (registered with `namespaceType: 'multiple'`), this option can be used to specify one or more spaces, including the "All spaces" identifier ('*').
  For isolated object types (registered with `namespaceType: 'single'` or `namespaceType: 'multiple-isolated'`), this option can only be used to specify a single space, and the "All spaces" identifier ('*') is not allowed.
  For global object types (`registered with `namespaceType: agnostic`), this option cannot be used.
