type: object
properties:
  success:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates when the import was successfully completed. When set to false, some objects may not have been created. For additional information, refer to the `errors` and `successResults` properties.
  successCount:
    type: integer
    description: Indicates the number of successfully imported records.
  errors:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
    description: |
      Indicates the import was unsuccessful and specifies the objects that failed to import.

      NOTE: One object may result in multiple errors, which requires separate steps to resolve. For instance, a `missing_references` error and conflict error.
  successResults:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
    description: |
      Indicates the objects that are successfully imported, with any metadata if applicable.

      NOTE: Objects are created only when all resolvable errors are addressed, including conflicts and missing references. If objects are created as new copies, each entry in the `successResults` array includes a `destinationId` attribute.
