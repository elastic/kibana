    description: |
      A file exported using the export API. Changing the contents of the exported file in any way before importing it can cause errors, crashes or data loss. NOTE: The `savedObjects.maxImportExportSize` configuration setting limits the number of saved objects which may be included in this file. Similarly, the `savedObjects.maxImportPayloadBytes` setting limits the overall size of the file that can be imported.
