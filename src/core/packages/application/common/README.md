# @kbn/core-application-common

## Description
The common package contains shared types, constants, and utilities for Kibana's application service that are used across both browser and server environments. It provides the foundational type definitions and enumerations that ensure consistency between client and server-side application handling.

## Contents
- `index.ts`: Main entry point exposing common application types and constants
- `src/types.ts`: Core type definitions for applications, capabilities, and navigation
- `src/constants.ts`: Application-related constants and enumerations used throughout the platform

## Architecture
The package serves as a shared foundation for application-related functionality:

**Core Types:**
- **AppNavLinkStatus**: Enumeration for application navigation link visibility states
- **AppStatus**: Enumeration for application availability states  
- **Application Types**: Base interfaces for application metadata and configuration
- **Navigation Types**: Types for URL generation and routing
- **Capability Types**: Type definitions for application permissions and features

**Design Principles:**
- **Environment Agnostic**: Works in both browser and Node.js environments
- **Type Safety**: Provides comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform application behavior across client and server
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight package with no runtime dependencies

**Key Enumerations:**
```typescript
export enum AppNavLinkStatus {
  default = 0,
  visible = 1,
  disabled = 2,
  hidden = 3,
}

export enum AppStatus {
  accessible = 0,
  inaccessible = 1,
}
```

## Usage
This package is typically imported by other application packages and plugins that need shared types:

```typescript
import { AppNavLinkStatus, AppStatus } from '@kbn/core-application-common';

// Define application with common types
const myApp = {
  id: 'myApp',
  title: 'My Application',
  status: AppStatus.accessible,
  navLinkStatus: AppNavLinkStatus.visible,
  capabilities: {
    show: true,
    save: true,
  },
};

// Type-safe status checking
if (myApp.status === AppStatus.accessible) {
  // Application is available for use
}

if (myApp.navLinkStatus === AppNavLinkStatus.hidden) {
  // Navigation link should not be displayed
}
```

## Key Types and Constants

### Application Status Management
- **AppStatus**: Controls application availability and access
- **AppNavLinkStatus**: Controls navigation link visibility in the UI
- **Application Metadata**: Common properties shared across application definitions

### Navigation and Routing
- **URL Types**: Common interfaces for application URL handling
- **Route Types**: Shared routing configuration types
- **Navigation State**: Types for managing application navigation state
