# @kbn/core-application-browser-internal

## Description
The browser-internal package contains the complete implementation of Kibana's core application service for the browser. It handles application registration, routing, navigation, and lifecycle management. This package is responsible for the actual runtime behavior of applications within the Kibana platform and should only be used by Kibana core itself.

## Contents
- `index.ts`: Main entry point exposing internal application service implementation
- `src/application_service.ts`: Core service implementation managing application lifecycle and state
- `src/integration_tests/`: Integration tests for application service functionality
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions for URL handling, navigation, and application management

## Architecture
The package implements a comprehensive application management system:

**Core Components:**
- **ApplicationService**: Main service orchestrating application registration and lifecycle
- **Application Registry**: Manages registered applications and their metadata
- **Navigation Manager**: Handles routing and navigation between applications
- **URL Management**: Provides utilities for application URL generation and parsing

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Observable-based state management for application lifecycle
- Plugin-agnostic application registration system
- Centralized routing and navigation management

**Dependencies:**
- `@kbn/core-application-browser`: Public API contracts
- `@kbn/core-application-common`: Shared types and utilities
- `@kbn/core-http-browser`: HTTP client for server communication
- `@kbn/core-mount-utils-browser`: Component mounting utilities

## Usage
This package is primarily used internally by Kibana core and should not be directly imported by plugins:

```typescript
// Internal usage within Kibana core
import { ApplicationService } from '@kbn/core-application-browser-internal';

const applicationService = new ApplicationService({
  http: httpService,
  history: history,
  // other dependencies...
});

// Setup phase
const applicationSetup = applicationService.setup();

// Start phase  
const applicationStart = applicationService.start();
```
