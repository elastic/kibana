# @kbn/core-application-browser

## Description
The browser package provides the public API and types for Kibana's core application service on the client-side. It enables plugins to register and manage applications, handle navigation, and integrate with Kibana's routing system. This package serves as the main interface for application lifecycle management in the browser.

## Contents
- `index.ts`: Main entry point exposing public application types and interfaces
- `src/contracts.ts`: Defines the core application service contracts including ApplicationSetup and ApplicationStart interfaces
- `src/types.ts`: Contains comprehensive type definitions for applications, navigation, and application capabilities

## Architecture
The package follows a contract-based architecture where:
- **ApplicationSetup**: Provides registration capabilities during plugin setup phase
- **ApplicationStart**: Provides navigation and application management during plugin start phase
- **Type-only exports**: This package contains no runtime code, only TypeScript interfaces and types
- **Dependency separation**: Cleanly separates public API from internal implementation

Key architectural patterns:
- Contract-based design for plugin lifecycle integration
- Capability-based application registration system
- Immutable application configurations
- Type-safe navigation and URL generation

## Usage
This package is typically used by Kibana plugins to interact with the application service:

```typescript
import type { ApplicationSetup, ApplicationStart } from '@kbn/core-application-browser';

// During plugin setup
class MyPlugin implements Plugin {
  setup(core: CoreSetup) {
    const { application }: { application: ApplicationSetup } = core;
    
    application.register({
      id: 'myApp',
      title: 'My Application',
      mount: async ({ element }) => {
        // Mount your application
      },
    });
  }

  start(core: CoreStart) {
    const { application }: { application: ApplicationStart } = core;
    
    // Navigate to applications
    application.navigateToApp('myApp');
  }
}
```
