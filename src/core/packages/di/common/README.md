# Kibana's Dependency Injection Subsystem

## Motivation
- *Decoupling* should improve reusability, testability, and maintainability.
- Prevent *circular dependencies*.
- *Inversion of Control* should help to get rid of dependencies forwarding and build clear abstraction layers.
- *Clean Code* should provide declarativity and minimize the amount of boilerplate code.

## Dependencies
The Kibana's Dependency Injection Subsystem is built on top of [InversifyJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inversify) library.
It does not wrap or encapsulate it in any way, but provides support for the [Container Modules](https://inversify.io/docs/api/container-module/) declared using that library.

That means there is no service API layer exposed on the Kibana side, and hence, knowledge of the InversifyJS API is the only requirement to get started.

## Approach
The provided DI subsystem imposes declaring your services and their dependencies declaratively.

This approach is different from the classic one when plugins implement lifecycle stages. That does not abolish the current functionality but only changes how the code is organized.

That change is required to resolve most of the challenges related to circular dependencies. It also follows the Inversion of Control design principle, which should simplify the plugin's code as it encapsulates all the complexity related to the internal Kibana lifecycles.

The Dependency Injection Subsystem is not a replacement for the existing plugin API. All the services exposed using InversifyJS are accessible in the classic plugins, or the other way around. A plugin can use both simultaneously and gradually migrate to the declarative DI API.

## Implementation
The implementation utilizes the [hierarchical dependency injection](https://inversify.io/docs/fundamentals/di-hierarchy/) provided by InversifyJS. Every plugin has its own container inhertied from the root one. That provides sufficient level of isolation with an option to share common services.

```mermaid
graph TD

subgraph Core Scope
Root[Root Context]
end

subgraph Plugin Scope
A[Plugin A]
B[Plugin B]
end

subgraph Request Scope
ForkA[Forked Plugin A]
ForkB[Forked Plugin B]
ForkContext[Forked Context]
end

Root --> A
Root --> B

A --> ForkA
B --> ForkB
Root --> ForkContext
```

There are two limitations in this setup:
1. There is no way to publish services registered in the plugin scope to make them available for other plugins.
2. The request-scoped services bound in the forked context will not be available in a forked plugin scope.

The internal module provided by the core services solves those problems by introducing the `Global` injection token.

The services marked as globally available will be registered in the global scope so that every plugin scope will inherit them. They will be resolved dynamically through the bound context so that the services bound in the request scope can inject request-scope dependencies.

## Usage
### Get Started
To get started, just create an empty plugin and declare a named export called `module` in your `index.ts`:

```ts
import { ContainerModule, inject, injectable } from 'inversify';

@injectable()
export class Greeting {
  greet(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  }
}

export const module = new ContainerModule(({ bind }) => {
  bind(Greeting).toSelf();
});
```

The service should now be available in other container modules.

```ts
import { ContainerModule, inject, injectable } from 'inversify';
import { Greeting } from '@kbn/greeting';

@injectable()
class HelloWorld {
  constructor(@inject(Greeting) private greeting: Greeting) {}

  run() {
    this.greeting.greet('World');
  }
}

export const module = new ContainerModule(({ bind }) => {
  bind(HelloWorld).toSelf();
});
```

### Exposing Contracts
In order to expose services to already existing plugins, they should be returned as part of the contract via the `Setup` or `Start` services.

```ts
import { ContainerModule } from 'inversify';
import { Start } from '@kbn/core-di';
import { HelloWorld } from './src/hello-world';

export const module = new ContainerModule(({ bind }) => {
  bind(HelloWorld).toSelf();
  bind(Start).toResolvedValue(
    (helloWorld) => ({ helloWorld }),
    [HelloWorld]
  );
});
```

Plugins may define both classic and module-based contracts simultaneously.
This is to provide a seamless migration path from the classic approach.
In this case, the contract returned from the classic definition has precedence over the one defined in the container module.


### Lifecycle Hooks
It is possible to subscribe to the lifecycle events and run some initialization logic. This can be done via binding `OnSetup` or `OnStart` callbacks. It is allowed to bind multiple of the same kind.

There is no dedicated teardown hook alike `stop` in the classic plugins.
That's done in favor of the built-in [deactivation](https://inversify.io/docs/fundamentals/lifecycle/deactivation/) lifecycle hook.

When Kibana is stopping all the services within a container a being unbound, and hence, all the registered deactivation hooks are being called.
Note that within the request scope, the deactivation hooks will be called upon scope disposal after the request has been handled.

```ts
import { ContainerModule } from 'inversify';
import { OnSetup, OnStart } from '@kbn/core-di';
import { HelloWorld } from '@kbn/hello-world';
import { download } from './src/chromium',

export const module = new ContainerModule(({ bind }) => {
  bind(OnSetup).toConstantValue(download);
  bind(OnStart).toResolvedValue(
    (helloWorld) => () => console.log(helloWorld.run()),
    [HelloWorld]
  );
});
```

### Existing Plugins
The `PluginSetup` and `PluginStart` injection tokens can be used to inject existing plugins without migrating or adapting them. This is similar to accessing plugin dependencies from the lifecycle methods.

```ts
import { inject, injectable } from 'inversify';
import { PluginSetup } from '@kbn/core-di';
import { EmbeddableSetup } from '@kbn/embeddable-plugin/server';

@injectable()
class SomeService {
  constructor(@inject(PluginSetup('embeddable')) private embeddable: EmbeddableSetup) {}

  run() {
    // this.embeddable...
  }
}
```

### Core Services
The core services can be accessed in a similar manner, but instead, the `CoreSetup` and `CoreStart` tokens from `@kbn/core-di-browser` and `@kbn/core-di-server` should be used.

```ts
import { inject, injectable } from 'inversify';
import { CoreStart } from '@kbn/core-di-browser';
import type { HttpStart } from '@kbn/core-http-browser';

@injectable()
export class Greeting {
  constructor(@inject(CoreStart('http')) private readonly http: HttpStart) {}

  public greet(name: string): Promise<string> {
    return this.http.post<string>('/api/greeting', {
      body: JSON.stringify(name),
    });
  }
}
```

### HTTP Routing
The HTTP routes can be registered declaratively using the `Route` token from `@kbn/core-di-server`.
All the routes should be bound explicitly in the request [scope](https://inversify.io/docs/fundamentals/binding/#scope).

The DI service will register a wrapper that dynamically instantiates the bound route handler.
In this case, an isolated scope is created that should inherit all the plugin's services and global services from other plugins.

The current request and the response factory will be available in the request container via the `Request` and `Response` tokens, respectively.

After handling the request, the request scope is disposed automatically and all the services bound in the request container will be unbound asynchronously.

```ts
import { ContainerModule, inject, injectable } from 'inversify';
import { Request, Response, Route } from '@kbn/core-di-server';
import type { KibanaRequest, KibanaResponseFactory } from '@kbn/core-http-server';
import { Greeting } from '@kbn/greeting';

@injectable()
class GreetingRoute {
  static method = 'post' as const;
  static path = '/api/greeting';
  static validate = {
    // ...
  } as const;
  static options = {
    // ...
  } as const;
  static security = {
    // ...
  } as const;

  constructor(
    @inject(Greeting) private readonly greeting: Greeting,
    @inject(Request) private readonly request: KibanaRequest,
    @inject(Response) private readonly response: KibanaResponseFactory
  ) {}

  handle() {
    const greeting = this.greeting.greet(this.request.body);

    return this.response.ok({
      headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(greeting),
    });
  }
}

export const module = new ContainerModule(({ bind }) => {
  bind(GreetingRoute).toSelf().inRequestScope();
  bind(Route).toConstantValue(GreetingRoute);
});
```

### Browser-Side Applications
The concept is the same as that of HTTP routing.
The `Application` token can register an application mount handler.
And the mount parameters can be accessed using the `ApplicationParameters` token.

```ts
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { ContainerModule, inject, injectable } from 'inversify';
import type { AppMountParameters, AppUnmount } from '@kbn/core-application-browser';
import { Application, ApplicationParameters } from '@kbn/core-di-browser';

@injectable()
class HelloWorldApplication {
  public static id = 'helloWorldApplication';
  public static title = 'Hello World';
  public static visibleIn = [];

  constructor(
    @inject(ApplicationParameters) private readonly params: AppMountParameters
  ) {}

  mount(): AppUnmount {
    const { element } = this.params;
    ReactDOM.render(
      /* ... */,
      element
    );

    return () => ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(element);
  }
}

export const module = new ContainerModule(({ bind }) => {
  bind(HelloWorldApplication).toSelf().inRequestScope();
  bind(Application).toConstantValue(HelloWorldApplication);
});
```

### React
The DI can be used from within a React application.
The `@kbn/core-di-browser` provides hooks `useService` and `useContainer` that can resolve services in React components.

In order to use them, the corresponding context should be provided:
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { inject, injectable } from 'inversify';
import { Context, CoreStart } from '@kbn/core-di-browser';

@injectable()
class HelloWorldApplication {
  // ...

  constructor(
    // ...
    @inject(CoreStart('injection')) private readonly di: CoreDiServiceStart
  ) {}

  mount() {
    ReactDOM.render(
      <Context.Provider value={this.di.getContainer()}>
        <HelloWorldApp />
      </Context.Provider>,
      this.params.element
    );

    // ...
  }
}
```

And then, the `useService` hook can be used directly to resolve all the services available within the plugin's scope:
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useService } from '@kbn/core-di-browser';
import { HelloWorld } from '@kbn/hello-world';

export function HelloWorldApp() {
  const helloWorld = useService(HelloWorld);

  return (
    /* ... */
  );
}
```

### Lazy Loading
Lazy loading can be achieved using the built-in InversifyJS features:
```ts
import { ContainerModule, ServiceIdentifier } from 'inversify';
import type { IHeavyService } from './heavy-service';

export const HeavyServiceToken = Symbol.for('HeavyService') as ServiceIdentifier<IHeavyService>;

export const module = new ContainerModule(({ bind }) => {
  bind(HeavyServiceToken)
    .toResolvedValue(() => import('./heavy-service').HeavyService)
    .inSingletonScope();
});
```

In this case, the services will be resolved asynchronously, and, hence, the destination code should take it into account:
```ts
import { ContainerModule, inject, injectable } from 'inversify';
import { OnSetup } from '@kbn/core-di';
import { HeavyServiceToken, type IHeavyService } from '@kbn/heavy-service';

@injectable()
class SomeService {
  constructor(@inject(HeavyServiceToken) private heavyService: IHeavyService) {}

  run() {
    // this.heavyService...
  }
}

export const module = new ContainerModule(({ bind }) => {
  bind(SomeService).toSelf();
  bind(OnSetup).toConstantValue(async (container) => {
    const someService = await container.getAsync(SomeService);

    someService.run();
  });
});
```

### Circular Dependencies
The DI should help resolve problems with circular dependencies.
Since plugins implemented using the container modules no longer depend on the actual implementation of their dependencies, the services can be injected using static tokens rather than classes:
```ts
import { ContainerModule, type ServiceIdentifier } from 'inversify';
import { SomeService } from './some-service';

export interface ISomeService {
  run(): void;
}

export const SomeServiceToken = Symbol.for('SomeService') as ServiceIdentifier<ISomeService>;

export const module = new ContainerModule(({ bind }) => {
  bind(SomeServiceToken).to(SomeService);
});
```

In this case, if `SomeService` depends on another service from a different plugin, which also has dependencies on `SomeService`, an intermediate package should be created to expose static injection tokens with public interfaces.
In other words, the solution would be to segregate injection tokens from the container module definition.

Another problem is circular dependency between two services.
It is an anti-pattern that highlights a more serious problem that should be resolved instead.
But if there is no other option, then it can be resolved by using the `onActivation` hook:
```ts
import { ContainerModule, inject, injectable, type ServiceIdentifier } from 'inversify';

export interface IGreeting {
  greet(): string;
}

export interface IUser {
  getName(): string;
  greet(): string;
}

@injectable()
class Greeting implements IGreeting {
  constructor(@inject(User) user: User) {}

  public greet(): string {
    return `Hello, ${this.user.getName()}!`;
  }
}

@injectable()
class TestUser implements IUser {
  #greeting!: Greeting;

  set greeting(value: Greeting) {
    this.#greeting = value;
  }

  public greet(): string {
    return this.#greeting.greet();
  }

  public getName(): string {
    return 'Test';
  }
}

export const GreetingToken = Symbol.for('Greeting') as ServiceIdentifier<IGreeting>;
export const UserToken = Symbol.for('User') as ServiceIdentifier<IUser>;

export const module = new ContainerModule(({ bind }) => {
  bind(GreetingToken).to(Greeting);
  bind(UserToken).to(TestUser).onActivation(({ get }, user) => {
    user.greeting = get(GreetingToken);
  });
});
```

In most cases, the underlying problem is either duplicating some functionality or insufficient decomposition.
With the decoupled container module configuration, it should be easier to detect that.
But if there is no other option to get away from the services composition, deferred dependency injection via the `onActivation` hook is an acceptable option since it does not break the Inversion of Control principle.

## Examples
There is an [example](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/main/examples/dependency_injection) plugin covering the complete injection flow.
