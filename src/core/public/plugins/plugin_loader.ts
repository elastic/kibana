 *
 * If this is slowing down browser load time, there are some ways we could make this faster:
 *    - Add these bundles in the generated bootstrap.js file so they're loaded immediately
 *    - Concatenate all the bundles files on the backend and serve them in single request.
 *    - Use HTTP/2 to load these bundles without having to open new connections for each.
 *
 * This may not be much of an issue since these should be cached by the browser after the first
 * page load.
