Make no mistake, it is going to take a lot of work to move certain plugins to the new platform. Our target is to migrate the entire repo over to the new platform throughout 7.x and to remove the legacy plugin system no later than 8.0, and this is only possible if teams start on the effort now.

The goal of this document is to guide teams through the recommended process of migrating at a high level. Every plugin is different, so teams should tweak this plan based on their unique requirements.

We'll start with an overview of how plugins work in the new platform, and we'll end with a generic plan of action that can be applied to any plugin in the repo today.

## Overview

Plugins in the new platform are not especially novel or complicated to describe. Our intention wasn't to build some clever system that magically solved problems through abstractions and layers of obscurity, and we wanted to make sure plugins could continue to use most of the same technologies they use today, at least from a technical perspective.

New platform plugins exist in the `src/plugins` and `x-pack/plugins` directories.

### Architecture

Plugins are defined as classes and exposed to the platform itself through a simple wrapper function. A plugin can have browser side code, server side code, or both. There is no architectural difference between a plugin in the browser and a plugin on the server, which is to say that in both places you describe your plugin similarly, and you interact with core and/or other plugins in the same way.

The basic file structure of a new platform plugin named "demo" that had both client-side and server-side code would be:

```
src/plugins
  demo
    kibana.json [1]
    public
      index.ts [2]
      plugin.ts [3]
    server
      index.ts [4]
      plugin.ts [5]
```

**[1] `kibana.json`** is a static manifest file that is used to identify the plugin and to determine what kind of code the platform should execute from the plugin:

```json
{
  "id": "demo",
  "server": true,
  "ui": true
}
```

Note that `package.json` files are irrelevant to and ignored by the new platform.

**[2] `public/index.ts`** is the entry point into the client-side code of this plugin. It must export a function named `plugin`, which will receive a standard set of core capabilities as an argument (e.g. logger). It should return an instance of its plugin definition for the platform to register at load time.

```ts
import { PluginInitializerContext } from '../../../core/public';
import { Plugin } from './plugin';

export function plugin(initializerContext: PluginInitializerContext) {
  return new Plugin(initializerContext);
}
```

**[3] `public/plugin.ts`** is the client-side plugin definition itself. Technically speaking it does not need to be a class or even a separate file from the entry point, but _all plugins at Elastic_ should be consistent in this way.

```ts
import { PluginInitializerContext, PluginName, PluginStart, PluginStop } from '../../../core/public';

export class Plugin {
  constructor(initializerContext: PluginInitializerContext) {
  }

  public start(core: PluginStart, dependencies: Record<PluginName, unknown>) {
    // called when plugin is started up, aka when Kibana is loaded
  }

  public stop(core: PluginStop, dependencies: Record<PluginName, unknown>) {
    // called when plugin is torn down, aka window.onbeforeunload
  }
}
```

**[4] `server/index.ts`** is the entry-point into the server-side code of this plugin. It is identical in almost every way to the client-side entry-point:

```ts
import { PluginInitializerContext } from '../../../core/server';
import { Plugin } from './plugin';

export function plugin(initializerContext: PluginInitializerContext) {
  return new Plugin(initializerContext);
}
```

**[5] `server/plugin.ts`** is the server-side plugin definition. The _shape_ of this plugin is the same as it's client-side counter-part:

```ts
import { PluginInitializerContext, PluginName, PluginStart, PluginStop } from '../../../core/server';

export class Plugin {
  constructor(initializerContext: PluginInitializerContext) {
  }

  public start(core: PluginStart, dependencies: Record<PluginName, unknown>) {
    // called when plugin is started up during Kibana's startup sequence
  }

  public stop(core: PluginStop, dependencies: Record<PluginName, unknown>) {
    // called when plugin is torn down during Kibana's shutdown sequence
  }
}
```

The platform does not impose any technical restrictions on how the internals of the plugin are architected, though there are certain considerations related to how plugins interact with core and how plugins interact with other plugins that may greatly impact how they are built.
