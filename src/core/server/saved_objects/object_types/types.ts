 * A legacy URL alias is created for an object when it is converted from a single-namespace type to a multi-namespace type. This enables us
 * to preserve functionality of existing URLs for objects whose IDs have been changed during the conversion process, by way of the new
 * `SavedObjectsClient.resolve()` API.
 *
 * Legacy URL aliases are only created by the `DocumentMigrator`, and will always have a saved object ID as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * `${targetNamespace}:${targetType}:${sourceId}`
 * ```
 *
 * This predictable object ID allows aliases to be easily looked up during the resolve operation, and ensures that exactly one alias will
 * exist for a given source per space.
