 * allocate the replicas. When migrations proceed with a yellow index it means
 * we don't have as much data-redundancy as we could have, but waiting for
 * replicas would mean that v2 migrations fail where v1 migrations would have
 * succeeded. It doesn't feel like it's Kibana's job to force users to keep
 * their clusters green and even if it's green when we migrate it can turn
 * yellow at any point in the future. So ultimately data-redundancy is up to
 * users to maintain.
