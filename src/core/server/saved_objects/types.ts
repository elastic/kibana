/**
 * Saved Objects is Kibana's data persisentence mechanism allowing plugins to

 *
 * ## SavedObjectsClient errors
 *
 * Since the SavedObjectsClient has its hands in everything we
 * are a little paranoid about the way we present errors back to
 * to application code. Ideally, all errors will be either:
 *
 *   1. Caused by bad implementation (ie. undefined is not a function) and
 *      as such unpredictable
 *   2. An error that has been classified and decorated appropriately
 *      by the decorators in {@link SavedObjectsErrorHelpers}
 *
 * Type 1 errors are inevitable, but since all expected/handle-able errors
 * should be Type 2 the `isXYZError()` helpers exposed at
 * `SavedObjectsErrorHelpers` should be used to understand and manage error
 * responses from the `SavedObjectsClient`.
 *
 * Type 2 errors are decorated versions of the source error, so if
 * the elasticsearch client threw an error it will be decorated based
 * on its type. That means that rather than looking for `error.body.error.type` or
 * doing substring checks on `error.body.error.reason`, just use the helpers to
 * understand the meaning of the error:
 *
 *   ```js
 *   if (SavedObjectsErrorHelpers.isNotFoundError(error)) {
 *      // handle 404
 *   }
 *
 *   if (SavedObjectsErrorHelpers.isNotAuthorizedError(error)) {
 *      // 401 handling should be automatic, but in case you wanted to know
 *   }
 *
 *   // always rethrow the error unless you handle it
 *   throw error;
 *   ```
 *
 * ### 404s from missing index
 *
 * From the perspective of application code and APIs the SavedObjectsClient is
 * a black box that persists objects. One of the internal details that users have
 * no control over is that we use an elasticsearch index for persistance and that
 * index might be missing.
 *
 * At the time of writing we are in the process of transitioning away from the
 * operating assumption that the SavedObjects index is always available. Part of
 * this transition is handling errors resulting from an index missing. These used
 * to trigger a 500 error in most cases, and in others cause 404s with different
 * error messages.
 *
 * From my (Spencer) perspective, a 404 from the SavedObjectsApi is a 404; The
 * object the request/call was targeting could not be found. This is why #14141
 * takes special care to ensure that 404 errors are generic and don't distinguish
 * between index missing or document missing.
 *
 * ### 503s from missing index
 *
 * Unlike all other methods, create requests are supposed to succeed even when
 * the Kibana index does not exist because it will be automatically created by
 * elasticsearch. When that is not the case it is because Elasticsearch's
 * `action.auto_create_index` setting prevents it from being created automatically
 * so we throw a special 503 with the intention of informing the user that their
 * Elasticsearch settings need to be updated.
 *
 * See {@link SavedObjectsClient}
 * See {@link SavedObjectsErrorHelpers}
