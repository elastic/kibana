/*
 * This provides a mechanism for preventing multiple Kibana instances from
 * simultaneously running migrations on the same index. It synchronizes this
 * by handling index creation conflicts, and putting this instance into a
 * poll loop that periodically checks to see if the index is migrated.
 *
 * The reason we have to coordinate this, rather than letting each Kibana instance
 * perform duplicate work, is that if we allowed each Kibana to simply run migrations in
 * parallel, they would each try to reindex and each try to create the destination index.
 * If those indices already exist, it may be due to contention between multiple Kibana
 * instances (which is safe to ignore), but it may be due to a partially completed migration,
 * or someone tampering with the Kibana alias. In these cases, it's not clear that we should
 * just migrate data into an existing index. Such an action could result in data loss. Instead,
 * we should probably fail, and the Kibana sys-admin should clean things up before relaunching
 * Kibana.
