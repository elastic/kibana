# Reviewing SavedObject PRs

## Automatic test-based review request

PRs modifying / adding / deleting any SO type registration will be identified by the integration
test located at `src/core/server/integration_tests/saved_objects/migrations/check_registered_types.test.ts`.

This test will fail any time a potential migration-impactful change is performed on any SO type registration,
and will force the PR's author to update the test's snapshot, which will trigger a review from the Core team.

## What and how to review?

Reviews will likely be triggered when one, or more, of these scenarios occurs:
- a new type was added
- a type was removed (no longer registered)
- a new migration function was added
- a mapping change was performed
- a new validation schema was added

### A new type was added / 

We have another integration test asserting for this (`src/core/server/integration_tests/saved_objects/migrations/type_registrations.test.ts`)

In case of addition of a new type, there's isn't much to review, except checking if the type is registered as `hidden: true` and encourage to do so otherwise. 

### a type was removed

The same integration test from previous chapter also needs to be updated. 

For this scenario, we need to check that `REMOVED_TYPES` (`packages/core/saved-objects/core-saved-objects-migration-server-internal/src/core/unused_types.ts`)
was properly updated (but, again, the integration test will fail otherwise)

### A new migration function was added

- Review the migration function (owners are supposed to do it, but an additional review doesn't hurt)
- Make sure that the migration function is properly tested by unit tests and, ideally, integration tests backed by real data
- If the migration function is moving/creating/deleting/mutating fields, make sure that the type's mappings were updated accordingly

### A mapping change was performed

- Make sure a migration function was added to reflect the changes.
- If migration function is present, refer to previous section.
- If the type is registering validation schemas, make sure a new schema was added reflecting the changes of model.

### A new validation schema was added

- Make sure the associated mapping changes were performed, and that a migration function was added accordingly.
- Refer to prior sections to see what to check.
