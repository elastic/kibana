/**
 * The Kibana Core APIs for server-side plugins.
 *
 * A plugin's `server/index` file must contain a named import, `plugin`, that
 * implements {@link PluginInitializer} which returns an object that implements
 * {@link Plugin}.
 *
 * The plugin integrates with the core system via lifecycle events: `setup`,
 * `start`, and `stop`. In each lifecycle method, the plugin will receive the
 * corresponding core services available (either {@link CoreSetup} or
 * {@link CoreStart}) and any interfaces returned by dependency plugins'
 * lifecycle method. Anything returned by the plugin's lifecycle method will be
 * exposed to downstream dependencies when their corresponding lifecycle methods
 * are invoked.
