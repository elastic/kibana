## Font usage

Kibana packages two fonts:

* [Inter UI](https://rsms.me/inter/) fonts were pulled from their site and are at v3.2
* [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) was pulled from the Google Fonts website on January 22, 2019.

Licenses for both can be found in the folders below this root.
