/*
 * Initialize a collector for Kibana Ops Stats
 *
 * NOTE this collector's fetch method returns the latest stats from the
 * Hapi/Good/Even-Better ops event listener. Therefore, the stats reset
 * every 5 seconds (the default value of the ops.interval configuration
 * setting). That makes it geared for providing the latest "real-time"
 * stats. In the long-term, fetch should return stats that constantly
 * accumulate over the server's uptime for better machine readability.
 * Since the data is captured, timestamped and stored, the historical
 * data can provide "real-time" stats by calculating a derivative of
 * the metrics.
 * See PR comment in https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/20577/files#r202416647
