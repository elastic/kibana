/**
 *  Create a Transform stream that receives values in object mode,
 *  and intersperses a chunk between each object received.
 *
 *  This is useful for writing lists:
 *
 *    createListStream(['foo', 'bar'])
 *      .pipe(createIntersperseStream('\n'))
 *      .pipe(process.stdout) // outputs "foo\nbar"
 *
 *  Combine with a concat stream to get "join" like functionality:
 *
 *    await createPromiseFromStreams([
 *      createListStream(['foo', 'bar']),
 *      createIntersperseStream(' '),
 *      createConcatStream()
 *    ]) // produces a single value "foo bar"
 *
 *  @param  {String|Buffer} intersperseChunk
 *  @return {Transform}
