/**

 * That way the actual (MarkdownVisComponent) will properly trigger it's prop update
 * callback (componentWillReceiveProps) if one of these params change. It wouldn't
 * trigger otherwise (e.g. it doesn't for this wrapper), since it only triggers
 * if the reference to the prop changes (in this case the reference to vis).
 *
 * The way React works, this wrapper nearly brings no overhead, but allows us
 * to use proper lifecycle methods in the actual component.
