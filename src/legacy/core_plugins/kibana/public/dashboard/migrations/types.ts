// Note that these types are prefixed with `Raw` because there are some post processing steps
// that happen before the saved objects even reach the client. Namely, injecting type and id
// parameters back into the panels, where the raw saved objects actually have them stored elsewhere.
//
// Ideally, everywhere in the dashboard code would use references at the top level instead of
// embedded in the panels. The reason this is stored at the top level is so the references can be uniformly
// updated across all saved object types that have references.

// Starting in 7.3 we introduced the possibility of embeddables existing without an id
// parameter.  If there was no id, then type remains on the panel.  So it either will have a name,
// or a type property.

// All of these types can actually exist in 7.2!  The names are pretty confusing because we did

// created in 6.0 will look like after it's been migrated up to 7.2, *not* what it would look like in 6.0.
// That's why it actually doesn't have id or type, but has a name property, because that was a migration
// added in 7.0.

// Hopefully since we finally have a formal saved object migration system and we can do less in place
// migrations, this will be easier to understand moving forward.

// Starting in 6.4 we added an in-place edit on panels to remove columns and sort properties and put them
// inside the embeddable config (https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/17446).
// Note that this was not added as a saved object migration until 7.3, so there can still exist panels in
