/**
 * New Platform Shim
 *
 * In this file, we import any legacy dependencies we have, and shim them into
 * our plugin by manually constructing the values that the new platform will
 * eventually be passing to the `setup/start` method of our plugin definition.
 *
 * The idea is that our `plugin.ts` can stay "pure" and not contain any legacy
 * world code. Then when it comes time to migrate to the new platform, we can
 * simply delete this shim file.
 *
 * We are also calling `setup/start` here and exporting our public contract so that
 * other legacy plugins are able to import from '../core_plugins/visualizations/legacy'
 * and receive the response value of the `setup/start` contract, mimicking the
 * data that will eventually be injected by the new platform.
