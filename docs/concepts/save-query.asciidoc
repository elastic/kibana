=== Save a query

Have you ever built a query that you wanted to reuse?
With saved queries, you can save your query text, filters, and time range for reuse anywhere a query bar is present.

For example, suppose you're in *Discover*, and you've put a lot of thought into building
a query that includes query input text, multiple filters, and a specific time range.
Save this query, and you can reuse it in dashboards and visualizations, and share it in
a link.

Saved queries are different than <<save-open-search,saved searches>>, which save a specific configuration in *Discover*.
Saved searches are primarily used for adding search results to a dashboard,
although they can also serve as the foundation for building visualizations.

==== Save a query

. In the popover, click *Save current query*.

. Click *Save*.
. To load a saved query, select it in the *Saved query* popover.

The query text, filters, and time range are updated and your data refreshed.
If you’re loading a saved query that did not include the filters or time range, those components remain as-is.
. To clear, modify, and delete saved queries, use the *Saved query* popover.
