== Save a query
A saved query is a collection of query text and filters that you can
reuse in <<discover, Discover>> and <<dashboard, Dashboard>>. Save a query when you want to:

* Retrieve results from the same query at a later time without having to reenter the query text, add the filters or set the time filter
* View the results of the same query in multiple apps
* Share your query

Saved queries don't include information specific to *Discover*,
such as the currently selected columns in the document table, the sort order, and the index pattern.
To save your current view of *Discover* for later retrieval and reuse,
create a <<save-open-search, saved search>> instead.

NOTE::

If you have insufficient privileges to save queries, the *Save current query*
button isn't visible in the saved query management popover.
For more information, see <<xpack-security-authorization, Granting access to Kibana>>

. Click *#* in the query bar.
. In the popover, click *Save current query*.

* Delete.  You can’t recover a deleted query.
