=== Save a query

Have you ever built a query that you wanted to reuse?
With saved queries, you can save your query text, filters, and time range for
reuse anywhere a query bar is present.

For example, suppose you're in *Discover*, and you've put time into building
a query that includes query input text, multiple filters, and a specific time range.
Save this query, and you can embed the search results in dashboards,
use them as a foundation for building a visualization,
and share them in a link or CVS form.

Saved queries are different than <<save-open-search,saved searches>>,
which include the *Discover* configuration&mdash;selected columns in the document table, sort order, and
index pattern&mdash;in addition to the query.
Saved searches are primarily used for adding search results to a dashboard.
