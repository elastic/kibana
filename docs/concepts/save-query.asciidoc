=== Save a query
A saved query is a portable collection of query text and filters that you can reuse in
<<discover, Discover>> and <<dashboard, Dashboard>>. Save a query when you want to:

* Retrieve results from the same query at a later time without having to reenter the query text,
add the filters, or set the time filter.
* View the results of the same query in multiple apps.
* Share your query.

Saved queries don't include information specific to *Discover*,
such as the currently selected columns in the document table,
the sort order, and the index pattern. To save your current view of
*Discover* for later retrieval and reuse, create a <<save-open-search, saved search>> instead.
