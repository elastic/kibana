The Elasticsearch Query Language, {esql}, makes it faster and easier to explore your data.

{esql} is a piped language which allows you to chain together multiple commands to query your data.
Based on the query, Lens suggestions in Discover create a visualization of the query results.

{esql} comes with its own dedicated {esql} Compute Engine for greater efficiency. With one query you can search, aggregate, calculate and perform data transformations without leaving **Discover**. Write your query directly in **Discover** or use the **Dev Tools** with the {ref}/esql-rest.html[{esql} API].

Here's how to use {esql} in the data view selector in **Discover**:

{esql} also features in-app help, so you can get started faster and don't have to leave the application to check syntax.

You can also use ES|QL queries to create panels on your dashboards, create enrich policies, and create alerting rules.

For more detailed information about {esql} in Kibana, refer to {ref}/esql-kibana.html[Using {esql} in {kib}].

[NOTE]
====
{esql} is enabled by default in {kib}. It can be
disabled using the `enableESQL` setting from the
{kibana-ref}/advanced-options.html[Advanced Settings].

This will hide the {esql} user interface from various applications.
However, users will be able to access existing {esql} artifacts like saved searches and visualizations.

{esql} makes it much easier to analyze metrics, logs and traces from a single query. Find performance issues fast by defining fields on the fly, enriching data with lookups, and using simultaneous query processing. Combining {esql} with {ml} and AiOps can improve detection accuracy and use aggregated value thresholds.

[[esql-security]]
==== Security 

Use {esql} to retrieve important information for investigation by using lookups. Enrich data and create new fields on the go to gain valuable insight for faster decision-making and actions. For example, perform a lookup on an IP address to identify its geographical location, its association with known malicious entities, or whether it belongs to a known cloud service provider all from one search bar. {esql} ensures more accurate alerts by incorporating aggregated values in detection rules.

==== What's next?

The main documentation for {esql} lives in the {ref}/esql.html[{es} docs].

We also have a short tutorial in the **Discover** docs: <<try-esql,Using {esql}>>.
