[[data-views]]
=== Create a data view

{kib} requires a data view to access the {es} data that you want to explore.
A data view selects the data to use and allows you to define properties of the fields.

A data view can point to one or more indices, {ref}/data-streams.html[data stream], or {ref}/alias.html[index aliases].
For example, a data view can point to your log data from yesterday,
or all indices that contain your data.

[[data-views-read-only-access]]
=== Required permissions

* Access to *Data Views* requires the <<kibana-role-management, {kib} privilege>>
`Data View Management`.

* To create a data view, you must have the <<kibana-role-management,{es} privilege>>
`view_index_metadata`.

* If a read-only indicator appears in {kib}, you have insufficient privileges
to create or save data views. The buttons to create new data views or
save existing data views are not visible. For more information,
refer to <<xpack-security-authorization,Granting access to {kib}>>.

[[settings-create-pattern]]
=== Create a data view

If you collected data using one of the {kib} <<connect-to-elasticsearch,ingest options>>,
uploaded a file, or added sample data,
you get a data view for free, and can start exploring your data.
If you loaded your own data, follow these steps to create a data view.

. Open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Data Views*.

. Click *Create data view*.

. Start typing in the *name* field, and {kib} looks for the names of
indices, data streams, and aliases that match your input.

+
** To match multiple sources, use a wildcard (*). For example, `filebeat-*` matches
`filebeat-apache-a`, `filebeat-apache-b`, and so on.
+
** To match multiple single sources, enter their names,
separated with a comma.  Do not include a space after the comma.
`filebeat-a,filebeat-b` matches two indices, but not match `filebeat-c`.
+
** To exclude a source, use a minus sign (-), for example, `-test3`.

. If {kib} detects an index with a timestamp, expand the *Timestamp field* menu,
and then select the default field for filtering your data by time.
+
** If your index doesn’t have time-based data, choose *I don’t want to use the time filter*.
+
** If you don’t set a default time field, you can't use
global time filters on your dashboards. This is useful if
you have multiple time fields and want to create dashboards that combine visualizations
based on different timestamps.

. Click *Create data view*.
+
[[reload-fields]] {kib} is now configured to use your {es} data. When a new field is added to an index,
the data view field list is updated
the next time the data view is loaded, for example, when you load the page or
move between {kib} apps.

. Select this data view when you search and visualize your data.

[[rollup-data-view]]
==== Create a data view for rolled up data

A data view can match one rollup index.  For a combination rollup
data view with both raw and rolled up data, use the standard notation:

```ts
rollup_logstash,kibana_sample_data_logs
```
For an example, refer to <<rollup-data-tutorial,Create and visualize rolled up data>>.

[[management-cross-cluster-search]]
==== Create a data view that searches across clusters

If your {es} clusters are configured for {ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[{ccs}],
you can create a {data-source} to search across the clusters of your choosing.
You specify data streams, indices, and aliases in a remote cluster using the
following syntax:

```ts
<remote_cluster_name>:<target>
```

To query {ls} indices across two {es} clusters
that you set up for {ccs}, named `cluster_one` and `cluster_two`:

```ts
 cluster_one:logstash-*,cluster_two:logstash-*
```

Use wildcards in your cluster names
to match any number of clusters. To search {ls} indices across
clusters named `cluster_foo`, `cluster_bar`, and so on:

```ts
cluster_*:logstash-*
```

To query across all {es} clusters that have been configured for {ccs},
use a standalone wildcard for your cluster name:

```ts
*:logstash-*
```

To match indices starting with `logstash-`, but exclude those starting with `logstash-old`, from
all clusters having a name starting with `cluster_`:

```ts
`cluster_*:logstash-*,cluster_*:-logstash-old*`
```

To exclude a cluster having a name starting with `cluster_`:

```ts
`cluster_*:logstash-*,cluster_one:-*`
```

Once you configure a data view to use the {ccs} syntax, all searches and
aggregations using that data view in {kib} take advantage of {ccs}.

[float]
[[delete-data-view]]
=== Delete data views

When you delete a data view, you cannot recover the associated field formatters, runtime fields, source filters,
and field popularity data. Deleting a data view does not remove any indices or data documents from {es}.

WARNING: Deleting a data view breaks all visualizations, saved searches, and other saved objects that reference the data view.

. Open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Data Views*.

. Click the data view to delete.

. Delete (image:management/index-patterns/images/delete.png[Delete icon]) the data view.
