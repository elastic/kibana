== Set the time range

The <<set-time-filter, global time filter>> limits the time range of data displayed.
In most cases, the time filter applies to the time field in the index pattern,
but some apps allow you to use a different time field.

. Click image:concepts/images/time-filter-icon.png[clock icon].

. Choose one of the following:

* *Quick select* to use a recent time range, then use the back and forward
  arrows to move through the time ranges.

* *Commonly used* to use a time range from options such as *Last 15 minutes*,
  *Today*, and *Week to date*.

* *Recently used date ranges* to use a previously selected data range.

* *Refresh every* to specify an automatic refresh rate.

Using the time filter, you can configure a refresh rate to periodically
resubmit your searches. You can also click *Refresh* to resubmit the search.
This might be useful if you use {kib} to monitor the underlying data.
