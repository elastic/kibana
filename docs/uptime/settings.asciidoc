=== Indices

The Uptime settings page lets you change which Heartbeat indices are displayed
by the uptime app. Users must have the 'all' permission to modify items on this page.
Uptime settings apply to the current space only. Use different settings in different
spaces to segment different uptime use cases and domains.

As an example, imagine your organization has one team for internal IT services, and another
for public services. Each team operates independently and is only responsible for its
own services. In this scenario, you might set up separate Heartbeat instances for each team,
writing out to index patterns named `it-heartbeat-\*`, and `external-heartbeat-\*`. You would
create separate roles and users for each in Elasticsearch, each with access to their own spaces,
named `it` and `external` respectively. Within each space you would navigate to the settings page
and set the correct index pattern to match only the indices that space is allowed to access. 

Note that the pattern set here only restricts what the Uptime app shows. Users may still be able
to manually query Elasticsearch for data outside this pattern!

See the <<uptime-security,Uptime Elasticsearch Security>>
and {heartbeat-ref}/securing-heartbeat.html[Heartbeat security]
docs for more information.

=== Certificate thresholds

The settings page also allows you to specify thresholds for all the TLS certificates monitored
in your environment. There is a field for maximum age, and the minimum number of days before
expiration before Uptime should consider a monitor to be in warning state.

For example, you may want to make sure that none of your organization's TLS certificates have been
valid for longer than one year. This is becoming a common security requirement. Modifying the `Age limit`
field's value to 365 days will help you keep track of which certificates you may want to refresh.

Likewise, if you want to see which of your TLS certificates are close to expiring ahead of time, specify
an `Expiration threshold` on this page. When the count of a certificate's remaining valid days falls
below this threshold, Uptime will consider it in a warning state.

The thresholds specified on this page affect how your certificates are visualized on the Certificates page,
and which certificates Uptime will warn about when running a TLS alert.
