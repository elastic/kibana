== Monitor

The Monitor page will help you get further insight into the performance
of a specific network endpoint. You'll see a detailed visualization of
the monitor's request duration over time, as well as the `up`/`down`
status over time. You can also also detect anomalies in response time data
by configuring Machine Learning jobs on this page.

=== Status panel

The Status panel displays a quick summary of the latest information
regarding your monitor. You can view its latest status, click a link to
visit the targeted URL, see its most recent request duration, and determine the
amount of time that has elapsed since the last check.

When two Heartbeat instances are configured in different geographic locations
the map will show each location as a pinpoint on the map, along with the
amount of time elapsed since data was last received from that location.

=== Monitor charts

The Monitor charts visualize information over the time specified in the
date range. These charts can help you gain insight into how quickly requests are being resolved
by the targeted endpoint, and give you a sense of how frequently a host or endpoint
was down in your selected timespan.

The Monitor duration chart displays request duration information for your monitor.
The area surrounding the line is the range of request time for the corresponding
bucket. The line is the average time. Anomaly detection using Machine Learning
can be configured in the upper right hand of this panel. When response times change
in an unexpected way the time range in which they occurred will be given filled with a color.

The pings over time chart is a graphical representation of the check statuses over time. 
Hover over the charts to display crosshairs with more specific numeric data.

=== Check history

The Check history displays the total count of this monitor's checks for the selected
date range. You can additionally filter the checks by status and location to help find recent problems
on a per-check basis. This table can help you gain some insight into more granular details
about recent individual data points Heartbeat is logging about your host or endpoint.
