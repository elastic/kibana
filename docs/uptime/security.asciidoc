== Use with Elasticsearch Security

If you use Elasticsearch security, you'll need to enable certain privileges for users 
that would like to access the Uptime app. Below is an example of creating 
a user and support role to implement those privileges.

=== Create a role

You'll need a role that lets you access the Heartbeat indices, which by default are `heartbeat-*`.
You can create this with the following request:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
---------------------------------------------------------------
PUT /_security/role/uptime
{ "indices" : [
    {
      "names" : [
        "heartbeat-*"
      ],
      "privileges" : [
        "read",
        "view_index_metadata"
      ],
      "field_security" : {
        "grant" : [
          "*"
        ]
      },
      "allow_restricted_indices" : false
    }
  ],
  "applications" : [
    {
      "application" : "kibana-.kibana",
      "privileges" : [
        "all"
      ],
      "resources" : [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "transient_metadata" : {
    "enabled" : true
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

=== Assign the role to a user

Next, you'll need to create a user with both the `kibana_user`, and `uptime` roles. 
You can do this with the following request:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
---------------------------------------------------------------
PUT /_security/user/jacknich
{
  "password" : "j@rV1s",
  "roles" : [ "uptime", "kibana_user" ],
  "full_name" : "Jack Nicholson",
  "email" : "jacknich@example.com",
  "metadata" : {
    "intelligence" : 7
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
