== Use with Elasticsearch Security

If you have Elasticsearch security enabled you'll need to enable certain privileges for users 
that would like to access the Uptime app. In this document we'll show an example of creating 
a user and support role to implement those privileges.

=== Creating the Role

You'll need a role that lets you access the Heartbeat indices, which by default are `heartbeat-*`.
You can create this with the following request:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
---------------------------------------------------------------
PUT /_security/role/uptime
{ "indices" : [
    {
      "names" : [
        "heartbeat-*"
      ],
      "privileges" : [
        "read",
        "view_index_metadata"
      ],
      "field_security" : {
        "grant" : [
          "*"
        ]
      },
      "allow_restricted_indices" : false
    }
  ],
  "applications" : [
    {
      "application" : "kibana-.kibana",
      "privileges" : [
        "all"
      ],
      "resources" : [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "transient_metadata" : {
    "enabled" : true
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

=== Creating the User

You will then need to create a user with both the `kibana_user`, and `uptime` roles. 
You can do this with the following request.

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
---------------------------------------------------------------
PUT /_security/user/jacknich
{
  "password" : "j@rV1s",
  "roles" : [ "uptime", "kibana_user" ],
  "full_name" : "Jack Nicholson",
  "email" : "jacknich@example.com",
  "metadata" : {
    "intelligence" : 7
  }
}
