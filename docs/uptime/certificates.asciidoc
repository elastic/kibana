Uptime has a certificates page, which will visualize all of the TLS certificates Heartbeat
is monitoring in your indices. In addition to the common name, associated monitors, issuer
information, and SHA fingerprints, Uptime will also assign a status based on the values stored
in the <<uptime-settings, Settings page>>.

Several of the columns on this page are sortable, and the search bar at the top of the view
allows you to search on most of the TLS-related fields in your Uptime indices. Additionally, the `Alerts` dropdown at the top of the page will allow you to define a TLS alert.
