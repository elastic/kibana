image::uptime/images/certificates-page.png[Certificates]

The certificates page allows you to visualize TLS certificate data in your indices. In addition to the
common name, associated monitors, issuer information, and SHA fingerprints, Uptime also assigns a status
derived from the threshold values in the <<uptime-settings, Settings page>>.

Several of the columns on this page are sortable. You can use the search bar at the top of the view
to find values in most of the TLS-related fields in your Uptime indices. Additionally, you can
create a TLS alert using the `Alerts` dropdown at the top of the page.
