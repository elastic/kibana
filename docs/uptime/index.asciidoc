Use the Uptime UI to monitor the status of network endpoints via HTTP/S, TCP,
and ICMP. You will be able to explore status over time, drill into specific monitors,
and view a high-level snapshot of your environment at a selected point in time.

== Add monitors
You define your monitors in Heartbeat's configuration file. Refer to the Heartbeat
documentation for instructions on configuring monitors to begin storing Uptime information
in your cluster.

== Begin using Uptime
It is important that you use the corresponding versions of Heartbeat and Kibana. Kibana
supports the equivalent version of Heartbeat, meaning version 6.7 of Kibana will expect
an index of `heartbeat-6*`, while Kibana 7.0 requires `heartbeat-7*` containing documents
from Heartbeat 7.0.
