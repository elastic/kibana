Uptime allows you to monitor the status of network endpoints via HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP.
You can explore endpoint status over time, drill down into specific monitors,
and easily view a high-level snapshot of your environment at any point in time.

To get started with Elastic Uptime, refer to {uptime-guide}/install-uptime.html[Install Uptime].
