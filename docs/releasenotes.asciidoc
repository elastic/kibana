== Kibana 4.4 Release Notes

The 4.4 release of Kibana requires Elasticsearch 2.2 or later.

Using event times to create index names is no longer supported as of this release. Current versions of Elasticsearch
include sophisticated date parsing APIs that Kibana uses to determine date information, removing the need to specify dates
in the index pattern name.
