== Configuring Reporting

NOTE: If you use a reverse-proxy (NGINX, Apache, etc.) to access Kibana, you need
to configure the <<reporting-kibana-server-settings, Kibana server settings>>

By default, a new encryption key is generated for {reporting} each time
you start Kibana. This means any pending reports will fail if you
restart Kibana.

To set a static encryption key for reporting, set the
`xpack.reporting.encryptionKey` property in the `kibana.yml`
configuration file. You can use any text string as the encryption key.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.reporting.encryptionKey: "something_secret"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If you are load balancing across multiple Kibana instances, they need
to have the same reporting encryption key. Otherwise, report generation
will fail if a report is requested through one instance and another instance
picks up the job from the report queue.

You can also configure settings in `kibana.yml` to control how {reporting}
communicates with the Kibana server, manages background jobs, and captures
screenshots. See <<reporting-settings-kb, Reporting Settings>> for the complete
list of settings.
