{xpack} enables you to generate reports that contain {kib} dashboards,
visualizations, and saved searches. Dashboards and visualizations are
exported as PDF documents, while saved searches in Discover
are exported to CSV.

NOTE: On Linux, the `libfontconfig` and `libfreetype6` packages and system
fonts are required to generate PDF reports. If no system fonts are available,
labels are not rendered correctly in the reports.

The following Reporting button is found in the {kib} toolbar:

To use {reporting} in a production environment, <<securing-reporting, secure
the Reporting endpoints>>.
