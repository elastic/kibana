[IMPORTANT]
===================
The interval between report requests must be longer than the time it
takes to generate the reports--otherwise, the report queue can back up. To 
avoid this, increase the time between report requests. 

By default, report generation times out if the report cannot be generated
within 30 seconds. If you are generating reports that contain complex
visualizations or your machine is slow or under constant heavy load, it
might take longer than 30 seconds to generate a report. You can increase
the timeout by setting `xpack.reporting.queue.timeout` in `kibana.yml`.
