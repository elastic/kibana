== Reporting Integration
Integrating a Kibana application with {reporting} requires a minimum amount of code, and the goal is to not have to
modify the Reporting code as we add additional applications. Instead, applications abide by a contract that Reporting
uses to determine the information that is required to export CSVs and PDFs.

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
These pages document internal APIs and are not guaranteed to be supported across future versions of Kibana.
However, these docs will be kept up-to-date to reflect the current implementation of Reporting integration in Kibana.

=== Share Menu Extensions
X-Pack uses the `ShareContextMenuExtensionsRegistryProvider` to register actions in the share menu.

This integration will likely be changing in the near future as we move towards a unified actions abstraction across {kib}.

=== Generate Job URL
To generate a new {reporting} job, different export types require different `jobParams` that are Rison encoded into a URL
that abide by the following convention: `/api/reporting/generate?jobParams=${rison.encode(jobParams)}`. If you use the
aforementioned <<reporting-nav-bar-extensions, nav bar extensions>> then this detail will be abstracted away, but if you
provide a custom UI for generating the report, you will have to generate the URL and create a POST request to the URL.
