=== System Setup

{reporting} is automatically enabled in {kib}. The first time Kibana runs, it downloads binary files for the Chromium web browser, which
runs in a "headless" mode to render the Kibana charts.

Chromium is an open-source project not related to Elastic, but the Chromium binary for Kibana was custom-built by Elastic to ensure it works
with minimal setup. However, there still may be additional dependencies needed on your OS for it to run. See the
<<reporting-troubleshooting-system-dependencies, Reporting Troubleshooting>> section for more information about the system dependencies for
different operating systems.

=== To manually generate a report:

. Open {kib} in your web browser and log in. If you are running {kib}
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601`. To access {kib} and generate
reports, you need the `kibana_user` and `reporting_user` roles. For more
information, see <<secure-reporting>>.

. Open the dashboard, visualization, or saved search you want to include
in the report.

. Click *Share* in the {kib} toolbar:

.. If you're on Discover:
  ... Select *CSV Reports*

  ... Click the *Generate CSV* button.

.. If you're on Visualize or Dashboard:
  ... Select *PDF Reports*

  ... Dashboard only: Choose to enable *Optimize for printing* layout mode. For an explanation of the different layout modes, see <<pdf-layout-modes, PDF Layout Modes>>.

  ... Click the *Generate PDF* button.

If you want to automatically generate reports from a script or with
{watcher}, use the displayed Generation URL. For more information, see
<<automating-report-generation, Automating Report Generation>>
