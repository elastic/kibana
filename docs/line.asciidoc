=== Line Charts

This chart's Y axis is the _metrics_ axis. The following aggregations are available for this axis:

include::y-axis-aggs.asciidoc[]

Before you choose a buckets aggregation, specify if you are splitting slices within a single chart or splitting into
multiple charts. A multiple chart split must run before any other aggregations. When you split a chart, you can change 
if the splits are displayed in a row or a column by clicking the *Rows | Columns* selector.

include::color-picker.asciidoc[]

You can click the *Advanced* link to display more customization options for your metrics or bucket aggregation:

*Exclude Pattern*:: Specify a pattern in this field to exclude from the results.
*Exclude Pattern Flags*:: A standard set of Java flags for the exclusion pattern.
*Include Pattern*:: Specify a pattern in this field to include in the results.
*Include Pattern Flags*:: A standard set of Java flags for the inclusion pattern.
*JSON Input*:: A text field where you can add specific JSON-formatted properties to merge with the aggregation 
definition, as in the following example:

[source,shell]
{ "script" : "doc['grade'].value * 1.2" }

NOTE: In Elasticsearch releases 1.4.3 and later, this functionality requires you to enable 
{ref}/modules-scripting.html[dynamic Groovy scripting].

The availability of these options varies depending on the aggregation you choose.

Select the *Options* tab to change the following aspects of the chart:

*Y-Axis Scale*:: You can select *linear*, *log*, or *square root* scales for the chart's Y axis. You can use a log 
scale to display data that varies exponentially, such as a compounding interest chart, or a square root scale to 
regularize the display of data sets with variabilities that are themselves highly variable. This kind of data, where 
the variability is itself variable over the domain being examined, is known as _heteroscedastic_ data. For example, if 
a data set of height versus weight has a relatively narrow range of variability at the short end of height, but a wider
range at the taller end, the data set is heteroscedastic. 
*Smooth Lines*:: Check this box to curve the line from point to point. Bear in mind that smoothed lines necessarily 
affect the representation of your data and create a potential for ambiguity.
*Show Connecting Lines*:: Check this box to draw lines between the points on the chart.
*Show Circles*:: Check this box to draw each data point on the chart as a small circle.
*Current time marker*:: For charts of time-series data, check this box to draw a red line on the current time.
*Set Y-Axis Extents*:: Check this box and enter values in the *y-max* and *y-min* fields to set the Y axis to specific 
values. 
*Show Tooltip*:: Check this box to enable the display of tooltips.
*Scale Y-Axis to Data Bounds*:: The default Y-axis bounds are zero and the maximum value returned in the data. Check 
this box to change both upper and lower bounds to match the values returned in the data.

After changing options, click the  *Apply changes* button to update your visualization, or the grey *Discard 
changes* button to keep your visualization in its current state.
