For *{ess-trial}[Free Trial]*

Machine Learning functionality is available throughout Elastic Security. You can
view the details of detected anomalies in the `Anomalies` table
shown on the Hosts, Network and associated details pages. You can drag and drop
anomaly details to Timeline, such as the `Entity` itself, or any of the
associated `Influencers`.
