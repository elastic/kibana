== Using the SIEM UI

The SIEM app is a highly interactive workspace for security analysts. It is
designed to be discoverable, clickable, draggable and droppable, expandable and
collapsible, resizable, moveable, and so forth. You start with an overview. Then
you can use the interactive UI to drill down into areas of interest.

[[hosts-ui]]
=== Hosts

The Hosts view provides key metrics regarding host-related security events, and
data tables and widgets that let you interact with the Timeline Event Viewer.
You can drill down for deeper insights, and drag and drop items of interest from
the Hosts view tables to Timeline for further investigation.

[[network-ui]]
=== Network

The Network view provides key network activity metrics, facilitates
investigation time enrichment, and provides network event tables that enable
interaction with the Timeline. You can drill down for deeper insights, and drag
and drop items of interest from the Network view to Timeline for further
investigation.

[[detections-ui]]
=== Detections (beta)

The Detections feature automatically searches for threats and creates 
signals when they are detected. Signal detection rules define the conditions 
for creating signals. The SIEM app comes with prebuilt rules that search for 
suspicious activity on your network and hosts. Additionally, you can
create your own rules.

See {siem-guide}/detection-engine-overview.html[Detections] in the SIEM 
Guide for information on managing detection rules and signals via the UI 
or the Detections API.

[[cases-ui]]
=== Cases (beta)

Cases are used to open and track security issues directly in SIEM. 
Cases list the original reporter and all users who contribute to a case
(`participants`). Case comments support Markdown syntax, and allow linking to
saved Timelines. Additionally, you can send cases to external systems from
within SIEM (currently ServiceNow).

For information about opening, updating, and closing cases, see
{siem-guide}/cases-overview.html[Cases] in the SIEM Guide.

[[timelines-ui]]
=== Timeline

Timeline is your workspace for threat hunting and alert investigations.

You can drag objects of interest into the Timeline Event Viewer to create
exactly the query filter you need. You can drag items from table widgets within
Hosts and Network pages, or even from within Timeline itself.

A timeline is responsive and persists as you move through the SIEM app
collecting data. 

See the {siem-guide}[SIEM Guide] for more details on data sources and an
overview of UI elements and capabilities.

[[sample-workflow]]
=== Sample workflow

An analyst notices a suspicious user ID that warrants further investigation, and
clicks a url that links to the SIEM app. 

The analyst uses the tables, widgets, and filtering and search capabilities in
the SIEM app to get to the bottom of the alert. The analyst can drag items of
interest to the timeline for further analysis.

Within the timeline, the analyst can investigate further--drilling down,
searching, and filtering--and add notes and pin items of interest. 

The analyst can name the timeline, write summary notes, and share it with others
if appropriate.
