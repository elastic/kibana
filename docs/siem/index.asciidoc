The SIEM app in Kibana provides an interactive workspace for security teams to
triage events and perform initial investigations. It enables analysis of
host-related and network-related security events as part of alert investigations
or interactive threat hunting.

== Add data

Kibana provides step-by-step instructions to help you add data. The
{siem-guide}[SIEM Guide] is a good source for more
detailed information and instructions.

https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat[{filebeat}],
https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/winlogbeat[{winlogbeat}], and
https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/packetbeat[{packetbeat}]
send security events and other data to Elasticsearch.

The default index patterns for SIEM events are `auditbeat-*`, `winlogbeat-*`,
`filebeat-*`, and `packetbeat-*``. You can change the default index patterns in
*Kibana > Management > Advanced Settings > siem:defaultIndex*.

=== Elastic Common Schema (ECS) for normalizing data

The {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)] defines a common set of fields to be
used for storing event data in Elasticsearch. ECS helps users normalize their
event data to better analyze, visualize, and correlate the data represented in
their events.

SIEM can ingest and normalize events from ECS-compatible data sources.
