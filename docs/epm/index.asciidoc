== Elastic Package Manager

These are the docs for the Elastic Package Manager (EPM).


=== Configuration

The Elastic Package Manager by default access `epr.elastic.co` to retrieve the package. The url can be configured with:

```
xpack.epm.registryUrl: 'http://localhost:8080'
```

=== API

The Package Manager offers an API. The two simplest API endpoints are install and delete.
Here an example on how they can be used:

Install a package:

```
curl --user elastic:changeme localhost:5601/api/epm/install/iptables-1.0.4
curl --user elastic:changeme localhost:5601/api/epm/install/coredns-1.0.1
```

Delete a package:

```
curl --user elastic:changeme localhost:5601/api/epm/delete/iptables-1.0.4
curl --user elastic:changeme localhost:5601/api/epm/delete/coredns-1.0.1
```
