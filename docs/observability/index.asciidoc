= Observability

Observability enables you to add and monitor your logs, system
metrics, uptime data, and application traces, as a single stack. 

With *Observability*, you have:

* A central place to add and configure your data sources.
* A variety of charts displaying analytics relating to each data source.
* *View in app* options to drill down and analyze data in the Logs, Metrics, Uptime, and APM apps.
* An alerts chart to keep you informed of any issues that you may need to resolve quickly.

{kib} provides step-by-step instructions to help you add and configure your data
sources. The {observability-guide}/index.html[Observability Guide] is a good source for more detailed information
and instructions.

[[logs-app]]
== Logs

The {logs-app} in {kib} enables you to search, filter, and tail all your logs
ingested into {es}. Instead of having to log into different servers, change
directories, and tail individual files, all your logs are available in the {logs-app}.

There is live streaming of logs, filtering using auto-complete, and a logs histogram
for quick navigation. You can also use machine learning to detect specific log
anomalies automatically and categorize log messages to quickly identify patterns in your
log events.

To get started with the {logs-app}, see {observability-guide}/ingest-logs.html[Ingest logs].

[[metrics-app]]
== Metrics

The {metrics-app} in {kib} enables you to visualize infrastructure metrics
to help diagnose problematic spikes, identify high resource utilization,
automatically discover and track pods, and unify your metrics 
with logs and APM data in {es}. 

To get started with the {metrics-app}, see {observability-guide}/ingest-metrics.html[Ingest metrics].

[[uptime-app]]
== Uptime

The {uptime-app} in {kib} enables you to monitor the availability and response times
of applications and services in real time, and detect problems before they affect users.
You can monitor the status of network endpoints via HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP, explore
endpoint status over time, drill down into specific monitors, and view a high-level
snapshot of your environment at any point in time.

To get started with the {uptime-app}, see {observability-guide}/ingest-uptime.html[Ingest uptime data].

[[apm-app]]
== APM

The APM app in {kib} enables you to monitors software services and applications in real time,
collect unhandled errors and exceptions, and automatically pick up basic host-level metrics
and agent specific metrics.

To get started with the APM app, see <<apm-ui,Set up the APM app>>.
