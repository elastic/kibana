= {fleet}

{fleet} in {kib} enables you to manage {elastic-agent} installations in
standalone or {fleet} mode.

Standalone mode requires you to manually configure and manage the agent locally.
It is recommended for advanced users only.

{fleet} mode offers several advantages:

* A central place to configure and monitor your {agent}s.
* Ability to trigger {agent} binary and policy upgrades remotely.
* An overview of the data ingest in your {es} cluster.
