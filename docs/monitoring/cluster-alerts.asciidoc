=== Cluster Alerts

The *Monitoring > Clusters* page in {kib} summarizes the status of your Elastic
stack. You can drill down into the metrics to view more information about your
cluster and specific nodes, instances, and indices.

The Top Cluster Alerts shown on the Clusters page notify you of
conditions that require your attention:

* {es} Cluster Health Status is Yellow (missing at least one replica)
or Red (missing at least one primary).
* {es} Version Mismatch. You have {es} nodes with
different versions in the same cluster.
* {kib} Version Mismatch. You have {kib} instances with different
versions running against the same {es} cluster.
* Logstash Version Mismatch. You have Logstash nodes with different
versions reporting stats to the same monitoring cluster.
+
--
If you do not preserve the data directory when upgrading a {kib} or
Logstash node, the instance is assigned a new persistent UUID and shows up
as a new instance
--
* {xpack} License Expiration. When the {xpack} license expiration date
approaches, you will get notifications with a severity level relative to how
soon the expiration date is:
  ** 60 days: Informational alert
  ** 30 days: Low-level alert
  ** 15 days: Medium-level alert
  ** 7 days: Severe-level alert
+
The 60-day and 30-day thresholds are skipped for Trial licenses, which are only
valid for 30 days.

Monitoring checks the cluster alert conditions every minute. Cluster
alerts are automatically dismissed when the condition is resolved.
