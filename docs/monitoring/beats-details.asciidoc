To view an overview of the Beats data in the cluster, click *Overview*. The
overview page has a section for activity in the last day, which is a real-time
sample of data. Below that, a summary bar and charts follow the typical paradigm
of data in the Monitoring UI, which is bound to the span of the time picker in
the top right corner of the page. This overview page can therefore show
up-to-date or historical information.

To view a listing of the individual Beat instances in the cluster, click *Beats*.
The table listing shows each Beat instance that reports data to the monitoring
cluster. All columns are sortable. Clicking a Beat name takes you to the detail
page. For example:

The detail page contains a summary bar and charts. There are more charts on this
page than the overview page and they are specific to a single Beat instance.
