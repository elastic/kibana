Use the information in this section to troubleshoot common problems and find 
answers for frequently asked questions related to the {kib} {monitor-features}.

[float]
=== Cannot view the cluster because the license information is invalid

*Symptoms:*

The following error appears in a banner at the top of the screen in {kib} on the 
*Stack Monitoring > Clusters* page:
`You can't view the "<my_cluster>" cluster because the license information is invalid.`

*Resolution:*

You cannot monitor a version 6.3 or later cluster from {kib} version 6.2 or earlier. 
To resolve this issue, upgrade {kib} to 6.3 or later. See 
{stack-ref}/upgrading-elastic-stack.html[Upgrading the {stack}]. 

[float]
=== No monitoring data is visible in {kib}

*Symptoms:*

The *Stack Monitoring* page in {kib} is empty. 

*Resolution:*

. Confirm that {kib} is seeking monitoring data from the appropriate {es} URL.
By default, data is retrieved from the cluster specified in the 
`elasticsearch.hosts` setting in the `kibana.yml` file. If you want to retrieve it
from a different monitoring cluster, set `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts`.
See <<monitoring-settings-kb>>.

. Confirm that there is monitoring data available at that URL. It is stored in
indices such as `.monitoring-kibana-*` and `.monitoring-es-*`. At a minimum, you
must have monitoring data for the {es} production cluster. Once that data exists,
{kib} can display monitoring data for other products in the cluster.

. Set the time filter to “Last 1 hour”.  When monitoring data appears in your
cluster, the page automatically refreshes with the monitoring summary.
