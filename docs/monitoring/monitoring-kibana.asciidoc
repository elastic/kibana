=== Collecting {kib} monitoring data
++++
<titleabbrev>Collecting monitoring data</titleabbrev>
++++

If you enable the Elastic {monitor-features} in your cluster, you can 
optionally collect metrics about {kib}. 

The following method involves sending the metrics to the production cluster, 
which ultimately routes them to the monitoring cluster. For an alternative 
method, see <<monitoring-metricbeat>>. 

To learn about monitoring in general, see 
{stack-ov}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the {stack}]. 

. Set the `xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` setting to `true` on each
node in the production cluster. By default, it is is disabled (`false`). 
+ 
--
NOTE: You can specify this setting in either the `elasticsearch.yml` on each 
node or across the cluster as a dynamic cluster setting. If {es} 
{security-features} are enabled, you must have `monitor` cluster privileges to 
view the cluster settings and `manage` cluster privileges to change them.

--

** To update the cluster settings in {kib}:

... Open {kib} in your web browser. 
+
--
By default, if you are running {kib} locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`. 

If {es} {security-features} are enabled, log in. 
--

... In the side navigation, click *Stack Monitoring*. If data collection is
disabled, you are prompted to turn it on. 

** From the Console or command line, set `xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` 
to `true` on the production cluster. +
+
--
For example, you can use the following APIs to review and change this setting:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
GET _cluster/settings

PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled": true
  }
}
----------------------------------

For more information, see {ref}/monitoring-settings.html[Monitoring settings in {es}] 
and {ref}/cluster-update-settings.html[Cluster update settings].
--

. Verify that `xpack.monitoring.enabled` and
`xpack.monitoring.kibana.collection.enabled` are set to `true` in the 
`kibana.yml` file. These are the default values. For 
more information, see <<monitoring-settings-kb,Monitoring settings in {kib}>>.

. Identify where to send monitoring data. {kib} automatically
sends metrics to the {es} cluster specified in the `elasticsearch.hosts` setting
in the `kibana.yml` file. This property has a default value of
`http://localhost:9200`. +

[TIP] 
===============================
In production environments, we strongly recommend using a separate cluster 
(referred to as the _monitoring cluster_) to store the data. Using a separate 
monitoring cluster prevents production cluster outages from impacting your 
ability to access your monitoring data. It also prevents monitoring activities 
from impacting the performance of your production cluster. 

If {security} is enabled on the production cluster, use an HTTPS URL such
as `https://<your_production_cluster>:9200` in this setting.
===============================

--

. If the Elastic {security-features} are enabled on the production cluster:

.. Verify that there is a
valid user ID and password in the `elasticsearch.username` and
`elasticsearch.password` settings in the `kibana.yml` file. These values are
used when {kib} sends monitoring data to the production cluster.

.. Configure {kib} to encrypt communications between the {kib} server and the
production cluster. This set up involves generating a server certificate and
setting `server.ssl.*` and `elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities` settings
in the `kibana.yml` file on the {kib} server. For example:
+
--
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
server.ssl.key: /path/to/your/server.key
server.ssl.certificate: /path/to/your/server.crt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using your own certificate authority to sign certificates, specify
the location of the PEM file in the `kibana.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: /path/to/your/cacert.pem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
