{monitoring} in {kib} serves two separate purposes:

. To visualize monitoring data from across the Elastic Stack. You can view
health and performance data for {es}, Logstash, and Beats in real time, as well
as analyze past performance. For more information, see {xpack-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the Elastic Stack].

. To monitor {kib} itself and route that data to the monitoring cluster.

If you enable {monitoring} across the Elastic Stack, a monitoring agent runs on
each {es} node, Logstash node, {kib} instance, and Beat to collect and index
metrics. Each node and instance is considered unique based on its persistent
UUID, which is written to the <<settings,`path.data`>> directory when the node
or instance starts.
