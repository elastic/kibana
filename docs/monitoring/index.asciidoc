The {kib} {monitor-features} serve two separate purposes:

. To visualize monitoring data from across the {stack}. You can view health and 
performance data for {es}, {ls}, and Beats in real time, as well as analyze past 
performance. 
. To monitor {kib} itself and route that data to the monitoring cluster.

If you enable monitoring across the {stack}, each {es} node, {ls} node, {kib} 
instance, and Beat is considered unique based on its persistent
UUID, which is written to the <<settings,`path.data`>> directory when the node
or instance starts. 

NOTE: Watcher must be enabled to view cluster alerts. If you have a Basic
license, Top Cluster Alerts are not displayed.

For more information, see <<configuring-monitoring>> and 
{stack-ov}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the {stack}].
