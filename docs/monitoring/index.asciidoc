The {kib} {monitor-features} serve two separate purposes:

. To visualize monitoring data from across the {stack}. You can view health and 
performance data for {es}, {ls}, and Beats in real time, as well as analyze past 
performance. For more information, see 
{stack-ov}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the {stack}].

. To monitor {kib} itself and route that data to the monitoring cluster.

If you enable monitoring across the {stack}, each {es} node, {ls} node, {kib} 
instance, and Beat is considered unique based on its persistent
UUID, which is written to the <<settings,`path.data`>> directory when the node
or instance starts.
