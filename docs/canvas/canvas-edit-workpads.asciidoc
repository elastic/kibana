[[create-variables]]
=== Create variables

When you frequently use copy and paste, create variables to easily reuse strings and patterns. For example, when you clone a large workpad and need to connect your elements to a new index, use variables to update 
each element instead of updating them manually.

. Create the variables.
.. Expand the *Variables* options.
.. Click *Add a variable*. 
.. Specify the variable options, then click *Save changes*.

. Apply the variable.
.. Copy the variable.
.. Select the element you want to change, then open the expression editor. 
.. Paste the variable.

For example, to change the {data-source} for a set of charts:

. Specify the variable options.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/specify_variable_syntax.png[Variable syntax options]
+
. Copy the variable, then apply it to each element you want to update in the *Expression editor*.
