[[create-variables]]
=== Create variables

When you frequently use copy and paste, create variables to easily reuse strings and patterns. For example, when you clone a large workpad and need to connect your elements to a new index, use variables to update 
each element instead of updating them manually.

. Create the variables.
.. Click *Add a variable*. 
.. Specify the variable options, then click *Save changes*.

. Apply the variable.
.. Copy the variable.
.. Select the element you want to change, then open the expression editor. 
.. Paste the variable.

For example, to change the index pattern for a set of charts:

Specify the variable options.

Copy the variable, then apply it to each element you want to update in the *Expression editor*.
