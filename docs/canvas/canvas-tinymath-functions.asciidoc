=== TinyMath functions

beta[]This reference provides detailed information about the functions available in Tinymath. 
It lists what parameters each function accepts and the return value of that function. 
It also provides examples of how each function behaves.

Most of the functions accept arrays and apply JavaScript Math methods to each 
element of that array. For the functions that accept multiple arrays as parameters,
the function generally does calculation index by index.

You can wrap any function by another function as long as the return type of 
the inner function matches the acceptable parameter type of the outer function.
