[[element-intro]]
== Design your workpad

With elements, you can combine images, text, charts, and more to tell a story about your data. You can create your own elements and connect them to your data sources, add saved objects that you created outside of Canvas, and add your own images.

[[add-canvas-element]]
=== Create elements

Create the elements to display on your workpad, then familiarize yourself with the element using the preconfigured demo data. By default, most of the elements you create use demo data until you change the data source. The demo data includes a small sample data set that you can use to experiment with your element.

To create an element, click *Add element*, then select the element you want to use.

Play around with the default settings and see what the element can do. When you're finished, connect the element to your data by selecting *Data*, then clicking *Change your data source*. Canvas supports the following data sources:

* *{es} SQL* - Access your data in {es} using SQL syntax. For information about SQL syntax, refer to {ref}/sql-spec.html[SQL language].

* *{es} raw data* - Access your raw data in {es} without the use of aggregations. Use {es} raw data when you have low volume datasets, or to plot exact, non-aggregated values.

* *Timelion* - Access your time series data using <<timelion,Timelion>> queries. To use Timelion queries, you can enter a query using the <<lucene-query,Lucene Query Syntax>>.

When you're ready to save your element, select the element, then click the *Save as new element* icon. To save a group of elements, press and hold Shift, then select the elements you want to save.
