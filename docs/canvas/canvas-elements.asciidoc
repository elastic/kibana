== Showcase your data with elements

Canvas _elements_ are the building blocks of your workpad. With elements, you can combine images, text, and visualizations to tell a story about your data.

When you add elements to your workpad, you can:

* <<connect-element-data,Connect the elements to your live data>>

* <<configure-display-options,Choose how you want the element to appear on your workpad>>

* <<configure-auto-refresh-interval,Change the data refresh interval>>

* <<organize-element,Move and arrange elements on your workpad>>

* <<element-save,Save your elements>>

[[canvas-supported-datasources]]
=== Supported data sources

By default, every element you add to a workpad uses demo data until you change the data source. The demo data includes a small sample data set that you can use to experiment with your element. When you have finished using the demo data, connect the element to one of the following data sources:

Elasticsearch SQL:: Allows you to access your data in Elasticsearch using SQL syntax. Unfamiliar with writing Elasticsearch SQL queries? For more information, refer to {ref}/sql-spec.html[SQL language].

Elasticsearch raw data:: Allows you to access your raw data in Elasticsearch without the use of aggregations. Use Elasticsearch raw data when you have low volume datasets, or to plot exact, non-aggregated values.
To use targeted queries, you can enter a query using the Lucene query string syntax. For more information about the Lucene query string sytax, refer to <<lucene-query,Lucene Query Syntax>>.

Timelion:: To use time series data in Canvas, connect elements to Timelion, which uses Timelion queries to pull time series data in a tabular format. Timelion queries use the Lucene query string syntax. For information about the Lucene query string syntax, refer to <<lucene-query,Lucene Query Syntax>>.
For information about Timelion, refer to <<timelion,Timelion>>.
