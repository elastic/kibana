. To familiarize yourself with the element, use the preconfigured data demo data.
+
By default, most of the elements you create use demo data until you change the data source. The demo data includes a small data set that you can use to experiment with your element.

. To connect the element to your data, select *Data*, then select one of the following data sources:

* *{es} SQL* &mdash; Access your data in {es} using SQL syntax. For information about SQL syntax, refer to {ref}/sql-spec.html[SQL language].

* *{es} documents* &mdash; Access your data in {es} without using aggregations. To use, select an index and fields, and optionally enter a query using the <<lucene-query,Lucene Query Syntax>>. Use the *{es} documents* data source when you have low volume datasets, to view raw documents, or to plot exact, non-aggregated values on a chart.

* *Timelion* &mdash; Access your time series data using <<timelion,Timelion>> queries. To use Timelion queries, you can enter a query using the <<lucene-query,Lucene Query Syntax>>.

Each element can display a different data source. Pages and workpads often contain multiple data sources.
