== Canvas function reference

beta[] Behind the scenes, Canvas is driven by a powerful expression language,
with dozens of functions and many more capabilities including table transforms, 
type casting, and sub-expressions. Most of the time, this functionality is hidden, 
but because youâ€™ve come to the function reference, you must be interested in
how these functions work.

For the purpose of this documentation, 
these functions are divided by the environment they run in:

* <<canvas-common-functions>> run on the {kib} server, in the browser, or wherever is 
best for performance.
* <<canvas-server-functions>> can only execute on the server.
* <<canvas-client-functions>> must execute in a browser.

The Canvas expression language also supports <<canvas-tinymath-functions>>, which
you can use to perform complex math calculations.
