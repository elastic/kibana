== Canvas function reference

Behind the scenes, Canvas is driven by a powerful expression language,
with dozens of functions and other capabilities, including table transforms, 
type casting, and sub-expressions.

For the purpose of this documentation, 
the Canvas functions are divided by the environment they run in:

* <<canvas-common-functions>> can run anywhere
* <<canvas-server-functions>> can only execute on the server
* <<canvas-client-functions>> must execute in a browser

The Canvas expression language also supports <<canvas-tinymath-functions>>, which
perform complex math calculations.
