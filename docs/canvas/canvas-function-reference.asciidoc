== Canvas function reference

beta[] Behind the scenes, Canvas is driven by a powerful expression language,
with dozens of functions and many more capabilities, including table transforms, 
type casting, and sub-expressions. Most of the time, this functionality is hidden, 
but because youâ€™ve come to the function reference, you must be interested in
how these functions work.

For the purpose of this documentation, 
the Canvas functions are divided by the environment they run in:

* <<canvas-common-functions>> can run anywhere.
* <<canvas-server-functions>> can only execute on the server.
* <<canvas-client-functions>> must execute in a browser.

The Canvas expression language also supports <<canvas-tinymath-functions>>, which
perform complex math calculations.
