=== Create a workpad

When you create a workpad, you'll start with a blank page, or you can choose a workpad that is already started for you. 

. Open *Canvas*.

. Choose one of the following options:

* To start with a single, blank workpad, click *Create workpad*.

* To create a workpad from a template, select *Templates*, then select a preconfigured template.

* To import an existing workpad, click and drag a workpad JSON file to the *Import workpad JSON file* field.

For advanced workpad examples, add a {kibana-ref}/add-sample-data.html[sample Kibana data set], then select *Canvas* from the *View Data* dropdown list.
