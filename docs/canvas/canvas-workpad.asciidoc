=== Using the workpad

You have a workpad you can mess with, so let’s mess with it. We’ll start 
out easy and make a couple simple changes. 

. Click the gauge chart in the top left (fun fact, these are actually pie charts). 
. Try clicking the little red slice. If you click the number, you'll notice 
you’ve actually selected a number element, not the gauge itself. 
+ 
This element is now selected. Off to the left, you'll see that the side bar has changed. 
This is where you can make changes to the element.

. Try changing the color palette. Easy right? Click the Back button in your 
browser to undo your change.

. Try dragging the chart around the page. Grab the resize handles to make 
the chart bigger and smaller.

You can now click somewhere off of the element, but not on another element, 
to deselect it. You will notice the sidebar changing again. You now have 
access to the page and workpad-level settings. Feel free to change the page 
background color or rename your workpad.

Speaking of pages, Canvas workpads have multiple pages.

. Click the arrow to the right of the *Page 1 of 2* text in the toolbar at the bottom. 
You'll see a whole new view of the the eCommerce data.
. Click the *Page 1 of 2* text to see a live preview of all of the pages in your 
workpad.
. Click the (+) button to create a new, blank page.
. Click the *Add element* button in the top right hand corner of the page.
. Add an *Area Chart.*

You should now have a three-page workpad wired, and a new element connected 
to some demo data.  Your next stop should probably be “Datasources and the 
elements that love them” to learn how to take your new element and wire it 
up to some real data.
