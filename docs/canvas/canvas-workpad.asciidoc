=== Create workpads

Whether you are ready to start from scratch, or need a little jump start, it's time to get that creative idea out of your head and into Canvas!

When you create a workpad, you'll start with a single blank page, ready for you to build from the ground up. If the prospect of a blank page has you feeling uneasy, visit the template tab for a growing list of workpads that you can clone and edit.

For advanced example workpads, install one or more of the sample Kibana data sets, then find the related sample workpads on the Canvas home page.
