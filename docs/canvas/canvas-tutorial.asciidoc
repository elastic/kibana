== Canvas tutorial

To get up and running with Canvas, use the following tutorial where you'll create a display for monitoring sales at an eCommerce store.

=== Before you begin

For this tutorial, you'll need to add the <<add-sample-data, Sample eCommerce orders data>>.

[float]
=== Create and personalize your workpad

Your first step to working with Canvas is to create a workpad.

. Open *Canvas*.

. Click *Create workpad*.

. To add a *Name* for your workpad, use the editor. For example, `My Canvas Workpad`.

=== Customize your workpad with images

To customize your workpad to look the way you want, add your own images.

. Click *Add element*, then click *Image*.
+
The default Elastic logo image appears on your page.

. To replace the Elastic logo with your own image, select the image, then use the editor.

. To move the image, click and drag it to your preferred location.

You'll notice that the image is tagged as an asset, which allows you to reuse the image from *Manage assets*.

=== Customize your data with metrics

Customize your data by connecting it to the Sample eCommerce orders data.

. Click *Add element*, then click *Metric*.
+
By default, the *Metric* element is connected to a demo data source, which enables you to experiment with the element before you connect it to your own data source.

. To connect the element to your own data source, make sure that the element is selected, then click *Data*.

.. Click *Change your data source*, then click *Elasticsearch SQL*.

.. In the *Elasticsearch SQL query* field, enter the following query:
+
`SELECT sum(taxless_total_price) AS sum_total_price FROM "kibana_sample_data_ecommerce"`
+
The query selects the total price field and sets it to the sum_total_price field. These fields are pulled from the kibana_sample_data_ecommerce index that you installed.

.. To verify that the data is correct, click *Preview*. If you like what you see, click *Save*.
+
At this point, the element displays an error.

. Specify how to process and display the data.

.. Click *Display*

.. Under *Number*, select *Value* from the function drop-down list, then select *sum_total_price* from the column drop-down list.

.. Change the *Label* to `Total sales`.
+
You'll notice that the error is gone, but the number could use some formatting.

. To format the number, use the Canvas expression language.

.. Click *Expression editor*.
+
You're now looking at the raw data syntax that Canvas uses to display the element.

.. Look for `math "sum_total_price"`, then add `| formatNumber "$0a"`.

.. To update the number, click *Run*.

=== Show off your data with charts

To show what your data can do, add charts, graphs, progress monitors, and more to your workpad.

. Click *Add element*, then click *Area chart*.

. To connect the element to your own data source, make sure that the element is selected, then click *Data*.

.. Click *Change your data source*, then click *Elasticsearch SQL*.

.. To obtain the taxless total price by date, enter the following into the *Elasticsearch SQL query* field:
+
`SELECT order_date, taxless_total_price FROM "kibana_sample_data_ecommerce" ORDER BY order_date`
+
Although you used the Elasticsearch SQL data source for the metric and area chart elements, each element can display a different data source. Pages and workpads often contain multiple data sources.

.. To verify that the data is correct, click *Preview*. If you like what you see, click *Save*.

. Specify how to display the data.

.. Click *Display*

.. From the *X-axis* drop-down lists, select *Value*, then select *order_date*.

.. From the *Y-axis* drop-down lists, select *Value*, then select *taxless_total_price*.

=== Show how your data changes over time

To focus your data on a specific time range, add a time filter to your workpad.

. Click *Add element*, then click *Time filter*.

. Specify how to display the data.

.. Click *Display*

.. To use the date time field from the sample data, enter `order_date` in the *Column* field, then click *Set*.

To see how the data changes, set the time filter to *Last 7 days*. As you change the time filter options, the metrics dynamically update.

Your workpad is now complete! From the workpad menu, use the icons to:

* Configure the refresh rate for your data

* Refresh the data that displays on your workpad

* Display your workpad in fullscreen mode

* Control the zoom options

* Share your workpad

* Hide the editing controls

=== Next steps
Now that you know the Canvas basics, you're ready to explore on your own.

Here are some things to try:

* Play with the {kibana-ref}/add-sample-data.html[sample Canvas workpads].

* Build presentations of your own live data with <<create-canvas-workpad,workpads>>.

* Learn more about <<add-canvas-elements,elements>> &mdash; the building blocks of your workpad.

* Deep dive into the {kibana-ref}/canvas-function-reference.html[expression language and functions] that drive Canvas.
