[[add-workpad-website]]
=== Share the workpad on a website

beta[] Canvas allows you to create _shareables_, which are workpads that you download and securely share on any website. To customize the behavior of the workpad on your website, you can choose to autoplay the pages or hide the workpad toolbar.

. If you are using a Gold or Platinum license, enable reporting in your `config/kibana.yml` file.

. From your workpad, click the *Share this workpad* icon in the upper left corner, then select *Share on a website*.

. On the *Share on a website* pane, follow the instructions.

. To customize the workpad behavior to autoplay the pages or hide the toolbar, use the inline parameters.
+
To make sure that your data remains secure, the data in the JSON file is not connected to {kib}. Canvas does not display elements that manipulate the data on the workpad.
