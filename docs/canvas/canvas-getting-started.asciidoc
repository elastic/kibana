== Getting started with Canvas

Before you start this tutorial, <<add-sample-data, add the eCommerce sample data set>>. 
Each sample data set includes a Canvas workpad to go along with the data. Once you've 
added the data, open *Canvas* and click the name of the *[eCommerce] Revenue Tracking* workpad.

Let's make a copy of this workpad so we don't have to worry about making a mess 
of it in this tutorial. 

. Click the name of the workpad in the lower left hand corner. 
+
You’ll notice this is similar to the first screen. You could switch to a new 
workpad from here, but let's not for now.

. Click the *Clone* icon in the *[eCommerce] Revenue Tracking* row.
+
You now have a new workpad called *[eCommerce] Revenue Tracking - Copy*.

=== Play around with the workpad

Let's start out by making a few stylistic changes. 

. Click the gauge chart in the top left of the workpad (fun fact, these are actually pie charts). 
Click on the small red slice - if you click the number, you'll notice that
you’ve actually selected a number element, not the gauge itself. 
+ 
This element is now selected. Off to the right, you'll see that the side bar has changed. 
This is where you can make changes to the element.

. Try changing the color palette. Click the Back button in your 
browser to undo your change.

. Try dragging the chart around the page. Grab the resize handles to make 
the chart bigger and smaller.

. Now click somewhere off of the element, but not on another element, 
to deselect it. 
+
You will notice the sidebar changing again. You now have 
access to the page and workpad-level settings. Feel free to change the page 
background color or rename your workpad.

Speaking of pages, Canvas workpads can have multiple pages:

. Click the arrow to the right of the *Page 1 of 2* text in the toolbar at the bottom
of the page. You'll see a whole new view of the the eCommerce data.
. Click the *Page 2 of 2* text to see a live preview of all of the pages in your 
workpad.
. Click the (+) button to create a new, blank page.
. Click the *Add element* button in the top right hand corner of the page.
. Add an *Area Chart.*

=== Changing your data source
You now have a three-page workpad, and a new element connected to some demo data.  
Your next step is to wire your new element up to some real data. 

Click on the *Data* tab in the right sidebar menu and click "Change your data source" 
to start working with your {es} data.
