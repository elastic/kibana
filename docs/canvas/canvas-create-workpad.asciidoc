== Create a new workpad

Canvas is a creative space for presenting data. You can create a Canvas workpad 
to combine colors, shapes, and text, to bring dynamic, pixel-perfect data displays 
to screens large and small. 

A Canvas workpad is your drawing space. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create
and configure your own workpad, and add text, data elements, and visual assets. 

Before you start, you will need to have your own {es} data source connected in {kib}, 
or you can use one of {kib}'s <<add-sample-data, sample data sets>>.

=== Working with elements
Elements are individual components that can be placed on a workpad, and configured
to suit your presentation. You can use elements to add text, logos, and images.
An element can also be connected to a data source to display live data in your workpad.

Adding assets::

Displaying data:: 
* Click *Add element* to choose from available data elements, such as a coordinate plot,

* The new element is connected to some demo data, so you will need to edit its 
*Data* source to connect the element to the data you want to display. 
* Click on the element in the workpad to open the sidebar editor. From this editor, 
you to can edit an element's *Display* settings and *Data* source.
