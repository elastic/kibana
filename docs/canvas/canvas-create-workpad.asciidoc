== Create a new workpad

Canvas is a creative space for presenting data. You can create a Canvas workpad 
to combine colors, shapes, and text, to bring dynamic, pixel-perfect data displays 
to screens large and small. A workpad is your drawing space that you can configure 
to add text, data elements, and visual assets. 

Before you start, you will need to have your own {es} data source connected in {kib}, 
or you can use one of {kib}'s <<add-sample-data, sample data sets>>.

=== Starting a new project

dark template. Each template includes placeholder text, images, and styles to help you
get started. 

You can also click *Create workpad* to start from scratch.

=== Working with elements
Elements are individual components that can be placed on a workpad, and configured
to suit your presentation. You can use elements to add text, logos, and images.
An element can also be connected to a data source to display live data in your workpad.

Adding text::  
* Click *Add element* on the top right, and select *Markdown* to add a text box to your workpad.
* Click on the text box in the workpad to reveal the *Markdown* menu on the right hand
side. From this menu you can add text content, and configure text styles.

Adding assets:: 
* Click *Manage assets* to import new images
* Select an image from your library to add an image element to your workpad

Displaying data:: 
* Click *Add element* to choose from available data elements, such as a coordinate plot, 
line chart, pie chart, and more. Select an element type to add it to your workpad.
* The new element is connected to some demo data, so you will need to edit its 
*Data* source to connect the element to the data you want to display. 
* Click on the element in the workpad to open the sidebar editor. From this editor, 
you to can edit an element's *Display* settings and *Data* source. 
* You can also open the *Expression editor* on the bottom right to bypass the sidebar
editor and edit the expression associated with an element directly.

=== Working with data sources 
Each Canvas element is connected to some demo data by default. Once you place the 
element on your workpad, you can configure it to display your own data.

Each element can display a different data source. Pages and workpads often contain multiple data sources.

From the sidebar editor, click *Data > Change your data source* to connect a new 
data source to your element.

There are four types of data sources to choose from: 

Timelion::
* Uses <<timelion-inline-help, Timelion syntax>> to retrieve a timeseries
Demo data::
* Provides mock data set (connected to sample elements by default)
Elasticsearch SQL::
* Uses {ref}/sql-overview.html[{es} SQL] to get a data table
{es} raw documents:: 
* Pulls back raw documents from an {es} index

After you change the data source for an element, next you need to tell the element
how to process and display that data. Select the element, and click *Display* in the 
sidebar to specify the values that the element should display.

=== Adding a new page
You can add additional pages to your Canvas workpad to build out your presentation. 
Pages are similar to slides in a presentation. 

. From the bottom of the page click *Page 1 of ...* to view all existing pages. 
. Click *+* on the righthand side to add a new page.
