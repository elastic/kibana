## EmbeddableRenderer variable

Helper react component to render an embeddable Can be used if you have an embeddable object or an embeddable factory Supports updating input by passing `input` prop

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
EmbeddableRenderer: <I extends EmbeddableInput>(props: EmbeddableRendererProps<I>) => JSX.Element
```

## Remarks

This component shouldn't be used inside an embeddable container to render embeddable children because children may lose inherited input, here is why:

When passing `input` inside a prop, internally there is a call:

```ts
embeddable.updateInput(input);

```
If you are simply rendering an embeddable, it's no problem.

However when you are dealing with containers, you want to be sure to only pass into updateInput the actual state that changed. This is because calling child.updateInput(<!-- -->{ foo }<!-- -->) will make foo explicit state. It cannot be inherited from it's parent.

For example, on a dashboard, the time range is inherited by all children, unless they had their time range set explicitly. This is how "per panel time range" works. That action calls embeddable.updateInput(<!-- -->{ timeRange }<!-- -->), and the time range will no longer be inherited from the container.
