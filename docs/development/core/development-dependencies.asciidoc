=== Managing Dependencies

While developing plugins for use in the Kibana front-end environment you will
probably want to include a library or two (at least). While that should be
simple to do 90% of the time, there are always outliers, and some of those
outliers are very popular projects.

Before you can use an external library with Kibana you have to install it. You
do that using...

==== npm (preferred method)

Once you've http://npmsearch.com[found] a dependency you want to add, you can
install it like so:

["source","shell"]
-----------
npm install --save some-neat-library
-----------

At the top of a javascript file, just import the library using it's name:

["source","shell"]
-----------
import someNeatLibrary from 'some-neat-library';
-----------

Just like working in node.js, front-end code can require node modules installed
by npm without any additional configuration.
