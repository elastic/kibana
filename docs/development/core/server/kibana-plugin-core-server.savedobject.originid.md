## SavedObject.originId property

The ID of the saved object this originated from. This is set if this object's `id` was regenerated; that can happen during migration from a legacy single-namespace type, or during import. It is only set during migration or create operations. This is used during import to ensure that ID regeneration is deterministic, so saved objects will be overwritten if they are imported multiple times into a given space.

```typescript
originId?: string;
