## SavedObjectsImportHook type

A hook associated with a specific saved object type, that will be invoked during the import process. The hook will have access to the objects of the registered type.

Currently, the only supported feature for import hooks is to return warnings to be displayed in the UI when the import succeeds.

 The only interactions the hook can have with the import process is via the hook's response. Mutating the objects inside the hook's code will have no effect.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type SavedObjectsImportHook<T = unknown> = (objects: Array<SavedObject<T>>) => SavedObjectsImportHookResult | Promise<SavedObjectsImportHookResult>;
```
