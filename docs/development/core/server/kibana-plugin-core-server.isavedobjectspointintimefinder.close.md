## ISavedObjectsPointInTimeFinder.close property

Closes the Point-In-Time associated with this finder instance.

Once you have retrieved all of the results you need, it is recommended to call `close()` to clean up the PIT and prevent Elasticsearch from consuming resources unnecessarily. This is only required if you are done iterating and have not yet paged through all of the results: the PIT will automatically be closed for you once you reach the last page of results, or if the underlying call to `find` fails for any reason.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
close: () => Promise<void>;
```
