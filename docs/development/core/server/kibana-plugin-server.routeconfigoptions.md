## RouteConfigOptions interface

Additional route options.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface RouteConfigOptions<Method extends RouteMethod = any> 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [accepts](./kibana-plugin-server.routeconfigoptions.accepts.md) | <code>Method extends 'get' ? never : RouteContentType &#124; RouteContentType[] &#124; string &#124; string[]</code> | Default value: allows parsing of the following mime types: \* application/json \* application/\*+json \* application/octet-stream \* application/x-www-form-urlencoded \* multipart/form-data \* text/\* A string or an array of strings with the allowed mime types for the endpoint. Use this settings to limit the set of allowed mime types. Note that allowing additional mime types not listed above will not enable them to be parsed, and if parse is true, the request will result in an error response. |
|  [authRequired](./kibana-plugin-server.routeconfigoptions.authrequired.md) | <code>boolean</code> | A flag shows that authentication for a route: <code>enabled</code> when true <code>disabled</code> when false<!-- -->Enabled by default. |
|  [maxBytes](./kibana-plugin-server.routeconfigoptions.maxbytes.md) | <code>Method extends 'get' ? never : number</code> | Default value: The one set in the kibana.yml config file under the parameter <code>server.maxPayloadBytes</code>. Limits the size of incoming payloads to the specified byte count. Allowing very large payloads may cause the server to run out of memory. |
|  [output](./kibana-plugin-server.routeconfigoptions.output.md) | <code>Method extends 'get' ? never : 'data' &#124; 'stream' &#124; 'file'</code> | Default value: 'data'. The processed payload format. The value must be one of: \* 'data' - the incoming payload is read fully into memory. If parse is true, the payload is parsed (JSON, form-decoded, multipart) based on the 'Content-Type' header. If parse is false, a raw Buffer is returned. \* 'stream' - the incoming payload is made available via a Stream.Readable interface. If the payload is 'multipart/form-data' and parse is true, field values are presented as text while files are provided as streams. File streams from a 'multipart/form-data' upload will also have a hapi property containing the filename and headers properties. Note that payload streams for multipart payloads are a synthetic interface created on top of the entire mutlipart content loaded into memory. To avoid loading large multipart payloads into memory, set parse to false and handle the multipart payload in the handler using a streaming parser (e.g. pez). \* 'file' - the incoming payload is written to temporary file in the directory specified by the uploads settings. If the payload is 'multipart/form-data' and parse is true, field values are presented as text while files are saved to disk. Note that it is the sole responsibility of the application to clean up the files generated by the framework. This can be done by keeping track of which files are used (e.g. using the request.app object), and listening to the server 'response' event to perform cleanup. |
|  [parse](./kibana-plugin-server.routeconfigoptions.parse.md) | <code>Method extends 'get' ? never : boolean &#124; 'gunzip'</code> | Default value: true. Determines if the incoming payload is processed or presented raw. Available values: \* true - if the request 'Content-Type' matches the allowed mime types set by allow (for the whole payload as well as parts), the payload is converted into an object when possible. If the format is unknown, a Bad Request (400) error response is sent. Any known content encoding is decoded. \* false - the raw payload is returned unmodified. \* 'gunzip' - the raw payload is returned unmodified after any known content encoding is decoded. |
|  [tags](./kibana-plugin-server.routeconfigoptions.tags.md) | <code>readonly string[]</code> | Additional metadata tag strings to attach to the route. |
