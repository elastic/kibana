## HttpServiceSetup.registerOnPreAuth property

To define custom logic to perform for incoming requests.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
registerOnPreAuth: (handler: OnPreAuthHandler) => void;
```

## Remarks

Runs the handler before Auth interceptor performs a check that user has access to requested resources, so it's the only place when you can forward a request to another URL right on the server. Can register any number of registerOnPostAuth, which are called in sequence (from the first registered to the last). See [OnPreAuthHandler](./kibana-plugin-server.onpreauthhandler.md)<!-- -->.
