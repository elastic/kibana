## StatusServiceSetup.derivedStatus$ property

The status of this plugin as derived from its dependencies.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
derivedStatus$: Observable<ServiceStatus>;
```

## Remarks

By default, plugins inherit this derived status from their dependencies. Calling  overrides this default status.

This may emit multiple times for a single status change event as propagates through the dependency tree
