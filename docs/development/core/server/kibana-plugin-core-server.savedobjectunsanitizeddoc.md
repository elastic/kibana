## SavedObjectUnsanitizedDoc type

We want to have two types, one that guarantees a "references" attribute will exist and one that allows it to be null. Since we're not migrating all the saved objects to have a "references" array, we need to support the scenarios where it may be missing (ex migrations).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type SavedObjectUnsanitizedDoc = SavedObjectDoc & Partial<Referencable>;
```
