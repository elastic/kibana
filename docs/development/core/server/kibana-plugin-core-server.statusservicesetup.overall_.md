## StatusServiceSetup.overall$ property

Overall system status for all of Kibana.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
overall$: Observable<ServiceStatus>;
```

## Remarks

The level of the overall status will reflect the most severe status of any core service or plugin.

Exposed only for reporting purposes to outside systems and should not be used by plugins. Instead, plugins should only depend on the statuses of [Core](./kibana-plugin-core-server.statusservicesetup.core_.md) or their dependencies.
