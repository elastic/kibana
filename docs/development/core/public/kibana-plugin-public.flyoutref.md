## FlyoutRef class

A FlyoutRef is a reference to an opened flyout panel. It offers methods to close the flyout panel again. If you open a flyout panel you should make sure you call `close()` when it should be closed. Since a flyout could also be closed by a user or from another flyout being opened, you must bind to the `onClose` Promise on the FlyoutRef instance. The Promise will resolve whenever the flyout was closed at which point you should discard the FlyoutRef.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class FlyoutRef 
```
