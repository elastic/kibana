## SavedObjectsClientContract.resolve() method

Resolves a single object

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
resolve<T = unknown>(type: string, id: string): Promise<ResolvedSimpleSavedObject<T>>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  type | string |  |
|  id | string |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;ResolvedSimpleSavedObject&lt;T&gt;&gt;

The resolve result for the saved object for the given type and id.

 Saved objects that Kibana fails to find are replaced with an error object and an "exactMatch" outcome. The rationale behind the outcome is that "exactMatch" is the default outcome, and the outcome only changes if an alias is found. This behavior for the `resolve` API is unique to the public client, which batches individual calls with `bulkResolve` under the hood. We don't throw an error in that case for legacy compatibility reasons.
