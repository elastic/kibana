## ChromeNavLink.url property

A url that legacy apps can set to deep link into their applications.

NOTE: Currently used by the "lastSubUrl" feature legacy/ui/chrome. This should be removed once the ApplicationService is implemented and mounting apps. At that time, each app can handle opening to the previous location when they are mounted.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly url?: string;
```
