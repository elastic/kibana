## modifyUrl() function

Takes a URL and a function that takes the meaningful parts of the URL as a key-value object, modifies some or all of the parts, and returns the modified parts formatted again as a url.

Url Parts sent: - protocol - slashes (does the url have the //) - auth - hostname (just the name of the host, no port or auth information) - port - pathname (the path after the hostname, no query or hash, starts with a slash if there was a path) - query (always an object, even when no query on original url) - hash

Why? - The default url library in node produces several conflicting properties on the "parsed" output. Modifying any of these might lead to the modifications being ignored (depending on which property was modified) - It's not always clear whether to use path/pathname, host/hostname, so this tries to add helpful constraints

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function modifyUrl(url: string, urlModifier: (urlParts: URLMeaningfulParts) => Partial<URLMeaningfulParts> | void): string;
```
