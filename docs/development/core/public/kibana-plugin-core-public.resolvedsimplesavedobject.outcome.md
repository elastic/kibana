## ResolvedSimpleSavedObject.outcome property

The outcome for a successful `resolve` call is one of the following values:

\* `'exactMatch'` -- One document exactly matched the given ID. \* `'aliasMatch'` -- One document with a legacy URL alias matched the given ID; in this case the `saved_object.id` field is different than the given ID. \* `'conflict'` -- Two documents matched the given ID, one was an exact match and another with a legacy URL alias; in this case the `saved_object` object is the exact match, and the `saved_object.id` field is the same as the given ID.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
outcome: SavedObjectsResolveResponse['outcome'];
```
