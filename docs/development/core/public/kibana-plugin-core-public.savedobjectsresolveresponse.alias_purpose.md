## SavedObjectsResolveResponse.alias\_purpose property

The reason this alias was created.

Currently this is used to determine whether or not a toast should be shown when a user is redirected from a legacy URL; if the alias was created because of saved object conversion, then we will display a toast telling the user that the object has a new URL.

\*\*Note:\*\* this field is \*only\* included when an alias was found (in other words, when the outcome is `'aliasMatch'` or `'conflict'`<!-- -->).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
alias_purpose?: 'savedObjectConversion' | 'savedObjectImport';
```
