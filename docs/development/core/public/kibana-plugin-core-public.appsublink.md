## AppSubLink type

Input type for registering secondary in-app locations for an application.

Sublinks must include at least one of `path` or `subLinks`<!-- -->. A sublink that does not have a `path` represents a topological level in the application's hierarchy, but does not have a destination URL that is user-accessible.

Used to populate navigational search results (where available).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type AppSubLink = {
    id: string;
    title: string;
} & ({
    path: string;
    subLinks?: AppSubLink[];
} | {
    path?: string;
    subLinks: AppSubLink[];
});
```
