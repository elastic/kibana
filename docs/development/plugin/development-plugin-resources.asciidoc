=== Plugin Resources

Here are some resources that will be helpful for getting started with plugin development

[float]
==== Our IRC channel
Many Kibana developers hang out on `irc.freenode.net` in the `#kibana` channel. We *want* to help you with plugin development. Even more than that, we *want your help* in understanding your plugin goals so we can build a great plugin system for you! If you've never used IRC, welcome to the fun. You can get started with the http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=kibana[Freenode Web Client].

==== Some light reading
- Our {repo}blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[contributing guide] can help you get a development environment going
- Tim Roes' excellent blog series https://www.timroes.de/2016/02/21/writing-kibana-plugins-custom-applications/[Writing Kibana Plugins]

==== Plugin Generator

It is recommended that you kick-start your plugin by generating it with the {repo}tree/{branch}/packages/kbn-plugin-generator[Kibana Plugin Generator]. Run the following within the Kibana repo and you will be asked a couple questions, see some progress bars, and have a freshly generated plugin ready for you to play within Kibana's sibling `kibana-extra` folder.

["source","shell"]
-----------
node scripts/generate_plugin my_plugin_name # replace "my_plugin_name" with your desired plugin name
-----------


[float]
==== Directory structure for plugins

The Kibana directory must be named `kibana`, and your plugin directory must be located within the sibling `kibana-extra` folder, for example:

["source","shell"]
-----------
.
├── kibana
├── kibana-extra/foo-plugin
└── kibana-extra/bar-plugin
-----------
