== Developing Visualizations

Kibana Visualizations are the easiest way to add additional functionality to Kibana. 
This part of documentation is split into two parts. 
The first part tells you all you need to know on how to embed existing Kibana Visualizations in your plugin. 
The second step explains how to create your own custom visualization.

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
These pages document internal APIs and are not guaranteed to be supported across future versions of Kibana. 
However, these docs will be kept up-to-date to reflect the current implementation of Visualization plugins in Kibana.
