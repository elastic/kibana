== Developing Visualizations

Easiest way to add new visualizations to kibana or to show existing kibana visualizations in your plugin is using 
Visualize Plugin. This part of documentation is split into two parts. First part will tell you all you need to know to
use existing kibana visualization in your plugin and second step will focus on creating your own custom visualization.
