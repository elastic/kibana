[[development-security-rbac]]
=== Role-based access control

Role-based access control (RBAC) in {kib} relies upon the {ref}/security-api-privileges.html[privilege APIs] that Elasticsearch exposes. This {kib} to define the privileges that {kib} wishes to grant to users, assign them to the relevant users using roles, and then authorize the user to perform a specific action. This is handled within a secured instance of the `SavedObjectsClient` and available transparently to consumers when using `request.getSavedObjectsClient()` or `savedObjects.getScopedSavedObjectsClient()`.

[[development-rbac-privileges]]
==== {kib} Privileges

When {kib} first starts up, it executes the following `POST` request against {es}. This synchronizes the definition of the privileges with various `actions` which are later used to authorize a user:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
POST /_xpack/security/privilege
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic kibana changeme

{
   "kibana-.kibana":{
       "all":{
           "application":"kibana-.kibana",
           "name":"all",
           "actions":[
               "version:7.0.0-alpha1-SNAPSHOT",
               "action:login",
               "action:*"
           ],
           "metadata":{}
       },
       "read":{
           "application":"kibana-.kibana",
           "name":"read",
           "actions":[
               "version:7.0.0-alpha1-SNAPSHOT",
               "action:login",
               "action:saved_objects/dashboard/get",
               "action:saved_objects/dashboard/bulk_get",
               "action:saved_objects/dashboard/find",
               ...
           ],"metadata":{}}
   }
}
----------------------------------

[NOTE]
==============================================

The application is created by concatenating the prefix of `kibana-` with the value of `kibana.index` from the `kibana.yml`, so different {kib} tenants are isolated from one another.

[[development-rbac-assigning-privileges]]
==== Assigning {kib} Privileges

{kib} privileges are assigned to specific roles using the `applications` element. For example, the following role assigns the <<kibana-privileges-all, all>> privilege at `*` `resources` (which will in the future be used to secure spaces) to the default {kib} `application`:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
"new_kibana_user": {
   "applications": [
     {
       "application": "kibana-.kibana",
       "privileges": [
         "all"
       ],
       "resources": [
         "*"
       ]
     }
   ]
 }
----------------------------------

Roles that grant <<kibana-privileges>> should be managed using the <<role-management-api>> or the *Management* / *Security* / *Roles* page, not directly using the {es} {ref}/security-api-roles.html[Role Management API]. This role can then be assigned to users using {es}'s {ref}/security-api-users.html[User Management APIs].

[[development-rbac-authorization]]
==== Authorization

The {es} {ref}/security-api-privileges.html#security-api-privileges[has privileges API]determines whether the user is authorized to perform a specific action:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
POST /_xpack/security/user/_has_privileges
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic foo_read_only_user password

{
   "applications":[
       {
           "application":"kibana-.kibana",
           "resources":["*"],
           "privileges":[
             "action:saved_objects/dashboard/save",
           ]
       }
   ]
}
----------------------------------

{es} checks if the user is granted a specific action. If the user is assigned a role that grants a privilege, {es} uses the <<development-rbac-privileges, {kib} privileges>> definition to associate this with the actions, which makes authorizing users more intuitive and flexible programatically.

Once we have authorized the user to perform a specific action, we can execute the request using `callWithInternalUser`.

[[development-rbac-legacy-fallback]]
==== Legacy Fallback

Users have existign roles that rely on index privileges to the `.kibana` index. The legacy fallback uses the `callWithRequest` method when the user doesn't have and application privileges. This relies on the user have index privileges on `.kibana`. The legacy fallback will be available until 7.0.

Within the secured instance of the `SavedObjectsClient` the `_has_privileges` check determines if the user has any index privileges on the `.kibana` index:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
POST /_xpack/security/user/_has_privileges
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic foo_legacy_user password

{
   "applications":[
       {
           "application":"kibana-.kibana",
           "resources":["*"],
           "privileges":[
             "action:saved_objects/dashboard/save"
           ]
       }
   ],
   "index": [
       {
           "names": ".kibana",
           "privileges": ["create", "delete", "read", "view_index_metadata"]
       }
   ]
}
----------------------------------

Here is an example response if the user does not have application privileges, but does have privileges on the `.kibana` index:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
{
  "username": "foo_legacy_user",
  "has_all_requested": false,
  "cluster": {},
  "index": {
    ".kibana": {
      "read": true,
      "view_index_metadata": true,
      "create": true,
      "delete": true
    }
  },
  "application": {
    "kibana-.kibana": {
      "*": {
        "action:saved_objects/dashboard/save": false
      }
    }
  }
}
----------------------------------

{kib} automatically detects that the request could be executed against `.kibana` using `callWithRequest` and does so.

When the user first logs into {kib}, if they have no application privileges and will have to rely on the legacy fallback, {kib} logs a deprecation warning similar to the following:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
${username} relies on index privileges on the {kib} index. This is deprecated and will be removed in {kib} 7.0
----------------------------------

[[development-rbac-reserved-roles]]
==== Reserved roles

Ideally, the `kibana_user` and `kibana_dashboard_only_user` roles should only use application privileges, and no longer have index privileges on the `.kibana` index. However, making this switch forces the user to incur downtime if Elasticsearch is upgraded to >= 6.4, and {kib} is running < 6.4. To mitigate this downtime, for the 6.x releases the `kibana_user` and `kibana_dashbord_only_user` roles have both application privileges and index privileges. When {kib} is running >= 6.4 it uses the application privileges to authorize the user, but when {kib} is running < 6.4 {kib} relies on the direct index privileges.
