[[reporting_plugin]]
=== Reporting plugin added new validation for protocol

*Details:* The Reporting plugin added new validation for protocol strings in Network Policy configurations.

*Impact*: See <<reporting-network-policy, Restrict requests with a Reporting network policy>>.
If the kibana.yml has a Reporting network policy before upgrade,
the protocol strings must end with a colon. Otherwise, config validation
will fail and Kibana will not start.

[[glibc_212_unsupported]]
=== Dropped support for glibc 2.12

*Details:* {kib} 7.11.0 upgrades the Node.js runtime to version `14.16.0`. This updated runtime requires glibc `2.16`,
which drops support for glibc `2.12`-based operating systems.

*Impact*: Supported versions of {kib} are not impacted. You can no longer run {kib} on older operating systems that require glibc `2.12` (for example, CentOS 6). Refer to our https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[support matrix] for a list of currently supported operating systems.
