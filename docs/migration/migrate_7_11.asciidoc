[[reporting_plugin]]
=== Reporting plugin added new validation for protocol

*Details:* The Reporting plugin added new validation for protocol strings in Network Policy configurations.

*Impact*: See {kibana-ref}/reporting-network-policy.html[Restrict requests with a Reporting network policy].
If the kibana.yml has a Reporting network policy before upgrade,
the protocol strings must end with a colon. Otherwise, config validation
will fail and Kibana will not start.
