[[breaking_75_search_instead_of-msearch]]
=== The default setting for `courier:batchSearches` is now `false`

*Details:*
Changing the default setting for `courier:batchSearches` to `false` means
that search requests will use the `_search` {es} endpoint rather than `_msearch`.

*Impact:*
Dashboard panels will load individually, and search requests will terminate
when users navigate away or update the query.

[[breaking_75_codeapp]]
=== The experimental Code app has been removed

*Details:*
The experimental Code app that was previously disabled by default has been
removed. Due to the existing implementation of code being untenable, we've
decided not to pursue further development of the code app at this time.

*Impact:*
Any installs that previously enabled the Code app will now log a warning when
Kibana starts up. It's safe to remove all configurations starting with
`xpack.code.`. Starting in 8.0, these warnings will become errors that prevent
Kibana from starting up.
