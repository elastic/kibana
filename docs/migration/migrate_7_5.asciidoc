[[breaking_75_change_default_setting]]
=== The default setting for `courier:batchSearches` is now `false`

*Details:*
Changing the default setting for `courier:batchSearches` to `false` means 
that search requests will use the `_search` {es} endpoint rather than `_msearch`. 

*Impact:*
Dashboard panels will load individually, and search requests will terminate 
when users navigate away or update the query.

[float]
[[breaking_75_telemetry]]
=== `xpack.telemetry.enabled` is no longer valid

*Details:*
The `xpack.telemetry.enabled` setting has been removed.  

*Impact:*
Use {kibana-ref}/monitoring-settings-kb.html#monitoring-general-settings[`telemetry.enabled`] instead.
