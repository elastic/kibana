[[breaking_72_index_pattern_changes]]
=== Index pattern changes 

[float]
==== Time-based internal index patterns queried as wildcard index patterns
*Details:* Time-based interval index patterns were deprecated in 5.x. In 6.x, 
you could no longer create time-based interval index patterns, but they continued 
to function as expected. In 7.2, functionality has changed such that {kib} will 
automatically query a time-based interval index pattern as a wildcard index pattern.
Support for time-based index patterns will be removed in 8.0. You can migrate your 
time-based index patterns to a wildcard pattern to prepare for this change.

*Impact:* If you query a time-based index pattern, that query will now be performed 
on the root wildcard term. For example, a query on an index pattern such as 
`[logstash-]YYYY.MM.DD` will now query all indices that match `logstash-*`.

[float]
[[breaking_72_saved_objects_migration_changes]]
=== Saved object migration changes

[float]
==== New error is thrown when a plugin defines a migration for a mapping it doesn't define or own
*Details:* Kibana will now throw an error on startup if a plugin has defined
a saved object migration inside a plugin that doesn't define or own the mappings to.

*Impact:* If you define migrations within your plugin but the mappings is
owned by another plugin, Kibana will no longer allow that and not start up.
