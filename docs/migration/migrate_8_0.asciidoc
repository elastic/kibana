[[breaking_80_index_pattern_changes]]
=== Index pattern changes

[float]
==== Removed support for time-based internal index patterns
*Details:* Time-based interval index patterns were deprecated in 5.x. In 6.x,
you could no longer create time-based interval index patterns, but they continued
to function as expected. Support for these index patterns has been removed in 8.0.

*Impact:* You must migrate your time_based index patterns to a wildcard pattern,
for example, `logstash-*`.


[float]
[[breaking_80_setting_changes]]
=== Settings changes

// tag::notable-breaking-changes[]
[float]
==== Multitenancy by changing `kibana.index` is no longer supported
*Details:* `kibana.index`, `xpack.reporting.index` and `xpack.task_manager.index` can no longer be specified. 

*Impact:* Users who relied on changing these settings to achieve multitenancy should use *Spaces*, cross-cluster replication, or cross-cluster search instead. To migrate to *Spaces*, users are encouraged to use saved object management to export their saved objects from a tenant into the default tenant in a space. Improvements are planned to improve on this workflow. See https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/82020 for more details.   

[float]
==== Legacy browsers are now rejected by default
*Details:* `csp.strict` is now enabled by default, so Kibana will fail to load for older, legacy browsers that do not enforce basic Content Security Policy protections - notably Internet Explorer 11.

*Impact:* To allow Kibana to function for these legacy browsers, set `csp.strict: false`. Since this is about enforcing a security protocol, we *strongly discourage* disabling `csp.strict` unless it is critical that you support Internet Explorer 11.

[float]
==== Default logging timezone is now the system's timezone
*Details:* In prior releases the timezone used in logs defaulted to UTC. We now use the host machine's timezone by default.

*Impact:* To restore the previous behavior, in kibana.yml use the pattern layout, with a {kibana-ref}/logging-service.html#date-format[date modifier]:
[source,yaml]
-------------------
logging:
  appenders:
    custom:
      type: console
      layout:
        type: pattern
        pattern: "%date{ISO8601_TZ}{UTC}"
-------------------
See https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/90368 for more details.

[float]
==== Responses are never logged by default
*Details:* Previously responses would be logged if either `logging.json` was true, `logging.dest` was specified, or a `TTY` was detected. With the new logging configuration, these are provided by a dedicated logger.

*Impact:* To restore the previous behavior, in `kibana.yml` enable `debug` for the `http.server.response` logger:
[source,yaml]
-------------------
logging:
  appenders:
    custom:
      type: console
      layout:
        type: pattern
  loggers:
    - name: http.server.response
      appenders: [custom]
      level: debug
-------------------
See https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/87939 for more details.

[float]
==== Logging destination is specified by the appender
*Details:* Previously log destination would be `stdout` and could be changed to `file` using `logging.dest`. With the new logging configuration, you can specify the destination using {kibana-ref}/logging-service.html#logging-appenders[appenders]. 

*Impact:* To restore the previous behavior and log records to *stdout*, in `kibana.yml` use an appender with `type: console`.
[source,yaml]
-------------------
logging:
  appenders:
    custom:
      type: console
      layout:
        type: pattern
  root:
    appenders: [default, custom]
-------------------

To send logs to `file` with a given file path, you should define a custom appender with `type:file`:
[source,yaml]
-------------------
logging:
  appenders:
    file:
      type: file
      fileName: /var/log/kibana.log
      layout:
        type: pattern
  root:
    appenders: [default, file]
-------------------

[float]
==== Set log verbosity with root
*Details:* Previously logging output would be specified by `logging.silent` (none), `logging.quiet` (error messages only) and `logging.verbose` (all). With the new logging configuration, set the minimum required {kibana-ref}/logging-service.html#log-level[log level].

*Impact:* To restore the previous behavior, in `kibana.yml` specify `logging.root.level`:
[source,yaml]
-------------------
# suppress all logs
logging:
  root:
    level: off
-------------------

[source,yaml]
-------------------
# only log error messages
logging:
  root:
    level: error
-------------------

[source,yaml]
-------------------
# log all events
logging:
  root:
    level: all
-------------------

[float]
==== Declare log message format
*Details:* Previously all events would be logged in `json` format when `logging.json` was true. With the new logging configuration you can specify the output format with layouts. You can choose between `json` and pattern format depending on your needs.

*Impact:* To restore the previous behavior, in `kibana.yml` configure the logging format for each custom appender with the `appender.layout` property. There is no default for custom appenders and each one must be configured expilictly. 

[source,yaml]
-------------------
logging:
  appenders:
    custom_console:
      type: console
      layout:
        type: pattern
    custom_json:
      type: console
      layout:
        type: json
  loggers:
    - name: plugins.myPlugin
      appenders: [custom_console]
  root:
    appenders: [default, custom_json]
    level: warn
-------------------

[float]
==== Configure log rotation with the rolling-file appender
*Details:* Previously log rotation would be enabled when `logging.rotate.enabled` was true.

*Impact:* To restore the previous behavior, in `kibana.yml` use the {kibana-ref}/logging-service.html#rolling-file-appender[`rolling-file`] appender.

[source,yaml]
-------------------
logging:
  appenders:
    rolling-file:
      type: rolling-file
      fileName: /var/logs/kibana.log
      policy:
        type: size-limit
        size: 50mb
      strategy:
        type: numeric
        pattern: '-%i'
        max: 2
      layout:
        type: pattern
  loggers:
    - name: plugins.myPlugin
      appenders: [rolling-file]
-------------------

[float]
==== `xpack.security.authProviders` is no longer valid
*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.security.authProviders` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has been removed.

*Impact:* Use `xpack.security.authc.providers` instead.

[float]
==== `xpack.security.authc.providers` has changed value format
*Details:* `xpack.security.authc.providers` setting in the `kibana.yml` has changed value format.

*Impact:* Array of provider types as a value is no longer supported, use extended object format instead.

[float]
==== `xpack.security.authc.saml` is no longer valid
*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.security.authc.saml` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has been removed.

*Impact:* Configure SAML authentication providers using `xpack.security.authc.providers.saml.{provider unique name}.*` settings instead.

[float]
==== `xpack.security.authc.oidc` is no longer valid
*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.security.authc.oidc` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has been removed.

*Impact:* Configure OpenID Connect authentication providers using `xpack.security.authc.providers.oidc.{provider unique name}.*` settings instead.

[float]
==== `xpack.security.public` is no longer valid
*Details:* Previously Kibana was choosing the appropriate Elasticsearch SAML realm automatically using the `Assertion Consumer Service`
URL that it derived from the actual server address and `xpack.security.public` setting. Starting in 8.0.0, the deprecated `xpack.security.public` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has been removed and the Elasticsearch SAML realm name that Kibana will use should be specified explicitly.

*Impact:* Define `xpack.security.authc.providers.saml.{provider unique name}.realm` when using the SAML authentication providers instead.

[float]
==== `/api/security/v1/saml` endpoint is no longer supported
*Details:* The deprecated `/api/security/v1/saml` endpoint is no longer supported.

*Impact:* Rely on `/api/security/saml/callback` endpoint when using SAML instead. This change should be reflected in Elasticsearch and Identity Provider SAML settings.

[float]
==== `/api/security/v1/oidc` endpoint is no longer supported
*Details:* The deprecated `/api/security/v1/oidc` endpoint is no longer supported.

*Impact:* Rely on `/api/security/oidc/callback` endpoint when using OpenID Connect instead. This change should be reflected in Elasticsearch and OpenID Connect Provider settings.

[float]
==== `/api/security/v1/oidc` endpoint is no longer supported for Third Party initiated login
*Details:* The deprecated `/api/security/v1/oidc` endpoint is no longer supported for Third Party initiated login.

*Impact:* Rely on `/api/security/oidc/initiate_login` endpoint when using Third Party initiated OpenID Connect login instead. This change should be reflected in Elasticsearch and OpenID Connect Provider settings.

[float]
==== `/api/security/v1/oidc/implicit` endpoint is no longer supported
*Details:* The deprecated `/api/security/v1/oidc/implicit` endpoint is no longer supported.

*Impact:* Rely on `/api/security/oidc/implicit` endpoint when using OpenID Connect Implicit Flow instead. This change should be reflected in OpenID Connect Provider settings.

[float]
=== `optimize` directory is now in the `data` folder
*Details:* Generated bundles have moved to the configured `path.data` folder.

*Impact:* Any workflow that involved manually clearing generated bundles will have to be updated with the new path.

[float]
=== kibana.keystore has moved from the `data` folder to the `config` folder
*Details:* By default, kibana.keystore has moved from the configured `path.data` folder to `<root>/config` for archive distributions
and `/etc/kibana` for package distributions.  If a pre-existing keystore exists in the data directory that path will continue to be used.

[float]
[[breaking_80_user_role_changes]]
=== User role changes

[float]
=== `kibana_user` role has been removed and `kibana_admin` has been added.

*Details:* The `kibana_user` role has been removed and `kibana_admin` has been added to better
reflect its intended use. This role continues to grant all access to every
{kib} feature. If you wish to restrict access to specific features, create
custom roles with {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[{kib} privileges].

*Impact:* Any users currently assigned the `kibana_user` role will need to
instead be assigned the `kibana_admin` role to maintain their current
access level.

[float]
=== `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role has been removed.

*Details:* The `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role has been removed.
If you wish to restrict access to just the Dashboard feature, create
custom roles with {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[{kib} privileges].

*Impact:* Any users currently assigned the `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role will need to be assigned a custom role which only grants access to the Dashboard feature.

Granting additional cluster or index privileges may enable certain
**Stack Monitoring** features.

[float]
[[breaking_80_reporting_changes]]
=== Reporting changes

[float]
==== Legacy job parameters are no longer supported
*Details:* POST URL snippets that were copied in Kibana 6.2 or earlier are no longer supported. These logs have
been deprecated with warnings that have been logged throughout 7.x. Please use Kibana UI to re-generate the
POST URL snippets if you depend on these for automated PDF reports.

[float]
=== Configurations starting with `xpack.telemetry` are no longer valid

*Details:*
The `xpack.` prefix has been removed for all telemetry configurations.

*Impact:*
For any configurations beginning with `xpack.telemetry`, remove the `xpack` prefix. Use {kibana-ref}/telemetry-settings-kbn.html#telemetry-general-settings[`telemetry.enabled`] instead.

[float]
=== SysV init support has been removed

*Details:*
All supported operating systems support using systemd service files.  Any system that doesn't already have service aliased to use kibana.service should use `systemctl start kibana.service` instead of the `service start kibana`.

*Impact:*
Any installations using `.deb` or `.rpm` packages using SysV will need to migrate to systemd.

[float]
=== TLS v1.0 and v1.1 are disabled by default

*Details:*
Support can be re-enabled by setting `--tls-min-1.0` in the `node.options` config file that can be found inside `kibana/config` folder or any other configured with the environment variable `KBN_PATH_CONF` (for example in Debian based system would be `/etc/kibana`).

*Impact:*
Browser and proxy clients communicating over TLS v1.0 and v1.1.

[float]
=== Platform removed from root folder name for `.tar.gz` and `.zip` archives

*Details:*
The output directory after extracting an archive no longer includes the target platform.  For example, `kibana-8.0.0-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` will produce a folder named `kibana-8.0.0`.

*Impact:*
Configuration management tools and automation will need to be updated to use the new directory.
