[float]
=== kibana.yml setting `elasticsearch.url` sets port based on protocol
*Details:* In prior versions of Kibana, if no port was specified in `elasticsearch.url` a default of 9200 was chosen.
The port is now protocol dependent: https ports will use 443, and http ports will use 80.

*Impact:* If your `elasticsearch.url` was dependent on an unspecified port set to 9200, `:9200` will have to be appended to the url.

[float]
=== `optimize` directory is now in the `data` folder
*Details:* Generated bundles have moved to the configured `path.data` folder.

*Impact:* Any workflow that involved manually clearing generated bundles will have to be updated with the new path.
