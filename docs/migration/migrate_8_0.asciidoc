[[breaking_80_index_pattern_changes]]
=== Index pattern changes 

[float]
==== Removed support for time-based internal index patterns
*Details:* Time-based interval index patterns were deprecated in 5.x. In 6.x, 
you could no longer create time-based interval index patterns, but they continued 
to function as expected. Support for these index patterns has been removed in 8.0.

*Impact:* You must migrate your time_based index patterns to a wildcard pattern, 
for example, `logstash-*`. 


[float]
[[breaking_80_setting_changes]]
=== Settings changes

// tag::notable-breaking-changes[]
[float]
==== Default logging timezone is now the system's timezone
*Details:* In prior releases the timezone used in logs defaulted to UTC.  We now use the host machine's timezone by default.

*Impact:* To restore the previous behavior, in kibana.yml set `logging.timezone: UTC`.

[float]
==== `xpack.security.authProviders` is no longer valid
*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.security.authProviders` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has been removed.

*Impact:* Use `xpack.security.authc.providers` instead.

[float]
==== `xpack.security.authc.saml.realm` is now mandatory when using the SAML authentication provider
*Details:* Previously Kibana was choosing the appropriate Elasticsearch SAML realm automatically using the `Assertion Consumer Service`
URL that it derived from the actual server address. Starting in 8.0.0, the Elasticsearch SAML realm name that Kibana will use should be
specified explicitly.

*Impact:* Always define `xpack.security.authc.saml.realm` when using the SAML authentication provider.

[float]
==== `xpack.security.public` is no longer valid
*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.security.public` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has been removed.

*Impact:* Define `xpack.security.authc.saml.realm` when using the SAML authentication provider instead.
