[[breaking_80_index_pattern_changes]]
=== Index pattern changes 

[float]
==== Removed support for time-based internal index patterns
*Details:* Time-based interval index patterns were deprecated in 5.x. In 6.x, 
you could no longer create time-based interval index patterns, but they continued 
to function as expected. Support for these index patterns has been removed in 8.0.

*Impact:* You must migrate your time_based index patterns to a wildcard pattern, 
for example, `logstash-*`.

[[breaking_80_setting_changes]]
=== Settings changes

// tag::notable-breaking-changes[]
[float]
==== Default logging timezone is now the system's timezone
*Details:* In prior releases the timezone used in logs defaulted to UTC.  We now use the host machine's timezone by default.

*Impact:* To restore the previous behavior, in kibana.yml set `logging.timezone: UTC`.
