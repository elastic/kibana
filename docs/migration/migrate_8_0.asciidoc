[[breaking_80_index_pattern_changes]]
=== Index pattern changes 

[float]
==== Removed support for time-based internal index patterns
*Details:* Time-based interval index patterns were deprecated in 5.x. In 6.x, 
you could no longer create time-based interval index patterns, but they continued 
to function as expected. Support for these index patterns has been removed in 8.0.

*Impact:* You must migrate your time_based index patterns to a wildcard pattern, 
for example, `logstash-*`. 


[float]
[[breaking_80_setting_changes]]
=== Settings changes

// tag::notable-breaking-changes[]
[float]
==== Legacy browsers are now rejected by default
*Details:* `csp.strict` is now enabled by default, so Kibana will fail to load for older, legacy browsers that do not enforce basic Content Security Policy protections - notably Internet Explorer 11.

*Impact:* To allow Kibana to function for these legacy browsers, set `csp.strict: false`. Since this is about enforcing a security protocol, we *strongly discourage* disabling `csp.strict` unless it is critical that you support Internet Explorer 11.

[float]
==== Default logging timezone is now the system's timezone
*Details:* In prior releases the timezone used in logs defaulted to UTC.  We now use the host machine's timezone by default.

*Impact:* To restore the previous behavior, in kibana.yml set `logging.timezone: UTC`.

[float]
==== Responses are never logged by default
*Details:* Previously responses would be logged if either `logging.json` was true, `logging.dest` was specified, or a `TTY` was detected.

*Impact:* To restore the previous behavior, in kibana.yml set `logging.events.response=*`.

[float]
==== `xpack.security.authProviders` is no longer valid
*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.security.authProviders` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has been removed.

*Impact:* Use `xpack.security.authc.providers` instead.

[float]
==== `xpack.security.authc.saml.realm` is now mandatory when using the SAML authentication provider
*Details:* Previously Kibana was choosing the appropriate Elasticsearch SAML realm automatically using the `Assertion Consumer Service`
URL that it derived from the actual server address. Starting in 8.0.0, the Elasticsearch SAML realm name that Kibana will use should be
specified explicitly.

*Impact:* Always define `xpack.security.authc.saml.realm` when using the SAML authentication provider.

[float]
==== `xpack.security.public` is no longer valid
*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.security.public` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has been removed.

*Impact:* Define `xpack.security.authc.saml.realm` when using the SAML authentication provider instead.

[float]
==== `/api/security/v1/saml` endpoint is no longer supported
*Details:* The deprecated `/api/security/v1/saml` endpoint is no longer supported. 

*Impact:* Rely on `/api/security/saml/callback` endpoint when using SAML instead. This change should be reflected in Kibana `server.xsrf.whitelist` config as well as in Elasticsearch and Identity Provider SAML settings.

[float]
=== `optimize` directory is now in the `data` folder
*Details:* Generated bundles have moved to the configured `path.data` folder.

*Impact:* Any workflow that involved manually clearing generated bundles will have to be updated with the new path.

[float]
[[breaking_80_user_role_changes]]
=== User role changes

[float]
==== `kibana_user` role has been removed and `kibana_admin` has been added.

*Details:* The `kibana_user` role has been removed and `kibana_admin` has been added to better
reflect its intended use. This role continues to grant all access to every
{kib} feature. If you wish to restrict access to specific features, create
custom roles with {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[{kib} privileges].

*Impact:* Any users currently assigned the `kibana_user` role will need to
instead be assigned the `kibana_admin` role to maintain their current
access level.

[float]
[[breaking_80_reporting_changes]]
=== Reporting changes

[float]
==== Legacy job parameters are no longer supported
*Details:* POST URL snippets that were copied in Kibana 6.2 or below are no longer supported. These logs have
been deprecated with warnings that have been logged throughout 7.x. Please use Kibana UI to re-generate the
POST URL snippets if you depend on these for automated PDF reports.
