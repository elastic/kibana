=== Breaking changes in 5.0

==== Kibana binds to localhost by default
{k4pull}8013[Pull Request 8013]

*Details:* Kibana (like Elasticsearch) now binds to localhost for security purposes instead of 0.0.0.0 (all addresses). Previous binding to 0.0.0.0 also caused issues for Windows users.

*Impact:* If you are running Kibana inside a container/environment that does not allow localhost binding, this will cause Kibana not to start up unless server.host is configured in the kibana.yml to a valid IP address/host, etc..

==== Markdown headers

{k4pull}7855[Pull Request 7855]

*Details:* As part of addressing the security issue https://www.elastic.co/community/security[ESA-2016-03] (CVE-2016-1000220) in the Kibana product, the markdown version has been bumped.

*Impact:* As a result of the fix to ESA-2016-03, there is a slight change in the markdown format for headers.

Previously, headers are defined using `###` followed by the title:

 ###Packetbeat:
    [Dashboard](/#/dashboard/Packetbeat-Dashboard)
    [Web transactions](/#/dashboard/HTTP)

It should now be defined as follows (with a space between ### and the title):

 ### Packetbeat:
     [Dashboard](/#/dashboard/Packetbeat-Dashboard)
     [Web transactions](/#/dashboard/HTTP)

==== Linux package install directories

{k4pull}7308[Pull Request 7308]

*Details:* To align with the Elasticsearch packages, Kibana now installs binaries under `/usr/share/kibana` and configuration files under `/etc/kibana`. Previously they were both located under `/opt/kibana`.

*Impact:* Apart from learning the new location of Kibana binaries and configuration files, you may have to update your automation scripts as needed.

==== The plugin installer now has its own executable

{k4pull}6402[Pull Request 6402]

*Details:* The new installer can be found at `/bin/kibana-plugin`. When installing/removing Kibana plugins, you will now call `kibana-plugin` instead of the main kibana script.

*Impact:* You may have to update your automation scripts.
