== Breaking changes in 5.0

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application to Kibana 5.0.

[float]
=== URL changes for DEB/RPM packages
*Details:* The previous `packages.elastic.co` URL has been altered to `artifacts.elastic.co`.

*Impact:* Ensure you update your repository files before running the upgrade process, or your operating system may not see the new
packages.

[float]
=== Kibana binds to localhost by default
{pull}8013[Pull Request 8013]

*Details:* Kibana (like Elasticsearch) now binds to localhost for security purposes instead of 0.0.0.0 (all addresses). Previous binding to 0.0.0.0 also caused issues for Windows users.

*Impact:* If you are running Kibana inside a container/environment that does not allow localhost binding, this will cause Kibana not to start up unless server.host is configured in the kibana.yml to a valid IP address/host, etc..

[float]
=== Markdown headers

{pull}7855[Pull Request 7855]

*Details:* As part of addressing the security issue https://www.elastic.co/community/security[ESA-2016-03] (CVE-2016-1000220) in the Kibana product, the markdown version has been bumped.

*Impact:* As a result of the fix to ESA-2016-03, there is a slight change in the markdown format for headers.

Previously, headers are defined using `###` followed by the title:

 ###Packetbeat:
    [Dashboard](/#/dashboard/Packetbeat-Dashboard)
    [Web transactions](/#/dashboard/HTTP)

It should now be defined as follows (with a space between ### and the title):

 ### Packetbeat:
     [Dashboard](/#/dashboard/Packetbeat-Dashboard)
     [Web transactions](/#/dashboard/HTTP)

[float]
=== Linux package install directories

{pull}7308[Pull Request 7308]

*Details:* To align with the Elasticsearch packages, Kibana now installs binaries under `/usr/share/kibana` and configuration files under `/etc/kibana`. Previously they were both located under `/opt/kibana`.

*Impact:* Apart from learning the new location of Kibana binaries and configuration files, you may have to update your automation scripts as needed.

[float]
=== The plugin installer now has its own executable

{pull}6402[Pull Request 6402]

*Details:* The new installer can be found at `/bin/kibana-plugin`. When installing/removing Kibana plugins, you will now call `kibana-plugin` instead of the main kibana script.

*Impact:* You may have to update your automation scripts.

[float]
=== Dashboards created before 5.0

*Details:* Loading a 4.x dashboard in Kibana 5.0 results in an internal change
to the dashboard's metadata, which you can persist by saving the dashboard.

*Impact:* This change will not affect the functionality of the dashboard itself,
but you must save the dashboard before using certain features such as X-Pack reporting.

[float]
=== Saved objects with previously deprecated Elasticsearch features

*Details:* Since Kibana 4.3, users have been able to arbitrarily modify filters
via a generic JSON editor. If users took advantage of any deprecated Elasticsearch
features in this way, then they will cause errors in Kibana since they're removed
from Elasticsearch 5.0. Check the Elasticsearch
{ref}/breaking_50_search_changes.html#_deprecated_queries_removed[breaking changes]
documentation for more details.

*Impact*: Discover, Visualize, and Dashboard will error for any saved objects that
are relying on removed Elasticsearch functionality. Users will need to update the
JSON of any affected filters.
