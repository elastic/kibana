== Breaking changes in 7.0

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application to Kibana 7.0.


[float]
=== Removed support for tribe nodes
*Details:* Elasticsearch 7.0 removes the tribe node feature, so Kibana removes it as well.

*Impact:* You must remove any tribe node configurations in Kibana. Consider using <<management-cross-cluster-search>> instead, which does not require kibana.yml configurations in Kibana.


[float]
=== Removed support for running Kibana with a global Node.js installation
*Details:* Previous versions of Kibana would fallback to using a global installation of Node.js if the distribution included with Kibana was not found.
Kibana 7.0 will only use the Node.js distribution included in the package.

*Impact:* There is no expected impact unless Kibana is installed in a non-standard way.
