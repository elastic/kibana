This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application to Kibana 7.0.

* <<breaking_70_setting_changes>>

See also <<release-highlights>> and <<release-notes>>.

[float]
=== Removed support for users relying on direct index privileges to the Kibana index in Elasticsearch
*Details:* With the introduction of Kibana RBAC in 6.4, users no longer require privileges to the Kibana index in Elasticsearch. Instead, users
should be granted <<kibana-privileges>>. Prior to 7.0, when a user that relies upon direct index privileges logs into Kibana, a deprecation warning is logged. If you are using the `kibana_user` or `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role to grant access to Kibana, or a custom role using <<kibana-privileges>>, no changes are required.

*Impact:* You must change any roles which grant access to Kibana using index privileges to instead use <<kibana-privileges>>. Watcher jobs using the Reporting attachment type must be updated as well.

[float]
=== Removed support for tribe nodes
*Details:* Elasticsearch 7.0 removes the tribe node feature, so Kibana removes it as well.

*Impact:* You must remove any tribe node configurations in Kibana. Consider using <<management-cross-cluster-search>> instead, which does not require kibana.yml configurations in Kibana.


[float]
=== Removed support for running Kibana with a global Node.js installation
*Details:* Previous versions of Kibana would fallback to using a global installation of Node.js if the distribution included with Kibana was not found.
Kibana 7.0 will only use the Node.js distribution included in the package.

*Impact:* There is no expected impact unless Kibana is installed in a non-standard way.

[float]
=== Removed support for using PhantomJS browser for screenshots in Reporting
*Details:* Since the first release of Kibana Reporting, PhantomJS was used as
the headless browser to capture screenshots of Kibana dashboards and
visualizations. In that short time, Chromium has started offering a new
headless browser library and the PhantomJS maintainers abandoned their project.
We started planning for a transition in 6.5.0, when we made Chromium the
default option, but allowed users to continue using Phantom with the
`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.type: phantom` setting. In 7.0, that setting
will still exist for compatibility, but the only valid option will be
`chromium`.

*Impact:* Before upgrading to 7.0, if you have `xpack.reporting.capture.browser.type`
set in kibana.yml, make sure it is set to `chromium`.

[NOTE]
============
Reporting 7.0 uses a version of the Chromium headless browser that RHEL 6,
CentOS 6.x, and other old versions of Linux derived from RHEL 6. This change
effectively removes RHEL 6 OS server support from Kibana Reporting. Users with
RHEL 6 must upgrade to RHEL 7 to use Kibana Reporting starting with version
7.0.0 of the Elastic stack.
============

[float]
=== Advanced setting query:queryString:options no longer applies to filters
*Details:* In previous versions of Kibana the Advanced Setting `query:queryString:options` was applied to both queries
and custom filters using the `query_string` query. This could cause errors if a custom filter used options that
conflicted with the Advanced Setting. In 7.0 `query:queryString:options` will no longer be applied to filters so that
users can have full control over their custom filters.

*Impact:* You must ensure that any saved searches with a `query_string` filter aren't relying implicitly on
`query:queryString:options`.

[float]
=== Advanced setting query:queryString:options no longer applies `default_field: *` by default.
*Details:* Elasticsearch removed the ability to create indices with an _all field in 6.0. As a result, a user could end
up with a mix of indices with and without _all fields if they upgraded from an older version of ES. This could lead to
inconsistent highlighting in Discover. To work around this issue we added `default_field: *` to query:queryString:options
to force consistent querying across indices with and without _all. In 7.0 the _all field will be gone from all indices
so we no longer need this workaround.

*Impact:* Since we'll no longer send the `default_field` parameter in Kibana's query_string query, Elasticsearch
will use the index setting instead. The default for the index setting is also `*`, so most users should not be impacted.
If some of your indices have a non-default `default_field` setting, you may want to update it or re-add the parameter
to Kibana's advanced setting.

[float]
=== Deprecated API `/shorten` has been removed
*Details:* The `/shorten` API has been deprecated since 6.5, when it was replaced by the `/api/shorten_url` API.

*Impact:* The '/shorten' API has been removed. Use the '/api/shorten_url' API instead.

[float]
=== Optimization step deferred until server start
*Details:* Prior versions of Kibana would run the optimization step after each plugin installation.  This is now run on server start when necessary.

*Impact:* Users can trigger a standalone optimization after all plugins have been installed with `bin/kibana --optimize` or let the server manage it on startup.

[float]
=== Legacy browsers (namely IE11) will see a security warning message whenever they load Kibana
*Details:* Kibana now has a Content Security Policy, but it's only effective if browsers enforce it, and since older
browsers like Internet Explorer 11 do not support CSP, we show them a warning message whenever they load Kibana.

*Impact:* Nothing needs to be done necessarily, but if you don't need to support legacy browsers like IE11, we recommend
that you set `csp.strict: true` in your kibana.yml to block access to those browsers entirely. If your organization requires
users to use IE11, you might like to disable the warning entirely with `csp.warnLegacyBrowsers: false` in your kibana.yml.

[float]
=== Saved object structure change
*Details:* Saved objects no longer contain ids of other saved objects under `attributes`. They have been moved under `references` with a named reference in `attributes`.

Example structure before:
```
{
  ...
  "attributes": {
    ...
    "panelsJSON": [{
      ...
      "type": "visualization",
      "id": "dbf71bb0-ffad-11e8-acfd-d359b3d9069"
    }]
  }
}
```

Example structure after:
```
{
  ...
  "attributes": {
    ...
    "panelsJSON": [{
      ...
      "panelRefName": "panel_0"
    }]
  },
  "references": [{
    "name": "panel_0",
    "type": "visualization",
    "id": "dbf71bb0-ffad-11e8-acfd-d359b3d9069"
  }]
}
```

*Impact:* Users who query directly for ids will have to use the new `hasReference` in the find API. Users who save ids within attributes will have to move them into the `references` attribute and have a named reference to it.

=== Settings changes

[float]
==== `elasticsearch.ssl.ca` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `elasticsearch.ssl.ca` setting in the `kibana.yml` 
file has been removed.

*Impact:* Use `elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities` instead.

[float]
==== `elasticsearch.ssl.cert` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `elasticsearch.ssl.cert` setting in the `kibana.yml`
file has been removed.

*Impact:* Use `elasticsearch.ssl.certificate` instead.

[float]
==== `elasticsearch.ssl.verify` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `elasticsearch.ssl.verify` setting in the `kibana.yml`
file has been removed.

*Impact:* Use `elasticsearch.ssl.verificationMode` instead. If you set
`elasticsearch.ssl.verify` to `true`, that is equal to setting 
`elasticsearch.ssl.verificationMode` to `full`.

[float]
==== `elasticsearch.url` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `elasticsearch.url` setting in the `kibana.yml` file
has been removed. 

*Impact:* Use `elasticsearch.hosts` instead. In prior versions of Kibana, if no
port was specified in `elasticsearch.url`, a default of 9200 was chosen. The
port in `elasticsearch.hosts` is protocol dependent: https ports will use 443,
and http ports will use 80. If your `elasticsearch.url` setting was dependent on
an unspecified port set to 9200, append `:9200` to the url in the
`elasticsearch.hosts` setting.

[float]
==== `i18n.defaultLocale` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `i18n.defaultLocale` setting in the `kibana.yml` file
has been removed.

*Impact:* Use `i18n.locale` instead.

[float]
==== `index_management.<any setting>` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `index_management.*` settings in the `kibana.yml`
file have been removed.

*Impact:* Use `xpack.index_management.<any setting>` instead.

[float]
==== `license_management.<any setting>` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `license_management.*` settings in the `kibana.yml`
file have been removed.

*Impact:* Use `xpack.license_management.<any setting>` instead.

[float]
==== `logging.useUTC` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `logging.useUTC` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has
been removed. 

*Impact:* If `logging.useUTC` was set to `true` (its default value), the
timezone id was `UTC`. Use `logging.timezone` instead. Any timezone can now be
specified by canonical id. 

[float]
==== `regionmap` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `regionmap` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has been
removed.

*Impact:* Use `map.regionmap` instead.

[float]
==== `rollup.<any setting>` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `rollup.*` settings in the `kibana.yml` file have been
removed.

*Impact:* Use `xpack.rollup.<any setting>` instead.

[float]
==== `server.ssl.cert` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `server.ssl.cert` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has
been removed.

*Impact:* Use `server.ssl.certificate` instead

[float]
==== `server.ssl.enabled` must be set to `true` to enable SSL

*Details:* Previously, if the `server.ssl.certificate` and `server.ssl.key`
settins were specified in the `kibana.yml` file, SSL would be automatically
enabled. It's now required that you set `server.ssl.enabled` to `true` for this
to occur.

*Impact:* Users with both `server.ssl.certificate` and `server.ssl.key` set must
now also set `server.ssl.enabled` to enable SSL.

[float]
==== `server.ssl.supportedProtocols` excludes TLSv1 by default

*Details:* By default, TLSv1 support has been removed. It's still possible to
opt-in to TLSv1 support by explicitly setting `server.ssl.supportedProtocols` in
the `kibana.yml` file.

*Impact:* Users relying on TLSv1 will be unable to use Kibana unless
`server.ssl.supportedProtocols` is explicitly set.

[float]
==== `tilemap` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `tilemap` setting in the `kibana.yml` file has been
removed.

*Impact:* Use `map.tilemap` instead.

[float]
==== `upgrade_assistant.<any setting>` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `upgrade_assistant.*` settings in the `kibana.yml`
file have been removed.

*Impact:* Use `xpack.upgrade_assistant.<any setting>` instead.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.beats.index_pattern` is no longer valid

*Details:* The unsupported `xpack.monitoring.beats.index_pattern` setting in the
`kibana.yml` file has been officially removed.

*Impact:* The ability to customize this pattern is no longer supported.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.cluster_alerts.index` is no longer valid

*Details:* The unsupported `xpack.monitoring.cluster_alerts.index` setting in
the `kibana.yml` file has been officially removed. 

*Impact:* The ability to customize this index is no longer supported.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.index_pattern` is no longer valid

*Details:* The unsupported `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.index_pattern`
setting in the `kibana.yml` file has been officially removed.

*Impact:* The ability to customize this pattern is no longer supported.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.ca` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.ca` setting in the
`kibana.yml` file has been removed. 

*Impact:* Use `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities` instead.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.cert` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.cert` setting in
the `kibana.yml` file has been removed. 

*Impact:* Use `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.certificate` instead.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.verify` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.verify` setting in
the `kibana.yml` file has been removed. 

*Impact:* Use `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.verificationMode` instead. If
you previously set `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.verify` to `true`, it is
equal to setting `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.verificationMode` to `full`.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url` setting in the
`kibana.yml` file has been removed. 

*Impact:* Use `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts` instead. In prior versions
of Kibana, if no port was specified in `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url` a
default of 9200 was chosen. The port in `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts`
is protocol dependent: https ports will use 443, and http ports will use 80. If
`xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url` was dependent on an unspecified port set to
9200, append `:9200` to the url in `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts`.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.index_pattern` is no longer valid

*Details:* The unsupported `xpack.monitoring.index_pattern` setting in the
`kibana.yml` file has been officially removed.

*Impact:* The ability to customize this pattern is no longer supported.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.kibana.index_pattern` is no longer valid

*Details:* The unsupported `xpack.monitoring.kibana.index_pattern` setting in
the `kibana.yml` file has been officially removed.

*Impact:* The ability to customize this pattern is no longer supported.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.logstash.index_pattern` is no longer valid

*Details:* The unsupported `xpack.monitoring.logstash.index_pattern` setting in
the `kibana.yml` file has been officially removed.

*Impact:* The ability to customize this pattern is no longer supported.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.node_resolver` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.monitoring.node_resolver` setting in the
`kibana.yml` file has been removed. This setting has been deprecated since 5.6,
when it was explicitly recommended to use `uuid` as its value.

*Impact:* This setting is no longer necessary. If you enable the {stack}
{monitor-features}, a monitoring agent runs on each Elasticsearch node, Logstash
node, Kibana instance, and Beat to collect and index metrics. Each node and
instance is considered unique based on its persistent UUID, which is written to
the `path.data` directory when the node or instance starts.

[float]
==== `xpack.monitoring.report_stats` is no longer valid

*Details:* The deprecated `xpack.monitoring.report_stats` setting in the
`kibana.yml` file has been removed. 

*Impact:* Use `xpack.xpack_main.telemetry.enabled` instead.
