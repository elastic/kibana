[[breaking_74_search_instead_of-msearch]]
=== Use search instead of msearch when batching is disabled 

*Details:*
When the advanced setting `courier:batchSearches` is disabled, we 
previously sent the search requests as `_msearch` requests.
We now use `_search` when batching is disabled.

*Impact:*
When the advanced setting `courier:batchSearches` is disabled, 
requests from *Discover*, *Visualize*, and *Dashboard* will now query {es} 
using the `_search` endpoint rather than the `_msearch` endpoint.
