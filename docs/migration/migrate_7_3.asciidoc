[[breaking_73_data_frames_date_format]]
=== Removed support for date histogram format specifications in {dataframe-transforms}

*Details:* If your {dataframe-transform} groups your data by using a date
histogram, the `format` property is no longer supported.

*Impact:* {dataframe-transforms-cap} that were created in 7.2 and use date
histograms might no longer work in 7.3. If you run into issues starting a
transform, recreate it by copying the `pivot` part of the configuration into the
advanced editor of the {dataframe-transforms} wizard. The advanced editor will
remove the unsupported attribute once the configuration gets applied.
