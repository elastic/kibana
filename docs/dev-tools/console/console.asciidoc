== Console

Console enables you to interact with the REST API of {es}. *Note:* You cannot 
interact with {kib} API endpoints via Console.

Go to *Dev Tools > Console* to get started. 

Console has two main areas: 

* The *editor*, where you compose requests to send to {es}.
* The *response* pane, which displays the responses to the request.

[[console-api]]
=== Writing requests

Console understands commands in a cURL-like syntax. 
For example, the following is a `GET` request to the {es} `_search` API. 

[source,js]
----------------------------------
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
----------------------------------

Here is the equivalent command in cURL:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/_search" -d'
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}'
----------------------------------

If you paste the above command into Console, {kib} automatically converts it
to Console syntax.  Alternatively, if you want to want to see Console syntax in cURL, 
click the action icon (image:dev-tools/console/images/wrench.png[]) and select *Copy as cURL*. 

For help with formatting requests, you can use Console's <<auto-formatting, auto formatting>> 
feature.

[[console-request]]
=== Submitting requests 

Once you enter a command in the editor, click the 
green triangle to submit the request to {es}.

You can select multiple requests and submit them together.
Console sends the requests to {es} one by one and shows the output 
in the response pane. Submitting multiple request is helpful when you're debugging an issue or trying query 
combinations in multiple scenarios.

[float]
[[console-autocomplete]]
=== Using autocomplete

When typing a command, Console makes context-sensitive suggestions.
These suggestions can help you explore parameters for each API and speed up typing. 
To configure your preferences for autocomplete, go to 
<<configuring-console, Settings>>. 

[float]
[[console-view-api]]
=== Viewing API docs

You can view the documentation for an API endpoint by clicking
the action icon (image:dev-tools/console/images/wrench.png[]) and selecting
*Open documentation*.

[float]
[[console-history]]
=== Getting your request history

Console maintains a list of the last 500 requests that {es} successfully executed. 
To view your most recent requests, click *History*. If you select a request
and click *Apply*, {kib} adds it to the editor at the current cursor position.
