== Console

Console enables you to interact with the REST API of {es}. You can:

* Send requests to {es} and view the responses
* View API documentation
* Get your request history

To get started, go to *Dev Tools > Console*.

[[console-api]]
=== Write requests

Console understands commands in a cURL-like syntax. 
For example, the following is a `GET` request to the {es} `_search` API. 

[source,js]
----------------------------------
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
----------------------------------

Here is the equivalent command in cURL:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/_search" -d'
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}'
----------------------------------

If you paste the above command into Console, {kib} automatically converts it
to Console syntax.  Alternatively, if you want to want to see Console syntax in cURL, 
click the action icon (image:dev-tools/console/images/wrench.png[]) and select *Copy as cURL*.

[[console-autocomplete]]
==== Autocomplete

When you're typing a command, Console makes context-sensitive suggestions.
These suggestions show you the parameters for each API and speed up your typing. 
To configure your preferences for autocomplete, go to 
<<configuring-console, Settings>>.

[[auto-formatting]]
==== Auto-formatting
The auto-formatting 
capability can help you format requests. Select one or more requests that you
want to format, click the action icon (image:dev-tools/console/images/wrench.png[]),
and then select *Auto indent*.

For example, you might have a request formatted like this:

[role="screenshot"]
image::dev-tools/console/images/copy-curl.png["Console close-up"]

Console adjusts the JSON body of the request to apply the indents. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::dev-tools/console/images/request.png["Console close-up"]

If you select *Auto indent* on a request that is already well formatted, 
Console collapses the request body to a single line per document. 
This is helpful when working with the {es} {ref}/docs-bulk.html[bulk APIs].



[float]
[[console-request]]
=== Submit requests 

When you're ready to submit the request to {es}, click the 
green triangle.

You can select multiple requests and submit them together.
Console sends the requests to {es} one by one and shows the output 
in the response pane. Submitting multiple request is helpful when you're debugging an issue or trying query 
combinations in multiple scenarios.


[float]
[[console-view-api]]
=== View API docs

To view the documentation for an API endpoint, click
the action icon (image:dev-tools/console/images/wrench.png[]) and select
*Open documentation*.

[float]
[[console-history]]
=== Get your request history

Console maintains a list of the last 500 requests that {es} successfully executed. 
To view your most recent requests, click *History*. If you select a request
and click *Apply*, {kib} adds it to the editor at the current cursor position.

[float]
[[configuring-console]]
=== Configure Console settings

You can configure the Console font size, JSON syntax, 
and autocomplete suggestions in *Settings*.

[[keyboard-shortcuts]]
=== Get keyboard shortcuts

For a list of available keyboard
shortcuts, click *Help*.

[float]
[[console-settings]]
=== Disable Console

If you donâ€™t want to use Console, you can disable it by setting `console.enabled` 
to `false` in your `kibana.yml` configuration file. Changing this setting 
causes the server to regenerate assets on the next startup, 
which might cause a delay before pages start being served.
