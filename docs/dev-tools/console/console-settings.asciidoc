== Disable Console

If you donâ€™t want to use *Console*, you can disable it by setting `console.ui.enabled`
to `false` in your `kibana.yml` configuration file. Changing this setting
causes the server to regenerate assets on the next startup,
which might cause a delay before pages start being served.
