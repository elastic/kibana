=== Auto formatting

Console can help you format requests. Select one or more requests that you
want to format, click the action icon (image:dev-tools/console/images/wrench.png[]),
and select *Auto indent*.

For example, you might have a request that is formatted like this:

[role="screenshot"]
image::dev-tools/console/images/copy-curl.png["Console close-up"]

Console adjusts the JSON body of the request to apply the indents. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::dev-tools/console/images/request.png["Console close-up"]

If you select *Auto indent* on a request that is already well formatted, 
Console collapses the request body to a single line per document. 
This is helpful when working with {es}'s {ref}/docs-bulk.html[bulk APIs].
