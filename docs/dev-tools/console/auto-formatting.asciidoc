=== Auto formatting

Console allows you to auto format messy requests. To do so, position the cursor 
on the request you would like to format and select *Auto indent* from the action menu.

Console will adjust the JSON body of the request to apply the indents.

If you select *Auto indent* on a request that is already perfectly formatted, 
Console will collapse the request body to a single line per document. 
This is very handy when working with {es}'s {ref}/docs-bulk.html[bulk APIs].
