== Submit requests

When you're ready to submit the request to {es}, click the
green triangle.

You can select multiple requests and submit them together.
*Console* sends the requests to {es} one by one and shows the output
in the response pane. Submitting multiple requests is helpful
when you're debugging an issue or trying query
combinations in multiple scenarios.
