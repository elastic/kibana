==== Disabling Console

If you donâ€™t want to use Console, you can disable it by setting `console.enabled` 
to false in your `kibana.yml` configuration file. Changing this setting 
causes the server to regenerate assets on the next startup, 
which might cause a delay before pages start being served.
