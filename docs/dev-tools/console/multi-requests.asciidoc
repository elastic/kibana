=== Multiple Requests Support

The Console editor allows writing multiple requests below each other. As shown in the <<console-kibana>> section, you
can submit a request to Elasticsearch by positioning the cursor and using the <<action_menu,Action Menu>>. Similarly
you can select multiple requests in one go:

.Selecting Multiple Requests

Console will send the request one by one to Elasticsearch and show the output on the right pane as Elasticsearch responds.
This is very handy when debugging an issue or trying query combinations in multiple scenarios.

Selecting multiple requests also allows you to auto format and copy them as cURL in one go.
