= Profiling your Queries and Aggregations

[partintro]

Elasticsearch has a powerful profiler API which can be used to inspect and analyze
your search queries.  The response, however, is a very large JSON blob which is
difficult to analyze by hand.

{xpack} includes the Search Profiler tool which can transform this JSON output
into a visualization that is easy to navigate, allowing you to diagnose and debug
poorly performing queries much faster.
