=== Index and Type filtering

By default, all queries executed by the Search Profiler are sent
to `GET /_search`. It searches across your entire cluster (all indices, all types).

If you need to query a specific index or type (or several), you can use the Index
and Type filters at the top-left of the UI

In the following example, the query is executed against the indices `my_index` and `my_index1`
 and the type `my_type`:

This is equivalent to `GET /my_index,my_index2/my_type/_search`.
