=== Profiling a more complicated query

To understand how the query trees are displayed inside the Search Profiler,
let's look at a more complicated query.

. Index the following data:
+
--
[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST test/test/_bulk
{"index":{}}
{"name":"aaron","age":23,"hair":"brown"}
{"index":{}}
{"name":"sue","age":19,"hair":"red"}
{"index":{}}
{"name":"sally","age":19,"hair":"blonde"}
{"index":{}}
{"name":"george","age":19,"hair":"blonde"}
{"index":{}}
{"name":"fred","age":69,"hair":"blonde"}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
--

. Enter "test" in the Index filter above the query editor (the input box with a
  grayed-out `_all`).  This restricts profiled queries to the `test` index.

. Replace the default `match_all` query with a query that has two sub-query
components and includes a simple aggregation. For example, copy and paste
the following query into the query editor.
+
--
[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   "query": {
      "bool": {
         "should": [
            {
               "match": {
                  "name": "fred"
               }
            },
            {
               "terms": {
                  "name": [
                      "sue",
                      "sally"
                  ]
               }
            }
         ]
      }
   },
   "aggs": {
      "stats": {
         "stats": {
            "field": "price"
         }
      }
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

. Click *Profile* to profile the query and visualize the results.

As before, you'll see a list of shards appear in the center panel.  You'll notice
that the query was slightly slower (15ms vs 0.13ms) because it actually had to do
a bit of work this time, unlike the `match_all` query.
--

. Click the first shard's Expand button to view the query details.

You'll notice several interesting things in the results.  The shard details
contain a row for each query component:

 - The top-level `BooleanQuery` component corresponds to the bool in the query.
 - The second `BooleanQuery` corresponds to the terms query, which is internally
 converted to a `Boolean` of should clauses. It has two child queries that correspond
 to "sue" and "sally" from the terms query.
 - The `TermQuery` that's labeled with _"name:fred"_ corresponds to match: fred in the query.

If you look at the timings, you can see that "Self Time" and "Total Time" are no longer
identical on all the rows.  Self time represents how long the query component took to execute.
Total time is the time a query component _and all its children_ took to execute.
Therefore, queries like the Boolean queries often have larger Total than Self.

In particular, you can see that the `BooleanQuery` for "name:sue name:sally" took 3.8ms total,
but 2.8ms of that was "self" time.  That means 2.8ms was spent by the `BooleanQuery` itself, processing
the should clauses


==== Aggregations

This particular query also includes a aggregation (a `stats` agg on the `"age"` field).
To view Aggregation profiling statistics, click the *Aggregation Profile* tab. This tab
is only enabled if the query being profiled contains an aggregation.

Click a shard's Expand button to view the aggregation details. Hover over an
aggregation row to view the timing breakdown.
