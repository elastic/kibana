The Search Profiler is automatically enabled in {kib}.  It is located under the
*Dev Tools* tab in {kib}. 

[[first-profile]]
To start profiling queries:

. Open Kibana in your web browser and log in. If you are running Kibana
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`.

. Click **DevTools** in the side navigation to open the Search Profiler.
Console is the default tool to open when first accessing DevTools.

On the top navigation bar, click the second item: *Search Profiler*
+

. This opens the Search Profiler interface.

. Replace the default `match_all` query with the query you want to profile and click *Profile*.

+
Search Profiler displays the names of the indices searched, the shards in each index,
and how long the query took.  The following example shows the results of profiling
the match_all query. Three indices were searched: `.monitoring-kibana-2-2016.11.30`,
`.monitoring-data-2` and `test`.
+
If we take a closer look at the information for the test index, we can see from the
Cumulative Time that the query took 0.132ms to execute. Of the five shards in the
index (`DWZD0iosQNeJMTvb4q1JDw` 0 through 5), shard 3 was the slowest (0.053ms), followed by shard 2 (0.038ms). Shards are
sorted by their time in descending order.

[NOTE]
====
The Cumulative Time metric is the sum of individual shard times.
It is not necessarily the actual time it took for the query to return (wall clock time).
Because shards might be processed in parallel on multiple nodes, the wall clock time can
be significantly less than the Cumulative Time. However, if shards are colocated on the
same node and executed serially, the wall clock time is closer to the Cumulative Time.

While the Cumulative Time metric is useful for comparing the performance of your
indices and shards, it doesn't necessarily represent the actual physical query times.

. To view more detailed profiling information for a shard, click the Expand button.
This displays details about the query component(s) that ran on the shard.
+
In this example, there is a single `"MatchAllDocsQuery"` that ran on the shard.
Since it was the only query run, it took 100% of the time.  When you mouse over
a row, the Search Profiler displays additional information about the query component."
