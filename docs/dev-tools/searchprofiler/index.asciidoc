== Profiling queries and aggregations

{es} has a powerful {ref}/search-profile.html[Profile API] which can be used to inspect and analyze
your search queries. The response returns a large JSON blob, which can be
difficult to analyze manually.

The {searchprofiler} tool can transform this JSON output
into a visualization that is easy to navigate, allowing you to diagnose and debug
poorly performing queries much faster.
