=== Rendering pre-captured profiler JSON

The Search Profiler queries the cluster that the Kibana node is attached to.
It does this by executing the query against the cluster and collecting the results.

This is convenient, but sometimes performance problems are temporal in nature. For example,
a query might only be slow at certain time of day when many customers are using your system.
You can setup a process to automatically profile slow queries when they occur and then
save those profile responses for later analysis.

The Search Profiler supports this workflow by enabling you to paste the
pre-captured JSON.  The tool will detect that this is a profiler response JSON
rather than a query, and render the visualization rather than querying the cluster.

To see how this works, copy and paste the following profile response into the
query editor and click *Profile*:
