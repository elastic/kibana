=== Rendering pre-captured profiler JSON

The {searchprofiler} queries the cluster that the Kibana node is attached to.
It does this by executing the query against the cluster and collecting the results.

But sometimes you may want to investigate performance problems that are temporal in nature. 
For example, a query might only be slow at certain time of day when many customers are using your system.
You can setup a process to automatically profile slow queries when they occur and then
save those profile responses for later analysis.

The {searchprofiler} supports this workflow by allowing you to paste the
pre-captured JSON in the query editor.  The {searchprofiler} will detect that you 
have entered a JSON response (rather than a query) and will just render the visualization,
rather than querying the cluster.

To see how this works, copy and paste the following profile response into the
query editor and click *Profile*.
