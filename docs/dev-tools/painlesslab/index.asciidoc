== Painless Lab

beta::[]

The Painless Lab is an interactive code editor that lets you test and
debug {ref}/modules-scripting-painless.html[Painless scripts] in real-time.
You can use the Painless scripting
language to create <<scripted-fields, {kib} scripted fields>>,
process {ref}/docs-reindex.html[reindexed data], define complex
<<watcher-create-advanced-watch, Watcher conditions>>,
and work with data in other contexts.

To get started, open the menu, go to *Dev Tools*, then click *Painless Lab*.
