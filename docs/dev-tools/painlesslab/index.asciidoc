== Painless Lab

beta::[]

The Painless Lab is an interactive code editor that lets you test and
debug Painless scripts in real-time. You can use the Painless scripting
language to create {kib} scripted fields,
process reindexed data, define complex Watcher conditions,
and work with data in other contexts.

To get started, go to *Dev Tools > Painless Lab*.
