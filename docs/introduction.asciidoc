== Introduction

Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to
search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis
and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps.

Kibana makes it easy to understand large volumes of data. Its simple, browser-based interface enables you to quickly
create and share dynamic dashboards that display changes to Elasticsearch queries in real time.

Setting up Kibana is a snap. You can install Kibana and start exploring your Elasticsearch indices in minutes -- no
code, no additional infrastructure required.
