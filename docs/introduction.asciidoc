== Introduction

Sense is handy console for interacting with the REST API of Elasticsearch. As you can see bellow, Sense is composed of
two main panes. The left pane, named the editor, is where you type the requests you will submit to Elasticsearch.
The responses from Elasticsearch are shown on the right hand panel.

Sense understands commands in a cURL-like syntax. For example the following Sense command

[source,js]
----------------------------------
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
----------------------------------

is a simple `GET` request to Elasticsearch's `_search API`. Here is the equivalent command in cURL.


[source,bash]
----------------------------------
curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/_search" -d'
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}'
----------------------------------


In fact, you can paste the above command into Sense and it will automatically be converted into the Sense syntax.

When typing a command, Sense will make context sensitive <<suggestions,suggestions>. You can use those to find out
what are the possible parameters to each API or to just speed up typing. Sense will suggest APIs, indexes and field
names.

Once you have typed a command in to the left pane, you can submit it to Elasticsearch by clicking the little green
triangle that appears next to the url line of the request. Notice that as you move the cursor around, the little
 triangle and wrench icons follow you around. We call this the <<action_menu,Action Menu>>. You can also select
 multiple requests and submit them all at once.

When the response come back, you should see it in the left hand panel:

Sense allows you to easily switch between Elasticsearch instances. By default it will connect to `localhost:9200`
but you can easily change this by entering a different url in the Server input:

This pretty much covers the basics. To follow up, read the <<installing, installation instructions>> or dive deeper
into the <<sense-ui,UI>>.
