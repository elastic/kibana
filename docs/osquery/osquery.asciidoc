[[osquery]]
= Osquery

*Osquery* enables you to search, analyze, and visualize Osquery data ingested in {es}.

You can:

 * Run live queries with one or more agents
 * Schedule queries to capture changes to OS state over time
 * View a history of past queries and their results

For example, use *Osquery* to centralize security analytics and
contextualize OSquery results against other event data, anomalies, and threats,
and then use that context to improve host visibility, analytical power, and monitoring.

== Requirements

* You must have the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-osquery.html[Osquery Manager integration].
This integration supports x86_64 bit Windows, Darwin, Arm64, and Linux platforms.
* Your system has an agent in Fleet.
* Osquery Manager has one or more policies. For more information, refer to the Fleet documentation.
* You have the xxxx permission

[float]
[[osquery-open]]
== Open Osquery

Once you add the Osquery Manager integration to an agent policy, open *Osquery*
and begin your exploring your data.

. Open the main menu, and then click *Osquery*.
. View the queries that have run.
. To replay a query, click image:images/play-icon.png[Right-pointing triangle].
. To view the query <<osquery-results,results>> and <<osquery-status,status>>,
click image:images/table-icon.png[Table icon].

[float]
[[osquery-run-query]]
==  Run live queries

Run a query against one or more agents or policies
and view the results. This is useful for testing your query and
troubleshooting problems.

. In the *Live queries* view, click **New live query**.
. Select one or more agents or groups to query. Start typing in the search field,
and you'll get suggestions for agents by name, ID, platform, or policy.
. Enter a query or select a query from your saved queries.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/enter-query.png[Select saved query dropdown name showing query name and description]
. Click **Submit**.
. Review the results in a table, or navigate to *Discover* to dive deeper into the response
or to *Lens* to build visualizations.
. To view more information about the request, for example, if there are any failures, open the *Status* tab.
. When your query captures the data you want, click *Save for later* and define the ID,
description, and other
<<osquery-manage-query,details>>.


[float]
[[osquery-schedule-query]]
== Schedule queries

Group and schedule queries to run on a specified interval, in seconds.
For example, you might create a group that checks
for IT compliance-type issues and
another group that monitors for evidence of malware.

. Open the **Scheduled query groups** tab.

. Click a group to view its details.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/schedule-query.png[Each query has a name, id, query, platform, and min osquery version]

. Click *Edit* to make changes.
.. To add a query to the group, click *Add query*, and then enter the query ID and interval.
Optionally, set the minimum osquery version and platform.
.. To upload queries from a .conf query pack, drag the pack to drop zone under the query table. To explore the community packs that Osquery publishes, click *Example packs*.
. Click *Save query*. The queries run once the policy receives the update.

[float]
[[osquery-manage-query]]
== Manage your saved queries

View, run, and edit your saved queries on the *Saved queries* tab.
Queries have the following information:

* A unique identifier.
* A brief description.
* The SQL query.
* The scheduled query group. This information is included when you
add the query to a scheduled query group
** The frequency at which at which to run the query.
** The minimum https://github.com/osquery/osquery/releases)[version of osquery] required to run the query.
** The operating system required to run the query. For information about supported platforms, click the *OSquery schema* link on the *Edit query* flyout.

[float]
[[osquery-status]]
== Osquery status

A query can have the following status:

[cols="2*<"]
|===
| Successful | The query completed as expected.
| Failed | The query encountered a problem and might have failed, because there was an issue with the query or the agent was disconnected.
| Not yet responded | The query has not been sent to the agent.
| Expired | The action request timed out. The agent may be offline.
|===

NOTE: If an agent is offline, the request status remains **pending** as {kib} retries the request.
By default, a query request times out after 5 minutes. The time out applies to the time it takes
to deliver the action request to an agent to run a query. If the action completes after the timeout period,
the results are still returned.


[float]
[[osquery-results]]
== Osquery results

Osquery responses include the following information:

* Everything prefaced with `osquery.` is part of the query response. These fields are not mapped to ECS.
* The `host.*` and `agent.*` fields are mapped to ECS.
* The `action_data.query` has the query that was sent.
* All query results are https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/logging/#snapshot-logs[snapshot logs]
that represent a point in time with a set of results, with no differentials.
https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/logging/#differential-logs[Differential logs] are not supported.
* Osquery data is stored in the `logs-osquery_manager.result-default` datastream, and the result row data is under the `osquery` property in the document.

This example shows a successful osquery result.

[float]
== Upgrade osquery versions

The https://github.com/osquery/osquery/releases[osquery version] available on an Elastic Agent
is tied to the version of Osquery Beat on the Agent.
To get the latest version of Osquery Beat,
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/master/upgrade-elastic-agent.html[upgrade your Elastic Agent].

[float]
== Debug issues
If you encounter issues using Osquery Manager, find the relevant logs for the elastic-agent
and Osquerybeat in the installed agent directory, which will look similar to the following example paths.
Adjust the agent path as needed for your setup.

```ts
`/data/elastic-agent-054e22/logs/elastic-agent-json.log-*`
`/data/elastic-agent-054e22/logs/default/osquerybeat-json.log`
```

To get more details in the logs, change the agent logging level to debug:

. Open the main menu, and then select **Fleet**.
. Select the agent that you want to debug.
. On the **Logs** tab, change the **Agent logging level** to **debug**, and then click **Apply changes**.
+
This updates `agent.logging.level` in the `fleet.yml` file and sets the logging level to `debug`.
