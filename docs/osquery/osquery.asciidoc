[[osquery]]
= Osquery

[partintro]
--
https://osquery.io[Osquery] is an open source tool that lets you query operating systems like a database, providing you with visibility into your infrastructure and operating systems.
Using basic SQL commands, you can ask questions about devices, such as servers,
Docker containers, and computers running Linux, macOS, or Windows.
The https://osquery.io/schema[extensive schema] helps with a variety of use cases,
including vulnerability detection, compliance monitoring, incident investigations, and more.

With Osquery in {kib}, you can:

 * Run live queries for one or more agents
 * Schedule query packs to capture changes to OS state over time
 * View a history of past queries and their results
 * Save queries and build a library of queries for specific use cases

Osquery in {kib} is powered by the *Osquery Manager* integration.
For information on how to set up *Osquery Manager*, refer to <<manage-osquery-integration>>.

[float]
== Required privileges

To use *Osquery Manager*, you must be assigned to a role with the following privileges:

* `Read` privileges for the `logs-osquery_manager.result*` index.
* {kib} privileges for **Osquery Manager**. The `All` privilege
enables you to run, schedule, and save queries. `Read` enables you to
view live and scheduled query results, but you cannot run live queries or edit.

[float]
[[osquery-run-query]]
==  Run live queries

To inspect hosts, run a query against one or more agents or policies,
then view the results.

. Open the main menu, and then click *Osquery*.

. In the *Live queries* view, click **New live query**.

. Select one or more agents or groups to query. Start typing in the search field,
and you'll get suggestions for agents by name, ID, platform, and policy.

. Enter a query or select a query from your saved queries.

. (Optional) Expand the **Advanced** section to view or set <<osquery-map-fields,mapped ECS fields>> included in the results from the live query.

. Click **Submit**.

. Review the results in a table, or navigate to *Discover* to dive deeper into the response,
or to the drag-and-drop *Lens* editor to create visualizations.
. To view more information about the request, such as failures, open the *Status* tab.
. To save the query for future use, click *Save for later* and define the ID,
description, and other <<osquery-manage-query,details>>.

[float]
[[osquery-view-history]]
== View or rerun previous live queries

From the *Live queries history* section on the *Live queries* tab:

* Click image:images/play-icon.png[Right-pointing triangle] to replay a query.

* Click image:images/table-icon.png[Table icon] to view the query <<osquery-results,results>> and <<osquery-status,status>>.

[float]
[[osquery-schedule-query]]
== Schedule queries with packs

Create packs to organize sets of queries. For example, you might create one pack that checks
for IT compliance-type issues, and another pack that monitors for evidence of malware.
You can schedule packs to run for one or more agent policies. When scheduled, queries in the pack are run at the set intervals for all agents in those policies. Scheduling packs is optional.

. Open the **Packs** tab.

. Click **Add pack** to create a new pack, or click the name of an existing pack, then **Edit** to add queries to an existing pack.

. Provide the following fields:

* The name of the pack.

* A short description of the pack.

* The agent policies where this pack should run. If no agent policies are set, then the pack is not scheduled.

. Add queries to schedule:

* To add a query to the pack, click *Add query*, and then either add a saved query or enter a new query.
Each query must include a unique query ID and the interval at which it should run.
Optionally, set the minimum Osquery version and platform,
or <<osquery-map-fields,map ECS fields>>. When you add a saved query to a pack, this adds a copy of the query. A connection is not maintained between saved queries and packs.

* To upload queries from a `.conf` query pack, drag the pack to the drop zone under the query table. To explore the community packs that Osquery publishes, click *Example packs*.

. Click *Save pack*. The queries run when the policy receives the update.

[float]
[[osquery-schedule-status]]
== View status of scheduled packs

. Open the **Packs** tab.

. Click a pack name to view the status.
+
Details include the last time each query ran, how many results were returned, and the number of agents the query ran against.
If there are errors, expand the row to view the details, including an option to view more information in the Logs.

. View scheduled query results in <<discover,*Discover*>> or the drag-and-drop <<lens,*Lens*>> editor.

[float]
[[osquery-prebuilt-packs]]
== Prebuilt Elastic packs

The Osquery Manager integration includes a set of prebuilt Osquery packs that you can optionally load. Once added, you can then activate and schedule the packs. 

You can modify the scheduled agent policies for a prebuilt pack, but you cannot edit queries in the pack. To edit the queries, you must first create a copy of the pack.

[float]
[[load-prebuilt-packs]]
=== Load and activate prebuilt Elastic packs

. Go to *Packs*, and then click *Load Elastic prebuilt packs*.

NOTE: This option is only available if new or updated prebuilt packs are available.

. For each pack that you want to schedule: 

* Enable the option to make the pack *Active*.

* Click the pack name, then *Edit*.

* Update the *Scheduled agent policies* to specify the policies where this pack should run.

. Click *Update pack*.

[float]
[[copy-prebuilt-packs]]
=== Copy prebuilt Elastic packs

To modify queries in prebuilt packs, you must first make a copy of the pack.

. Go to *Stack Management* -> *Saved Objects*.

. Search for the Osquery packs you want to modify.

. Select the checkboxes of the packs to export.

. Click *Export x objects*.

. Then click *Import* to import the exported pack. This creates a copy that you can edit.


[float]
[[osquery-manage-query]]
== Save queries

You can save queries in two ways:

* After running a live query, click the *Save for later* link.
* From the *Saved queries* tab, click the **Add saved query** button.

Once you save a query, you can only edit it from the *Saved queries* tab.

To add or edit saved queries from the *Saved queries* tab:

. Go to *Saved queries*, and then click **Add saved query** or the edit icon.
. Provide the following fields:

* The unique identifier.

* A brief description.

* The SQL query.

* The <<osquery-map-fields,ECS fields>> to populate when the query is run. These fields are also copied in when you add this query to a pack.

* The defaults to set when you add the query to a pack.

** The frequency to run the query.

** The minimum https://github.com/osquery/osquery/releases)[version of Osquery] required to run the query.

** The operating system required to run the query. For information about supported platforms per table, refer to the https://osquery.io/schema[Osquery schema].

. Click *Test configuration* to test the query and any mapped fields:

* From the *Test query* panel, select agents or groups to test the query, then click *Submit* to run a live query. Result columns with the image:images/mapped-icon.png[mapping] icon are mapped. Hover over the icon to see the mapped ECS field.

. Click *Save* or *Update*.


[float]
[[osquery-map-fields]]
== Map result fields to ECS

When you save queries or add queries to a pack, you can optionally map Osquery results or static values to fields in
the {ecs-ref}/ecs-reference.html[Elastic Common Schema] (ECS).
This standardizes your Osquery data for use across detections, machine learning,
and any other areas that rely on ECS-compliant data.
When the query is run, the results include the original `osquery.<fields>`
and the mapped ECS fields. For example, if you update a query to map `osquery.name` to `user.name`, the query results include both fields.

. Edit saved queries or queries in a pack to map fields:

* For *Saved queries*: Open the *Saved queries* tab, and then click the edit icon for the query that you want to map.

* For *packs*: Open the *Packs* tab, edit a pack, and then click the edit icon for the query that you want to map.

. In the **ECS mapping** section, select an **ECS field** to map.

. In the **Value** column, use the dropdown on the left to choose what type of value to map to the ECS field:

** **Osquery value**: Select an Osquery field. The fields available are based on the SQL query entered, and only include fields that the query returns. When the query runs, the ECS field is set dynamically to the value of the Osquery field selected.

** **Static value**: Enter a static value. When the query runs, the ECS field is set to the value entered. For example, static fields can be used to apply `tags` or your preferred `event.category` to the query results.

. Map more fields, as needed. To remove any mapped rows, click the delete icon.

. Save your changes.

[NOTE]
=========================

* Some ECS fields are restricted and cannot be mapped. These are not available in the ECS dropdown.

* Some ECS fields are restricted to a set of allowed values, like {ecs-ref}/ecs-event.html#field-event-category[event.category]. Use the {ecs-ref}/ecs-field-reference.html[ECS Field Reference] for help when mapping fields.

* Osquery date fields have a variety of data types (including integer, text, or bigint). When mapping an Osquery date field to an ECS date field, you might need to use SQL operators in the query to get an {es}-compatible
{ref}/date.html[date] type.
=========================


[float]
[[osquery-extended-tables]]
== Extended tables for Kubernetes queries
In addition to the Osquery schema, the Elastic-provided version of Osquery also includes the following tables to support Kubernetes containers. These can be queried with live or scheduled queries.

* `host_users`

* `host_groups`

* `host_processes`

When querying these tables, the expectation is that the `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, and `/proc` are available in the container under `/hostfs` as:
`/hostfs/etc/passwd`, `/hostfs/etc/group`, and `/hostfs/proc`. For information about the fields available in these tables, see the
https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/osquery_manager#exported-fields[exported fields] reference.

[float]
[[osquery-status]]
== Osquery status

A query can have the following status:

[cols="2*<"]
|===
| Successful | The query successfully completed.
| Failed | The query encountered a problem, such as an issue with the query or the agent was disconnected, and might have failed.
| Not yet responded | The query has not been sent to the agent.
| Expired | The action request timed out. The agent may be offline.
|===

NOTE: If an agent is offline, the request status remains **pending** as {kib} retries the request.
By default, a query request times out after five minutes. The time out applies to the time it takes
to deliver the action request to an agent to run a query. If the action completes after the timeout period,
the results are still returned.


[float]
[[osquery-results]]
== Osquery results
When you run live or scheduled queries, the results are automatically
stored in an {es} index, so that you can search, analyze, and visualize this data in {kib}.
For a list of the Osquery fields that can be returned in query results,
refer to https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/osquery_manager#exported-fields[exported fields].
Query results can also include ECS fields, if the query has a defined ECS mapping.

Osquery responses include the following information:

* Everything prefaced with `osquery.` is part of the query response. These fields are not mapped to ECS by default.

* Results include some ECS fields by default, such as `host.*` and `agent.*`, which provide information about the host that was queried.

* For live queries, the `action_data.query` is the query that was sent.

* For scheduled queries in a pack, the `action_id` has the format `pack_<pack-name>_<query-ID>`. You can use this information to look up the query that was run.

* By default, all query results are https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/logging/#snapshot-logs[snapshot logs]
that represent a point in time with a set of results, with no
https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/logging/#differential-logs[differentials].

* Osquery data is stored in the `logs-osquery_manager.result-<namespace>` datastream, and the result row data is under the `osquery` property in the document.
