[[osquery]]
= Osquery

https://osquery.io[Osquery] is an open source tool that lets you query operating systems, like a database, providing you with visibility into your infrastructure and operating systems.
Using basic SQL commands, you can ask questions about devices, such as servers, 
Docker containers, and computers running Linux, macOS, or Windows.
The https://osquery.io/schema[extensive schema] helps with a variety of use cases,
including vulnerability detection, compliance monitoring, incident investigations, and more.  

With Osquery, you can:

 * Run live queries for one or more agents
 * Schedule queries to capture changes to OS state over time
 * View a history of past queries and their results
 * Save queries and build a library of queries for specific use cases

Osquery results are stored in {es}, so that you can 
search, analyze, and visualize Osquery data in {kib}.

Osquery is powered by the *Osquery Manager* integration.
For information on how to set up *Osquery Manager*, refer to <<manage-osquery-integration>>.

[float]
== Required privileges

To use *Osquery Manager*, you must be assigned to a role with the following privileges:

* `Read` privileges for the `logs-osquery_manager.result*` index.
* {kib} privileges for **Osquery Manager**. The `All` privilege
enables you to run, schedule, and save queries. `Read` enables you to
view live and scheduled query results, but you cannot run live queries or edit.

[float]
[[osquery-run-query]]
==  Run live queries

To inspect a host or test queries you want to schedule, run a query against one or more agents or policies,
and view the results.

. Open the main menu, and then click *Osquery*.

. In the *Live queries* view, click **New live query**.

. Select one or more agents or groups to query. Start typing in the search field,
and you'll get suggestions for agents by name, ID, platform, and policy.

. Enter a query or select a query from your saved queries.
+

. Click **Submit**.

. Review the results in a table, or navigate to *Discover* to dive deeper into the response,
or to the drag-and-drop *Lens* editor to create visualizations.
. To view more information about the request, such as failures, open the *Status* tab.
. To optionally save the query for future use, click *Save for later* and define the ID,
description, and other
<<osquery-manage-query,details>>.

To view a history of the past queries you have run, open the *Live queries history*.

* To replay a query, click image:images/play-icon.png[Right-pointing triangle].

* To view the query <<osquery-results,results>> and <<osquery-status,status>>,
click image:images/table-icon.png[Table icon].

[float]
[[osquery-schedule-query]]
== Schedule queries

Group and schedule queries to run on a specified interval, in seconds.
For example, you might create a group that checks
for IT compliance-type issues, and
another group that monitors for evidence of malware.

. Open the **Scheduled query groups** tab.

. Click a group name to view the details.
+
Details include the last time each query ran, how many results were returned, and the number of agents the query ran against.
If there are errors, expand the row to view the details.

image::images/scheduled-query-groupds.png[Shows last results last time it ran, how many results returned, number of agents it ran against, if it is actually running and if there are errors]

. To make changes, click *Edit*.

.. To add a query to the group, click *Add query*, and then enter the query ID and interval.
Optionally, set the minimum Osquery version and platform,
or <<osquery-map-fields,map ECS fields>>.

.. To upload queries from a .conf query pack, drag the pack to the drop zone under the query table. To explore the community packs that Osquery publishes, click *Example packs*.

. Click *Save query*. The queries run when the policy receives the update.

. View scheduled history results in <<discover,*Discover*> or the drag-and-drop <<lens,*Lens*>> editor.


[float]
[[osquery-map-fields]]
== Map Osquery fields to ECS fields

When you schedule queries, you can optionally map query results to fields in
the {ecs-ref}/ecs-reference.html[Elastic Common Schema] (ECS),
which standardizes your Osquery data for use across detections, machine learning,
and any other areas that rely on ECS-compliant data.
The query results include the original `osquery.<field>`
and the mapped ECS field. For example, if you update a query to map `osquery.name` to `user.name`, the query results include both fields.

. Edit a scheduled query group, and then click the edit icon for the query that you want to map.

. In **ECS mapping**, select the Osquery result fields you want to map to ECS fields.
+
The fields available in the **Osquery.results** column are based on the SQL query entered,
and only include fields that the query returns.

When mapping fields:

. To add a new row for additional fields to map, click the plus icon.

. To remove any mapped rows, click the trash icon.

. To save changes to the query, click *Save*.

. To save changes to the group, click *Save query*.


[float]
[[osquery-manage-query]]
== Edit saved queries

Add or edit saved queries to the *Saved queries* tab.

. Go to the saved queries, then click **Add saved query** or the edit icon.
. Provide the following fields:

* The unique identifier.

* A brief description.

* The SQL query.

* The defaults for the scheduled query group, which is included when you add the query to a scheduled query group.

** The frequency to run the query.

** The minimum https://github.com/osquery/osquery/releases)[version of Osquery] required to run the query.

** The operating system required to run the query. For information about supported platforms per table, click *OSquery schema* in the *Edit query* flyout.

. Click **Save query**.

[float]
[[osquery-status]]
== Osquery status

A query can have the following status:

[cols="2*<"]
|===
| Successful | The query successfully completed.
| Failed | The query encountered a problem, such as an issue with the query or the agent was disconnected, and might have failed.
| Not yet responded | The query has not been sent to the agent.
| Expired | The action request timed out. The agent may be offline.
|===

NOTE: If an agent is offline, the request status remains **pending** as {kib} retries the request.
By default, a query request times out after five minutes. The time out applies to the time it takes
to deliver the action request to an agent to run a query. If the action completes after the timeout period,
the results are still returned.


[float]
[[osquery-results]]
== Osquery results

For the fields that can be returned in Osquery results,
refer to https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/osquery_manager#exported-fields[exported fields].
Scheduled Osquery
results can also include ECS fields, if the query has a defined ECS mapping.

Osquery responses include the following information:

* Everything prefaced with `osquery.` is part of the query response. These fields are not mapped to ECS.

* By default, the `host.*` and `agent.*` fields are mapped to ECS.

* The `action_data.query` has the query that was sent.

* All query results are https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/logging/#snapshot-logs[snapshot logs]
that represent a point in time with a set of results, with no differentials.
https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/logging/#differential-logs[Differential logs] are unsupported.

* Osquery data is stored in the `logs-osquery_manager.result-default` datastream, and the result row data is under the `osquery` property in the document.

The following example shows a successful Osquery result:

== Manage the integration

[float]
== System requirements

* {fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[Fleet] is enabled on your cluster, and
one or more {fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-installation.html[Elastic Agents] is enrolled.
* The https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/osquery_manager[*Osquery Manager*] integration
has been added and configured
for an agent policy through Fleet.
This integration supports x64 architecture on Windows, MacOS, and Linux platforms, 
and ARM64 architecture on Linux.

NOTE: The original {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-osquery.html[Filebeat Osquery module]
and the https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/osquery[Osquery Log Collection]
integration collect logs from self-managed Osquery deployments.
The *Osquery Manager* integration manages Osquery deployments
and supports running and scheduling queries from {kib}.

[float]
== Customize Osquery sub-feature privileges

Depending on your https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription level],
you can further customize the sub-feature privileges
for *Osquery Manager*. These include options to grant specific access for running live queries,
running saved queries, saving queries, and scheduling queries. For example,
you can create roles for users who can only run live or saved queries, but who cannot save or schedule queries.
This is useful for teams who need in-depth and detailed control.

[float]
== Upgrade Osquery versions

The https://github.com/osquery/osquery/releases[Osquery version] available on an Elastic Agent
is associated to the version of Osquery Beat on the Agent.
To get the latest version of Osquery Beat,
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/master/upgrade-elastic-agent.html[upgrade your Elastic Agent].

[float]
== Debug issues
If you encounter issues with *Osquery Manager*, find the relevant logs for the {elastic-agent}
and Osquerybeat in the installed agent directory, then adjust the agent path for your setup. 

The relevant logs look similar to the following example paths:

```ts
`/data/elastic-agent-054e22/logs/elastic-agent-json.log-*`
`/data/elastic-agent-054e22/logs/default/osquerybeat-json.log`
```

To get more details in the logs, change the agent logging level to debug:

. Open the main menu, and then select **Fleet**.

. Select the agent that you want to debug.

. On the **Logs** tab, change the **Agent logging level** to **debug**, and then click **Apply changes**.
+
`agent.logging.level` is updated in `fleet.yml`, and the logging level is changed to `debug`.
