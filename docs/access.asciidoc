== Accessing Kibana

Kibana is a web application that you access through port 5601. All you need to 
do is point your web browser at the machine where Kibana is running and 
specify the port number. For example, `localhost:5601` or `http://YOURDOMAIN.com:5601`.

When you access Kibana, the Discover page loads by default with the default index
pattern selected. The time filter is set to the last 15 minutes and the search 
query is set to match-all (\*).

If you don't see any documents, try setting the time filter to a wider time range.
If you still don't see any results, it's possible that you don't *have* any documents.
