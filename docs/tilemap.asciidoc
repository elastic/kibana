=== Tile Maps

A tile map displays a geographic area overlaid with circles keyed to the data determined by the buckets you specify.

The default _metrics_ aggregation for a tile map is the *Count* aggregation. You can select any of the following 
aggregations as the metrics aggregation:

*Count*:: The {ref}search-aggregations-metrics-valuecount-aggregation.html[_count_] aggregation returns a raw count of 
the elements in the selected index pattern.
*Average*:: This aggregation returns the {ref}search-aggregations-metrics-avg-aggregation.html[_average_] of a numeric 
field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Sum*:: The {ref}search-aggregations-metrics-sum-aggregation.html[_sum_] aggregation returns the total sum of a numeric 
field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Min*:: The {ref}search-aggregations-metrics-min-aggregation.html[_min_] aggregation returns the minimum value of a 
numeric field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Max*:: The {ref}search-aggregations-metrics-max-aggregation.html[_max_] aggregation returns the maximum value of a 
numeric field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Unique Count*:: The {ref}search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html[_cardinality_] aggregation returns 
the number of unique values in a field. Select a field from the drop-down.

Enter a string in the *Custom Label* field to change the display label.

The _buckets_ aggregations determine what information is being retrieved from your data set.

Before you choose a buckets aggregation, specify if you are splitting the chart or displaying the buckets as *Geo 
Coordinates* on a single chart. A multiple chart split must run before any other aggregations.

Tile maps use the *Geohash* aggregation as their initial aggregation. Select a field, typically coordinates, from the
drop-down. The *Precision* slider determines the granularity of the results displayed on the map. See the documentation 
for the {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.html#_cell_dimensions_at_the_equator[geohash grid] 
aggregation for details on the area specified by each precision level. Kibana supports a maximum geohash length of 7.

NOTE: Higher precisions increase memory usage for the browser displaying Kibana as well as for the underlying 
Elasticsearch cluster.

Once you've specified a buckets aggregation, you can define sub-aggregations to refine the visualization. Tile maps 
only support sub-aggregations as split charts. Click *+ Add Sub Aggregation*, then *Split Chart* to select a 
sub-aggregation from the list of types:

*Date Histogram*:: A {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html[_date histogram_] is built from a 
numeric field and organized by date. You can specify a time frame for the intervals in seconds, minutes, hours, days, 
weeks, months, or years. You can also specify a custom interval frame by selecting *Custom* as the interval and 
specifying a number and a time unit in the text field. Custom interval time units are *s* for seconds, *m* for minutes, 
*h* for hours, *d* for days, *w* for weeks, and *y* for years. Different units support different levels of precision, 
down to one second.
*Histogram*:: A standard {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-histogram-aggregation.html[_histogram_] is built from a 
numeric field. Specify an integer interval for this field. Select the *Show empty buckets* checkbox to include empty 
intervals in the histogram.
*Range*:: With a {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-range-aggregation.html[_range_] aggregation, you can specify ranges 
of values for a numeric field. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints. Click the red *(x)* symbol to remove 
a range.
After changing options, click the  *Apply changes* button to update your visualization, or the grey *Discard 
changes* button to keep your visualization in its current state.
*Date Range*:: A {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-daterange-aggregation.html[_date range_] aggregation reports values 
that are within a range of dates that you specify. You can specify the ranges for the dates using 
{ref}common-options.html#date-math[_date math_] expressions. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints. 
Click the red *(/)* symbol to remove a range.
*IPv4 Range*:: The {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-iprange-aggregation.html[_IPv4 range_] aggregation enables you to
specify ranges of IPv4 addresses. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints. Click the red *(/)* symbol to 
remove a range.
*Terms*:: A {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[_terms_] aggregation enables you to specify the top 
or bottom _n_ elements of a  given field to display, ordered by count or a custom metric.
*Filters*:: You can specify a set of {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-filters-aggregation.html[_filters_] for the data. 
You can specify a filter as a query string or in JSON format, just as in the Discover search bar. Click *Add Filter* to 
add another filter. Click the image:images/labelbutton.png[] *label* button to open the label field, where you can type 
in a name to display on the visualization.
*Significant Terms*:: Displays the results of the experimental 
{ref}search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html[_significant terms_] aggregation. The value of the 
*Size* parameter defines the number of entries this aggregation returns.
*Geohash*:: The {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.html[_geohash_] aggregation displays points 
based on the geohash coordinates.

NOTE: By default, the *Change precision on map zoom* box is checked. Uncheck the box to disable this behavior.

Enter a string in the *Custom Label* field to change the display label.

You can click the *Advanced* link to display more customization options for your metrics or bucket aggregation:

*Exclude Pattern*:: Specify a pattern in this field to exclude from the results.
*Include Pattern*:: Specify a pattern in this field to include in the results.
*JSON Input*:: A text field where you can add specific JSON-formatted properties to merge with the aggregation 
definition, as in the following example:

[source,shell]
{ "script" : "doc['grade'].value * 1.2" }

NOTE: In Elasticsearch releases 1.4.3 and later, this functionality requires you to enable 
{ref}modules-scripting.html[dynamic Groovy scripting].

The availability of these options varies depending on the aggregation you choose.

Select the *Options* tab to change the following aspects of the chart:

*Map type*:: Select one of the following options from the drop-down.
*_Scaled Circle Markers_*:: Scale the size of the markers based on the metric aggregation's value.
*_Shaded Circle Markers_*:: Displays the markers with different shades based on the metric aggregation's value.
*_Shaded Geohash Grid_*:: Displays the rectangular cells of the geohash grid instead of circular markers, with different 
shades based on the metric aggregation's value.
*_Heatmap_*:: A heat map applies blurring to the circle markers and applies shading based on the amount of overlap. 
Heatmaps have the following options:

* *Radius*: Sets the size of the individual heatmap dots.
* *Blur*: Sets the amount of blurring for the heatmap dots.
* *Maximum zoom*: Tilemaps in Kibana support 18 zoom levels. This slider defines the maximum zoom level at which the 
heatmap dots appear at full intensity.
* *Minimum opacity*: Sets the opacity cutoff for the dots.
* *Show Tooltip*: Check this box to have a tooltip with the values for a given dot when the cursor is on that dot.

*Desaturate map tiles*:: Desaturate the map's color in order to make the markers stand out more clearly.
*WMS compliant map server*:: Check this box to enable the use of a third-party mapping service that complies with the Web
Map Service (WMS) standard. Specify the following elements:

* *WMS url*: The URL for the WMS map service.
* *WMS layers*: A comma-separated list of the layers to use in this visualization. Each map server provides its own list of
layers.
* *WMS version*: The WMS version used by this map service.
* *WMS format*: The image format used by this map service. The two most common formats are `image/png` and `image/jpeg`.
* *WMS attribution*: An optional, user-defined string that identifies the map source. Maps display the attribution string 
in the lower right corner.
* *WMS styles*: A comma-separated list of the styles to use in this visualization. Each map server provides its own styling 
options.

After changing options, click the  *Apply changes* button to update your visualization, or the grey *Discard 
changes* button to keep your visualization in its current state.

==== Navigating the Map
Once your tilemap visualization is ready, you can explore the map in several ways:

* Click and hold anywhere on the map and move the cursor to move the map center. Hold Shift and drag a bounding box 
across the map to zoom in on the selection. 
* Click the *Zoom In/Out* image:images/viz-zoom.png[] buttons to change the zoom level manually.
* Click the *Fit Data Bounds* image:images/viz-fit-bounds.png[] button to automatically crop the map boundaries to the 
geohash buckets that have at least one result.
* Click the *Latitude/Longitude Filter* image:images/viz-lat-long-filter.png[] button, then drag a bounding box across the 
map, to create a filter for the box coordinates.
