== Creating {dataframe-transforms}

beta[]

If you want to use the {dataframe-transforms} feature, you must have the required 
user roles and permissions:

* `data_frame_transforms_user`: to get transforms and transforms stats,
* `data_frame_transforms_admin`: to create/start/stop/delete transforms,
* read permissions on the source indices,
* index permissions on the target index (if the target index does not exist, you 
need permission to create the index as well).

You can create {dataframe-transforms} in the {kib} Machine Learning application. 
Select an index or a search pattern you want to transform and a field that the data 
will be grouped-by, then define the desired aggregation. The {dataframe} pivot 
preview on the right side provides a visual verification.

Once you created the pivot, add a job ID and define the index dedicated to the 
transformed data (_target index_). If the target index does not exist, it will be 
created automatically if you have the required permission. At the end of the process, 
a {dataframe} job is created as a result. After the job is started, you have further
options to continue exploring it.
