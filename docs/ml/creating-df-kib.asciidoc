== Creating {dataframe-transforms}

beta[]

You can create {stack-ov}/ml-dataframes.html[{dataframe-transforms}] in the 
{kib} Machine Learning application.

Select the index pattern or saved search you want to transform. To pivot your 
data, you must group the data by at least one field and apply at least one 
aggregation. The {dataframe} pivot preview on the right side provides a visual 
verification.

Once you have created the pivot, add a job ID and define the index for the 
transformed data (_target index_). If the target index does not exist, it will be 
created automatically. You can optionally select to create a {kib} index pattern 
for the target index. At the end of the process, a {dataframe} job is created as 
a result. After you create {dataframe} jobs, you can start, stop, and delete them 
and explore their progress and statistics from the jobs list.

[NOTE]
===============================
If you want to use the {dataframe-transforms} feature, you must have the required 
user roles and permissions:

* `data_frame_transforms_user`: to get transforms and transforms stats,
* `data_frame_transforms_admin`: to create/start/stop/delete transforms,
* read permissions and `view_index_metadata` on the source indices,
* index and read permissions on the target index (if the target index does not 
exist, you need permission to create the index as well).
