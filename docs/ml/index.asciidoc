As datasets increase in size and complexity, the human effort required to
inspect dashboards or maintain rules for spotting infrastructure problems,
cyber attacks, or business issues becomes impractical. The Elastic {ml-features}
automatically model the normal behavior of your time series data — learning
trends, periodicity, and more — in real time to identify anomalies, streamline
root cause analysis, and reduce false positives.

The {ml-features} run in and scale with {es}, and include an
intuitive UI on the {kib} *Machine Learning* page for creating anomaly detection
jobs and understanding results.

If you have a basic license, you can use the *Data Visualizer* to learn more 
about the data that you've stored in {es} and to identify possible fields for 
{ml} analysis:

experimental[] You can also upload a CSV, NDJSON, or log file (up to 100 MB in size). 
The {ml-features} identify the file format and field mappings. You can then 
optionally import that data into an {es} index.  

If you have a trial or platinum license, you can <<ml-jobs,create {ml} jobs>> 
and manage jobs and {dfeeds} from the *Job Management* pane:

You can use the *Settings* pane to create and edit 
{stack-ov}/ml-calendars.html[calendars] and the filters that are used in 
{stack-ov}/ml-rules.html[custom rules]:

The *Anomaly Explorer* and *Single Metric Viewer* display the results of your
{ml} jobs. For example:

NOTE: The {kib} {ml-features} use pop-ups. You must configure your
web browser so that it does not block pop-up windows or create an exception for
your {kib} URL.

For more information about {ml}, see
{stack-ov}/xpack-ml.html[Machine learning in the {stack}].
