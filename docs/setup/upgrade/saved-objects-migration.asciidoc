=== Migrate saved objects

Each time you upgrade {kib}, an upgrade migration is performed to ensure that all <<managing-saved-objects,saved objects>> are compatible with the new version.

NOTE: {kib} includes an <<upgrade-assistant,*Upgrade Assistant*>> to help you prepare for an upgrade.
To access the assistant, go to *Stack Management > Upgrade Assistant*.

WARNING: {kib} 7.12.0 and later uses a new migration process and index naming scheme. Before you upgrade, read the documentation for your version of {kib}.

WARNING: The following instructions assumes {kib} is using the default index names. If the `kibana.index` or `xpack.tasks.index` configuration settings are different from the default, adapt the instructions accordingly.

==== How saved objects migrations work

Saved objects are stored in two indices:

* `.kibana_{kibana_version}_001`, e.g. for {kib} 7.12.0 `.kibana_7.12.0_001`.
* `.kibana_task_manager_{kibana_version}_001`, e.g. for {kib} 7.12.0 `.kibana_task_manager_7.12.0_001`.

The index aliases `.kibana` and `.kibana_task_manager` always point to
the most up-to-date saved object indices.

When you start a new {kib} installation, an upgrade migration is performed before starting plugins or serving HTTP traffic.
Before you upgrade, shut down old nodes to prevent losing acknowledged writes.
To reduce the likelihood of old nodes losing acknowledged writes, {kib} 7.12.0 and later
adds a write block to the outdated index.

The following tables lists the saved objects indices used by previous {kib} versions.
