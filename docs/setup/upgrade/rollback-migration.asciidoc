=== Roll back to a previous version of {kib}

If you've followed <<preventing-migration-failures, preparing for migration>>
and <<resolve-migrations-failures, resolving migration failures>>, and
{kib} is still unable to successfully upgrade, rollback {kib} until
you're able to identify and fix the root cause.

WARNING: Before you roll back {kib}, ensure that the version you want to roll back to is compatible with
your {es} cluster. If the version you want to roll back to is not compatible, you must also rollback {es}.
Any changes made after an upgrade are lost when you roll back to a previous version.

To roll back after a failed upgrade migration, you must also roll back the {kib} feature state to be compatible with the previous {kib} version.

==== Roll back by restoring the {kib} feature state from a snapshot

. Before proceeding, {ref}/snapshots-take-snapshot.html[take a snapshot] that contains the `kibana` feature state.
   By default, snapshots include the `kibana` feature state.
. To make sure no {kib} instances are performing an upgrade migration, shut down all {kib} instances.
. {ref}/snapshots-restore-snapshot.html[Restore] the `kibana` feature state from a snapshot taken before the failed {kib} upgrade. The following {es} request will only restore the {kib} feature state 
+
[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
POST _snapshot/my_repository/my_snapshot_2099.05.06/_restore
{
  "indices": "-*", <1>
  "feature_states": ["kibana"]
}
--------------------------------------------
<1> Exclude all indices and data streams from the restore operation to ensure that only the {kib} system indices included in the {kib} feature state will be restored.
. Start all {kib} instances on the older version you want to rollback to.
