=== New Installation

Kibana 4.0 introduced a major architectural overhaul. As a result, the
underlying `.kibana` schema changed so significantly that upgrading from Kibana
3.x requires recreating all visualizations, dashboards, etc.

If you're upgrading from 3.x, please follow the
<<install,installation instructions>> to install Kibana from scratch, and then
manually recreate your searches, visualizations, and dashboards.
