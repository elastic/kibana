[[settings]]
== Configure {kib}

The {kib} server reads properties from the `kibana.yml` file on startup. The
location of this file differs depending on how you installed {kib}. For example,
if you installed {kib} from an archive distribution (`.tar.gz` or `.zip`), by
default it is in `$KIBANA_HOME/config`. By default, with package distributions
(Debian or RPM), it is in `/etc/kibana`.  The config directory can be changed via the
`KBN_PATH_CONF` environment variable:

[source,text]
--
KBN_PATH_CONF=/home/kibana/config ./bin/kibana
--

The default host and port settings configure {kib} to run on `localhost:5601`. To change this behavior and allow remote users to connect, you'll need to update your `kibana.yml` file. You can also enable SSL and set a
variety of other options. Finally, environment variables can be injected into
configuration using `${MY_ENV_VAR}` syntax.

`console.ui.enabled`::
Toggling this causes the server to regenerate assets on the next startup,
which may cause a delay before pages start being served.
Set to `false` to disable Console. *Default: `true`*

`csp.script_src`::
Add sources for the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src[Content Security Policy `script-src` directive].

`csp.disableUnsafeEval`::
experimental[] Set this to `true` to remove the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src#unsafe_eval_expressions[`unsafe-eval`] source expression from the `script-src` directive. *Default: `false`*
+
By enabling `csp.disableUnsafeEval`, Kibana will use a custom version of the Handlebars template library which doesn't support https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html#inline-partials[inline partials].
Handlebars is used in various locations in the Kibana frontend where custom templates can be supplied by the user when for instance setting up a visualisation.
If you experience any issues rendering Handlebars templates after turning on `csp.disableUnsafeEval`, or if you rely on inline partials, please revert this setting to `false` and https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/new/choose[open an issue] in the Kibana GitHub repository.

`csp.frame_ancestors`::
Add sources for the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors[Content Security Policy `frame-ancestors` directive].
+
NOTE: The `frame-ancestors` directive can also be configured by using
<<server-securityResponseHeaders-disableEmbedding, `server.securityResponseHeaders.disableEmbedding`>>. In that case, that takes precedence and any values in `csp.frame_ancestors`
are ignored.

`csp.report_uri`::
Add sources for the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-uri[Content Security Policy `report-uri` directive].

[[csp-strict]] `csp.strict`::
Blocks {kib} access to any browser that
does not enforce even rudimentary CSP rules. In practice, this disables
support for older, less safe browsers like Internet Explorer.
For more information, refer to <<csp-strict-mode, Content Security Policy>>.
*Default: `true`*

`csp.warnLegacyBrowsers`::
Shows a warning message after loading {kib} to any browser that does not
enforce even rudimentary CSP rules, though {kib} is still accessible. This
configuration is effectively ignored when <<csp-strict, `csp.strict`>> is enabled.
*Default: `true`*

[[elasticsearch-maxSockets]] `elasticsearch.maxSockets`::
The maximum number of sockets that can be used for communications with {es}.
*Default: `Infinity`*

*Default: `60s`*

`elasticsearch.customHeaders`::
 | Header names and values to send to {es}. Any custom headers cannot be
overwritten by client-side headers, regardless of the
<<elasticsearch-requestHeadersWhitelist, `elasticsearch.requestHeadersWhitelist`>> configuration. *Default: `{}`*

*Default: the value of the <<elasticsearch-requestTimeout, `elasticsearch.requestTimeout`>> setting*

[[elasticsearch-requestHeadersWhitelist]] `elasticsearch.requestHeadersWhitelist`::
List of {kib} client-side headers to send to {es}. To send *no* client-side
headers, set this value to [] (an empty list). Removing the `authorization`
header from being whitelisted means that you cannot use
<<basic-authentication, basic authentication>> in {kib}.
*Default: `[ 'authorization' ]`*

[[elasticsearch-requestTimeout]] `elasticsearch.requestTimeout`::
Time in milliseconds to wait for responses from the back end or {es}.
This value must be a positive integer. *Default: `30000`*

+
WARNING: When {es} uses certificates to authenticate end users with a PKI realm
and <<elasticsearch-ssl-alwaysPresentCertificate, `elasticsearch.ssl.alwaysPresentCertificate`>> is `true`,
proxied requests may be executed as the identity that is tied to the {kib}
server.

[[elasticsearch-ssl-cert-key]] `elasticsearch.ssl.certificate` and `elasticsearch.ssl.key`::
Paths to a PEM-encoded X.509 client certificate and its corresponding
private key. These are used by {kib} to authenticate itself when making
outbound SSL/TLS connections to {es}. For this setting to take effect, the
`xpack.security.http.ssl.client_authentication` setting in {es} must be also
be set to `"required"` or `"optional"` to request a client certificate from
{kib}.
+
NOTE: These settings cannot be used in conjunction with
<<elasticsearch-ssl-keystore-path, `elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.path`>>.

[[elasticsearch-ssl-certificateAuthorities]] `elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities`::
Paths to one or more PEM-encoded X.509 certificate authority (CA)
certificates, which make up a trusted certificate chain for {es}. This chain is
used by {kib} to establish trust when making outbound SSL/TLS connections to
{es}.
+
In addition to this setting, trusted certificates may be specified via
<<elasticsearch-ssl-keystore-path, `elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.path`>> and/or
<<elasticsearch-ssl-truststore-path, `elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path`>>.

`elasticsearch.ssl.keyPassphrase`::
The password that decrypts the private key that is specified

encrypted.

[[elasticsearch-ssl-keystore-path]] `elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.path`::
Path to a PKCS#12 keystore that contains an X.509 client certificate and it's
corresponding private key. These are used by {kib} to authenticate itself when
making outbound SSL/TLS connections to {es}. For this setting, you must also set
the `xpack.security.http.ssl.client_authentication` setting in {es} to
`"required"` or `"optional"` to request a client certificate from {kib}.
+
If the keystore contains any additional certificates, they are used as a
trusted certificate chain for {es}. This chain is used by {kib} to establish
trust when making outbound SSL/TLS connections to {es}. In addition to this
setting, trusted certificates may be specified via
<<elasticsearch-ssl-certificateAuthorities, `elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities`>> and/or
<<elasticsearch-ssl-truststore-path, `elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path`>>.
+
NOTE: This setting cannot be used in conjunction with
<<elasticsearch-ssl-cert-key, `elasticsearch.ssl.certificate`>> or <<elasticsearch-ssl-cert-key, `elasticsearch.ssl.key`>>.

`elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.password`::
The password that decrypts the keystore specified via
<<elasticsearch-ssl-keystore-path, `elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.path`>>. If the keystore has no password, leave this

`""`.

[[elasticsearch-ssl-truststore-path]] `elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path`::
Path to a PKCS#12 trust store that contains one or more X.509 certificate
authority (CA) certificates, which make up a trusted certificate chain for
{es}. This chain is used by {kib} to establish trust when making outbound
SSL/TLS connections to {es}.
+
In addition to this setting, trusted certificates may be specified via
<<elasticsearch-ssl-certificateAuthorities, `elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities`>> and/or
<<elasticsearch-ssl-keystore-path, `elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.path`>>.

`elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.password`::
The password that decrypts the trust store specified via
<<elasticsearch-ssl-truststore-path, `elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path`>>. If the trust store
has no password, leave this as blank. If the trust store has an empty password, set this to `""`.

[[elasticsearch-ssl-verificationMode]] `elasticsearch.ssl.verificationMode`::
Controls the verification of the server certificate that {kib} receives when
making an outbound SSL/TLS connection to {es}. Valid values are `"full"`,
`"certificate"`, and `"none"`. Using `"full"` performs hostname verification,
using `"certificate"` skips hostname verification, and using `"none"` skips
verification entirely. *Default: `"full"`*

[[elasticsearch-user-passwd]] `elasticsearch.username` and `elasticsearch.password`::
If your {es} is protected with basic authentication, these settings provide
the username and password that the {kib} server uses to perform maintenance
on the {kib} index at startup. {kib} users still need to authenticate with
{es}, which is proxied through the {kib} server.

[[elasticsearch-service-account-token]] `elasticsearch.serviceAccountToken`::
If your {es} is protected with basic authentication, this token provides the credentials
that the {kib} server uses to perform maintenance on the {kib} index at startup. This setting
is an alternative to `elasticsearch.username` and `elasticsearch.password`.

`interpreter.enableInVisualize`::
Enables use of interpreter in Visualize. *Default: `true`*

`unifiedSearch.autocomplete.valueSuggestions.timeout` {ess-icon}::

[[logging-root-appenders]] `logging.root.appenders`::
A list of logging appenders to forward the root level logger instance to.  By default `root` is configured with the `default` appender that logs to stdout with a `pattern` layout. This is the configuration that all custom loggers will use unless they're re-configured explicitly. You can override the default behavior by configuring a different <<logging-appenders, appender>> to apply to `root`.

[[logging-root-level]] `logging.root.level` {ess-icon}::
Level at which a log record should be logged. Supported levels are: _all_, _fatal_, _error_, _warn_, _info_, _debug_, _trace_, _off_. Levels are ordered from _all_ (highest) to _off_ and a log record will be logged it its level is higher than or equal to the level of its logger, otherwise the log record is ignored. Use this value to <<change-overall-log-level,change the overall log level>>. *Default: `info`*.
+
TIP: Set to `all` to log all events, including system usage information and all requests. Set to `off` to silence all logs.  You can also use the logging <<logging-cli-migration, cli commands>> to set log level to `verbose` or silence all logs.
+
The following example shows a valid verbose `logging.root` configuration:
+
[source,text]
--
logging:
  appenders:
    console_appender:
      type: console

connections. Valid values are `"required"`, `"optional"`, and `"none"`. Using `"required"` will refuse to establish the connection unless a
client presents a certificate, using `"optional"` will allow a client to present a certificate if it has one, and using `"none"` will
prevent a client from presenting a certificate. *Default: `"none"`*

[[server-ssl-enabled]] `server.ssl.enabled`::
 | Enables SSL/TLS for inbound connections to {kib}. When set to `true`, a certificate and its
corresponding private key must be provided. These can be specified via <<server-ssl-keystore-path, `server.ssl.keystore.path`>> or the combination of
<<server-ssl-cert-key, `server.ssl.certificate`>> and <<server-ssl-cert-key, `server.ssl.key`>>. *Default: `false`*

`server.ssl.keyPassphrase`::
The password that decrypts the private key that is specified via <<server-ssl-cert-key, `server.ssl.key`>>. This value
is optional, as the key may not be encrypted.

[[server-ssl-keystore-path]] `server.ssl.keystore.path`::
Path to a PKCS#12 keystore that contains an X.509 server certificate and its corresponding private key. If the
keystore contains any additional certificates, those will be used as a trusted certificate chain for {kib}. All of these are used by {kib}
to establish trust when receiving inbound SSL/TLS connections from end users. The certificate chain is also used by {kib} to verify client
certificates from end users when PKI authentication is enabled.
+
In addition to this setting, trusted certificates may be specified via <<server-ssl-certificateAuthorities, `server.ssl.certificateAuthorities`>> and/or
<<server-ssl-truststore-path, `server.ssl.truststore.path`>>.
+
NOTE: This setting cannot be used in conjunction with <<server-ssl-cert-key, `server.ssl.certificate`>> or <<server-ssl-cert-key, `server.ssl.key`>>

`server.ssl.keystore.password`::
The password that will be used to decrypt the keystore specified via <<server-ssl-keystore-path, `server.ssl.keystore.path`>>. If the
keystore has no password, leave this unset. If the keystore has an empty password, set this to `""`.

[[server-ssl-truststore-path]] `server.ssl.truststore.path`::
Path to a PKCS#12 trust store that contains one or more X.509 certificate authority (CA) certificates which
make up a trusted certificate chain for {kib}. This chain is used by {kib} to establish trust when receiving inbound SSL/TLS connections
from end users. If PKI authentication is enabled, this chain is also used by {kib} to verify client certificates from end users.
+
In addition to this setting, trusted certificates may be specified via <<server-ssl-certificateAuthorities, `server.ssl.certificateAuthorities`>> and/or
<<server-ssl-keystore-path, `server.ssl.keystore.path`>>.

`server.ssl.truststore.password`::
The password that will be used to decrypt the trust store specified via <<server-ssl-truststore-path, `server.ssl.truststore.path`>>. If
the trust store has no password, leave this unset. If the trust store has an empty password, set this to `""`.

`server.ssl.redirectHttpFromPort`::
{kib} binds to this port and redirects
all http requests to https over the port configured as <<server-port, `server.port`>>.

[[server-ssl-supportedProtocols]] `server.ssl.supportedProtocols`::
An array of supported protocols with versions.
Valid protocols: `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`, `TLSv1.3`. *Default: TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3*

[[server-uuid]] `server.uuid`::
The unique identifier for this {kib} instance. It must be a valid UUIDv4. It gets automatically generated on the first startup if not specified and persisted in the `data` path.

[[settings-xsrf-allowlist]] `server.xsrf.allowlist`::
It is not recommended to disable protections for
arbitrary API endpoints. Instead, supply the `kbn-xsrf` header.
The <<settings-xsrf-allowlist, `server.xsrf.allowlist`>> setting requires the following format:
+
[source,text]
----
*Default: [ ]* An array of API endpoints which should be exempt from Cross-Site Request Forgery ("XSRF") protections.
----

[[settings-xsrf-disableProtection]] `server.xsrf.disableProtection`::
Setting this to `true` will completely disable Cross-site request forgery protection in Kibana. This is not recommended. *Default: `false`*

`status.allowAnonymous`::
If authentication is enabled,
setting this to `true` enables unauthenticated users to access the {kib}
server status API and status page. *Default: `false`*

[[telemetry-allowChangingOptInStatus]] `telemetry.allowChangingOptInStatus`::
When `true`, users are able to change the telemetry setting at a later time in
<<advanced-options, Advanced Settings>>.  When `false`, users cannot change the opt-in status through *Advanced Settings*, and
{kib} only looks at the value of <<settings-telemetry-optIn, `telemetry.optIn`>> to determine whether to send telemetry data or not. *Default: `true`*.

[[settings-telemetry-optIn]] `telemetry.optIn`::
Reporting your cluster statistics helps
us improve your user experience. Your data is never shared with anyone.
Set to `true` to allow telemetry data to be sent to Elastic.
When `false`, the telemetry data is never sent to Elastic. +
+
This setting can be changed at any time in <<advanced-options, Advanced Settings>>.
To prevent users from changing it,
set <<telemetry-allowChangingOptInStatus, `telemetry.allowChangingOptInStatus`>> to `false`.
*Default: `true`*

`vis_type_vega.enableExternalUrls` {ess-icon}::
Set this value to true to allow Vega to use any URL to access external data
sources and images. When false, Vega can only get data from {es}. *Default: `false`*

`xpack.ccr.ui.enabled`::
Set this value to false to disable the Cross-Cluster Replication UI.
*Default: `true`*

[[settings-explore-data-in-context]] `xpack.discoverEnhanced.actions.exploreDataInContextMenu.enabled`::
Enables the *Explore underlying data* option that allows you to open *Discover* from a dashboard panel and view the panel data. *Default: `false`*
+
When you create visualizations using the *Lens* drag-and-drop editor, you can use the toolbar to open and explore your data in *Discover*. For more information, check out <<explore-lens-data-in-discover, Explore the data in Discover>>. 

[[settings-explore-data-in-chart]] `xpack.discoverEnhanced.actions.exploreDataInChart.enabled`::
Enables you to view the underlying documents in a data series from a dashboard panel. *Default: `false`*

`xpack.ilm.ui.enabled`::
Set this value to false to disable the Index Lifecycle Policies UI.
*Default: `true`*

`xpack.index_management.ui.enabled`::
Set this value to false to disable the Index Management UI.
