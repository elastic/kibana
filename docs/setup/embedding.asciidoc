== Embed {kib} content in a web page

Once you create a dashboard or a visualization, you might want to share it with your colleagues or friends. The easiest way to do this is to share a direct link to your dashboard or visualization. However, some users might not have access to your {kib}.

With the {kib} embedding functionality, you can display the content you created in {kib} to an internal company website or a personal web page.

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard* or *Visualize Library*.

. Open the dashboard or visualization you want to embed.

. To generate the HTML code snippet, open the *Share* menu, then click *Embed code > Copy iFrame code*.
+
You can embed this snippet in your web page, and then add analysis, images, and links to give more context to the object you're sharing.

NOTE: Embedding of any other part of {kib} is also generally possible, but you might need to craft the proper HTML code manually.

[[embedding-security]]
=== Configure security

Embedding content through iframes requires careful consideration to minimize security risks. By default, modern web browsers enforce the
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy[same-origin policy] to restrict the behavior of framed pages. When
{stack-security-features} are enabled on your cluster, you must relax this constraint for cookies as described in <<embedding-cookies, Cookies>> for {kib} to function
in an iframe. Refer to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe[iframe] and
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite[SameSite cookies] for more information.

==== Authentication
If you're embedding {kib} in a website that supports Single Sign-On with SAML, OpenID Connect, Kerberos, or PKI, it's highly advisable to configure {kib} as a part of the Single Sign-On setup. Operating in a single and properly configured security domain provides you with the most secure and seamless user experience. You can read more at <<kibana-authentication, Authentication in {kib}>>.

If you want users to access embedded {kib} by skipping the login step, and Single Sign-On isn't an option for you, consider configuring <<anonymous-authentication, anonymous access>>. It is already natively integrated into the workflow for embedding dashboards and visualizations.

If you have multiple authentication providers enabled, and you want to automatically log in anonymous users when embedding anything other than dashboards and visualizations, then you will need to add the `auth_provider_hint=<anonymous-provider-name>` query string parameter to the {kib} URL that you're embedding.

For example, if you craft the iframe code to embed {kib}, it might look like this:

```html
<iframe src="https://localhost:5601/app/monitoring#/elasticsearch/nodes?embed=true&_g=(....)" height="600" width="800"></iframe>
```

To make this iframe leverage anonymous access automatically, you will need to modify a link to {kib} in the `src` iframe attribute to look like this:

```html
<iframe src="https://localhost:5601/app/monitoring?auth_provider_hint=anonymous1#/elasticsearch/nodes?embed=true&_g=(....)" height="600" width="800"></iframe>
```

Note that the `auth_provider_hint` query string parameter goes *before* the hash URL fragment.

[[embedding-cookies]]
==== Cookies

Regardless of the authentication type that you're using for the embedded {kib}, you must make sure that the browsers can transmit session cookies to a {kib} server. The setting you need to be aware of is <<xpack-security-sameSiteCookies, `xpack.security.sameSiteCookies`>>. To support modern browsers, you must set it to `None`:

[source,yaml]
--
xpack.security.sameSiteCookies: "None"
--
