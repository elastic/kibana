== Upgrading {kib}

The upgrade process varies, depending on the version you're currently using.

[IMPORTANT]
===========================================
Before you upgrade:

* Consult the <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>>.
* Before you upgrade production servers, test upgrades in a dev environment.
* Back up your data with Elasticsearch {ref}/modules-snapshots.html[snapshots]. To roll back to an earlier version, you **must** have a backup of your data.
* If you are using custom plugins, check that a compatible version is
  available.
* Shut down all {kib} nodes. Running more than one version against the same {es} index is unsupported. If you upgrade while older {kib} nodes are running, the upgrade can fail.
===========================================

To determine the upgrade process to follow, refer to the table.
