== Upgrading Kibana

[IMPORTANT]
===========================================
Before upgrading Kibana:

* Consult the <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>> docs.
* Test upgrades in a dev environment before upgrading your production servers.
* Backup your data using the Elasticsearch
  {ref}/modules-snapshots.html[snapshots] feature.
  You **cannot roll back** to an earlier version unless you have a backup of
  your data.
* If you are using custom plugins, check that a compatible version is
  available.
===========================================

Depending on which version of Kibana you're upgrading from, the upgrade process
will vary. Please consult the following table to determine which process you
should follow:
