== Add data to {kib}

The fastest way to add data to {kib} is to use one of the built-in options,
available from the home page.  You can collect data from an app or service
or upload a file that contains your data.  If you're not ready to use your own data,
add a <<get-started, sample data set>> and give {kib} a test drive.

===  Add data

The *Add data* tutorials help you quickly get up and running with metrics data,
log analytics, security events, and application data. These tutorials walk you
through installing and configuring a Beats data shipper to periodically collect
and send data to {es}. You can then use the pre-built dashboards to explore and analyze the data.

If a tutorial doesnâ€™t exist for your data, go to the {beats-ref}/beats-reference.html[Beats overview]
to learn about other data shippers in the Beats family.

=== Add Elastic Agent

beta[] *Elastic Agent* is alternative to installing and managing Beats individually.
Using the *Fleet* UI, you can add
and manage integrations for popular services and platforms, giving you
an easy way to collect data. The integrations also
ship with out-of-the-box assets, including dashboards visualizations.

To get started, refer to
{ingest-guide}/ingest-management-getting-started.html[Quick start: Get logs and metrics into the Elastic Stack].

=== Upload a file

experimental[] If your data is in a CSV, JSON, or log file, you can upload it using the File
Data Visualizer. You can upload a file up to 100 MB. This value is configurable up to 1 GB in
<<kibana-ml-settings, Advanced Settings>>.

NOTE: This feature is not intended for use as part of a
repeated production process, but rather for the initial exploration of your data.

=== Load data on your own

You can index your data into Elasticsearch with {ref}/getting-started-index.html[REST APIs]
 or https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html[client libraries].
After you add your data, you must create an <<index-patterns,index pattern>> to tell
{kib} where to find the data.
