The best way to add data is to use one of our many integrations.
Alternatively, you can add a sample data set or upload a file.

=== Add an integration

Elastic integrations are a streamlined way to connect your data to the Elastic Stack.
Integrations are available for popular services and platforms, like Nginx, AWS, and MongoDB,
as well as many generic input types like log files.
Each integration comes pre-packaged with assets that support your needs:

* Data ingestion, storage, and transformation rules
* Configuration options
* Pre-built, custom dashboards and visualizations
* Documentation

To view the full list of available integrations, open the main
menu and click *Add integrations*.
{kib} automatically guides you to the *Integrations* view when no data is detected.

Use the controls on the bottom left of the **Integrations** view to determine whether to show
Elastic Agent integrations, Beats integrations, or both.
Elastic Agent is a single, unified agent
to collect data and send it to the Elastic Stack.
Beats are lightweight data shippers that send data to the Elastic Stack.
For more information,
refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/beats-agent-comparison.html[Beats and Elastic Agent capabilities].

=== Add sample data

Sample data sets come with sample visualizations, dashboards, and more to help you
explore {kib} before you ingest or upload your own data.

. On the home page, click *Try sample data*.

. Click *Add data* for the type of data that you want to add.

[[upload-data-kibana]]
=== Upload a file

If you have a log file or delimited CSV, TSV, or JSON file, you can upload it,
view its fields and metrics, and optionally import it into {es}.

NOTE: The upload feature is not intended for use as part of a repeated production
process, but rather for the initial exploration of your data.

Required privileges:

* `Data Views Management: All` {kib} feature privileges
* `all` {kib} privileges for *Discover*
* `manage_pipeline` or `manage_ingest_pipelines` cluster privilege
* `create`, `create_index`, `manage`, and `read` index privileges for the index

To upload a file:

. On the home page, click **Upload a file**.

. Drop your file on the target.
+
By default, you can upload a file up to 100 MB. This value is configurable up to 1 GB in
<<fileupload-maxfilesize,Advanced Settings>>.

. To upload a file with geospatial
data, refer to <<import-geospatial-data,Import geospatial data>>.

=== What's next?

Now that data is streaming into the Elastic Stack, take your investigation
to a deeper level. Use <<discover, **Discover**>> to quickly gain insight to your data:
search and filter your data, get information about the structure of the fields,
and present your findings in a visualization.
