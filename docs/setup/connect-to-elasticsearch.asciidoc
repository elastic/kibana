== Add data

The best way to add data to the Elastic Stack is to use one of our many integrations.
Alternatively, you can add a sample data set or upload a file.

=== Add an integration

Integrations are a way to add logs, metrics, traces,
content, and more from your apps, endpoints, infrastructure, cloud, network,
workplace tools, and other common sources in your ecosystem. All
integrations are available in a single view, and
{kib} guides you there from the Welcome screen and home page.

If an integration is available for both
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/master/beats-agent-comparison.html[Elastic Agent and Beats], the *Integrations* view defaults to the
Elastic Agent integration, if it is generally available (GA).
To switch to a
Beats integration, use the filter on the bottom left.

==== Secure your data

Collect metrics and parse logs with Filebeat, Metricbeat, and Elastic Agent.
Install the Endpoint Security integration to enable your hosts with threat
detection and prevention via Elastic Endpoint.

==== Observe your data

Get logs, metrics, and uptime data into the Elastic Stack.
Integrations are available for popular services and platforms,
such as Nginx, AWS, and MongoDB,
and generic input types like log files.
Refer to {observability-guide}/observability-introduction.html[What is Elastic Observability] for more information.

==== Search your data
Discover, extract, and index your web content into App Search engines using the
{app-search-ref}/web-crawler.html[Enterprise Search web crawler].
Search across Google Drive, GitHub, Salesforce, and many other web services using
{workplace-search-ref}/workplace-search-content-sources.html[Workplace Search content sources].

=== Add sample data

Sample data sets come with sample visualizations, dashboards, and more to help you
explore {kib} before you ingest or upload your own data.

. On the home page, click *Try sample data*.

. Click *Add data* for the type of data that you want to add.

[[upload-data-kibana]]
=== Upload a file

If you have a log file or delimited CSV, TSV, or JSON file, you can upload it,
view its fields and metrics, and optionally import it into {es}.

NOTE: The upload feature is not intended for use as part of a repeated production
process, but rather for the initial exploration of your data.

Required privileges:

* `Data Views Management: All` {kib} feature privileges
* `all` {kib} privileges for *Discover*
* `manage_pipeline` or `manage_ingest_pipelines` cluster privilege
* `create`, `create_index`, `manage`, and `read` index privileges for the index

To upload a file:

. On the home page, click **Upload a file**.

. Drop your file on the target.
+
By default, you can upload a file up to 100 MB. This value is configurable up to 1 GB in
<<fileupload-maxfilesize,Advanced Settings>>.

. To upload a file with geospatial
data, refer to <<import-geospatial-data,Import geospatial data>>.

=== What's next?

Now that you added data to the Elastic Stack, take your investigation
to a deeper level. Use <<discover, **Discover**>> to quickly gain insight to your data:
search and filter your data, get information about the structure of the fields,
and present your findings in a visualization.
