== Add an integration

The best way to add data to the Elastic Stack is to use one of our many integrations.
Alternatively, you can add a sample data set or upload a file.

=== Integrations

Integrations are a way to stream in logs, metrics, traces,
content, and more from your apps, endpoints, infrastructure, cloud, network,
workplace tools, and other common sources in your ecosystem. All
integrations are available in a single view, and
{kib} guides you there from the Welcome screen and home page. Start
with one of our promoted integrations, or browse or search for a specific integration.

The *Integrations* view shows Elastic Agent integrations when the integration is generally available (GA).
If it is not GA,
the view defaults to Beats integrations. To use a specific
Beats integration, use the control on the bottom left to filter for it.

Some common integrations follow:

* *Enterprise Search integrations.*. Integrations for App Search enable you to search your application with APIs, search your JSON data,
and add search to your website.
For Workplace Search, you can search your files and folders, email, project workflow, organizational content,
and more.
For a custom search, click *View deployment details* and fill in the required information.

* *Observability integrations.* Integrations are available for popular services and platforms, like Nginx, AWS, and MongoDB,
as well as many generic input types like log files.

* *Security integrations.*  Integrations help you protect agains security threats.  For example, the osquery host management integration enables you to use osquery results
to address cyber threats without the complexity or cost of a separate management layer.

=== Add sample data

Sample data sets come with sample visualizations, dashboards, and more to help you
explore {kib} before you ingest or upload your own data.

. On the home page, click *Try sample data*.

. Click *Add data* for the type of data that you want to add.

=== Upload a file

If you have a log file or delimited CSV, TSV, or JSON file, you can upload it,
view its fields and metrics, and optionally import it into {es}.

NOTE: The upload feature is not intended for use as part of a repeated production
process, but rather for the initial exploration of your data.

Required privileges:

* `Data Views Management: All` {kib} feature privileges
* `all` {kib} privileges for *Discover*
* `manage_pipeline` or `manage_ingest_pipelines` cluster privilege
* `create`, `create_index`, `manage`, and `read` index privileges for the index

To upload a file:

. On the home page, click **Upload a file**.

. Drop your file on the target.
+
By default, you can upload a file up to 100 MB. This value is configurable up to 1 GB in
<<fileupload-maxfilesize,Advanced Settings>>.

. To upload a file with geospatial
data, refer to <<import-geospatial-data,Import geospatial data>>.

=== What's next?

Now that data is streaming into the Elastic Stack, take your investigation
to a deeper level. Use <<discover, **Discover**>> to quickly gain insight to your data:
search and filter your data, get information about the structure of the fields,
and present your findings in a visualization.
