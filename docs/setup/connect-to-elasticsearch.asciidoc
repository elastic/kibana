* Add data using an Elastic Agent
* Upload a file

If you're not ready to use your own data, you can add a <<get-started, sample data set>>
to give {kib} a test drive.

===  Add data tutorials

These tutorials guide you through installing and configuring a
Beats data shipper to collect metrics, logs, security events, and application data and send it to {es}.
You can then use the pre-built dashboards to explore and analyze the data.

If a tutorial doesnâ€™t exist for your data, go to the {beats-ref}/beats-reference.html[Beats overview]
to learn about other data shippers in the Beats family.

===  Add an Elatic Agent

beta[]

Fleet is a single, unified way to collect logs and metrics from systems
and services across your organization. You don't have to install multiple
Beats and other agents, making easier to deploy policies across your infrastructure.

[[upload-data-kibana]]
=== Upload a file

experimental[]

To visualize data in a CSV, JSON, or log file, you can upload it using the File
Data Visualizer. On the home page, click *Upload a file*, and
then drag your file into the *File Data Visualizer*.
You can upload a file up to 100 MB. This value is configurable up to 1 GB in
<<kibana-ml-settings, Advanced Settings>>.

The File Data Visualizer uses the {ref}/ml-find-file-structure.html[find_file_structure API] to analyze
the uploaded file and to suggest ingest pipelines and mappings for your data.

NOTE: This feature is not intended for use as part of a
repeated production process, but rather for the initial exploration of your data.

To visualize geospatial data in a point or shape file, use the <<import-geospatial-data, GeoJSON Upload>>
feature in *Maps*.

=== Or, load your data yourself

You can also index your data into Elasticsearch with REST APIs or client libraries.
After you add your data, you'll need to create an <<index-patterns,index pattern>>.
