== Add data

The best way to add data to the Elastic Stack is to use one of our many integrations,
which are pre-packaged assets that are available for a wide array of popular
services and platforms. With integrations, you can add monitoring for logs and
metrics, protect systems from security threats, and more.

All integrations are available in a single view on the **Integrations** page.

NOTE: When an integration is available for both
{fleet-guide}/beats-agent-comparison.html[Elastic Agent and Beats],
the *Integrations* view defaults to the
Elastic Agent integration, if it is generally available (GA).
To show a
Beats integration, use the filter below the side navigation.

=== Add data with Elastic solutions

A good place to start is with one of our Elastic solutions, which
offer experiences for common use cases.

* *Elastic connectors and crawler.*
** Create searchable mirrors of your data in Sharepoint Online, S3, Google Drive, and many other web services using our open code {ref}/es-connectors.html[Elastic connectors].
** Discover, extract, and index your web content into {es} using the
{enterprise-search-ref}/crawler.html[Elastic web crawler].


* *Elastic Observability.*
Get logs, metrics, traces, and uptime data into the Elastic Stack.
Integrations are available for popular services and platforms,
such as Nginx, AWS, and MongoDB,
and generic input types like log files.
Refer to {observability-guide}/observability-introduction.html[Elastic Observability]
for more information.

* *Endpoint Security.*
Protect your hosts and send logs, metrics, and endpoint security data
to Elastic Security.
Refer to {security-guide}/ingest-data.html[Ingest data to Elastic Security]
for more information.

=== Add data with programming languages

Add any data to the Elastic Stack using a programming language,
such as JavaScript, Java, Python, and Ruby.
Details for each programming language library that Elastic provides are in the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html[{es} Client documentation].

If you are running {kib} on our hosted {es} Service,
click *Connection details* on the *Integrations* view
to verify your {es} endpoint and Cloud ID, and create API keys for integration.
Alternatively, the *Connection details* are also accessible through the top bar help menu.

=== Add sample data

Sample data sets come with sample visualizations, dashboards, and more to help you
explore {kib} before you add your own data.
In the *Integrations* view, search for *Sample Data*, and then add the type of
data you want.

=== Upload a data file

You can upload files, view their fields and metrics, and optionally import them to {es} with the Data Visualizer. 
In the *Integrations* view, search for *Upload a file*, and then drop your file on the target.

You can upload different file formats for analysis with the Data Visualizer:

File formats supported up to 500 MB:

* CSV
* TSV
* NDJSON
* Log files

File formats supported up to 60 MB:

* PDF
* Microsoft Office files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
* Plain Text (TXT)
* Rich Text (RTF)
* Open Document Format (ODF)

NOTE: The upload feature is not intended for use as part of a repeated production
process, but rather for the initial exploration of your data.

image::images/add-data-fv.png[Uploading a file in {kib}]

The {stack-security-features} provide roles and privileges that control which
users can upload files. To upload a file in {kib} and import it into an {es}
index, you'll need:

* `manage_pipeline` or `manage_ingest_pipelines` cluster privilege
* `create`, `create_index`, `manage`, and `read` index privileges for the index
* `all` {kib} privileges for *Discover* and *Data Views Management*

You can manage your roles, privileges, and spaces in **{stack-manage-app}**.

=== What's next?

To take your investigation
to a deeper level, use <<discover, **Discover**>> and quickly gain insight to your data:
search and filter your data, get information about the structure of the fields,
and analyze your findings in a visualization.
