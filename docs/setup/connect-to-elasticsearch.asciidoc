== Add data to {kib}

The fastest way to add data to {kib} is to use one of the built-in options,
available from the home page.  You can collect data from an app or service
or upload a file that contains your data.  If you're not ready to use your own data,
add a <<get-started, sample data set>> and give {kib} a test drive.

===  Add data

Ready to ingest logs, metrics, security, and application data?
Install and configure a Beats data shipper or other module to periodically collect the data
and send it to {es}. You can then use the pre-built dashboards to explore and analyze the data.

=== Add Elastic Agent

beta[] *Elastic Agent* is a centralized way to set up up data integrations.
With the *Fleet* UI, you can add
and manage integrations for popular services and platforms, giving you
an easy way to collect data. The integrations also
ship with dashboards visualizations,
so you can see your data right away.

To get started, refer to
{ingest-guide}/ingest-management-getting-started.html[Quick start: Get logs and metrics into the Elastic Stack].

=== Upload a file

experimental[] If your data is in a CSV, JSON, or log file, you can upload it using the File
Data Visualizer. You can upload a file up to 100 MB. This value is configurable up to 1 GB in
<<kibana-ml-settings, Advanced Settings>>.

NOTE: This feature is not intended for use as part of a
repeated production process, but rather for the initial exploration of your data.

For geospatial data, you can use either the File Data Visualizer or the
GeoJSon Uploader, depending on the format of your data.  See
<<import-geospatial-data, Import geospatial data>> for details.

=== Custom options for loading your data

If the built-in options don't work for you, you can index your
data into Elasticsearch with {ref}/getting-started-index.html[REST APIs]
or https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html[client libraries].
After you add your data, you must create an <<index-patterns,index pattern>> to tell
{kib} where to find the data.
