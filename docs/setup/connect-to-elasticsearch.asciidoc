The best way to add data is to use one of our many integrations.
Alternatively, you add a sample data set or upload a file.

=== Add an integration

Integrations periodically collect logs, metrics, security,
and other application data and send it to {es}.
Each integration provides dashboards and visualizations, so you can quickly get insights into your data.

{kib} automatically guides you to add an integration when it doesn't detect any data.
Alternatively, follow these steps.

. On the home page, click *Add integrations*.

. Select the integration for the type of data that you want to collect.

NOTE: {kib} uses *Elastic Agent* to ingest data. For more information,
refer to
{observability-guide}/ingest-logs-metrics-uptime.html[Ingest logs, metrics, and uptime data with {agent}].

=== Add sample data

Sample data sets come with sample visualizations, dashboards, and more to help you
explore {kib} before you ingest or upload your own data.

. On the home page, click *Try sample data*.

. Click *Add data* for the type of data that you want to add.

[[upload-data-kibana]]
=== Upload a file

If you have a log file or delimited CSV, TSV, or JSON file, you can upload it,
view its fields and metrics, and optionally import it into {es}.

NOTE: The upload feature is not intended for use as part of a repeated production
process, but rather for the initial exploration of your data.

. To upload a file, youâ€™ll need the following privileges,
which you can manage in **{stack-manage-app}**.
* [ ] `Data Views Management: All` {kib} feature privileges
* `all` {kib} privileges for *Discover*
* `manage_pipeline` or `manage_ingest_pipelines` cluster privilege
* `create`, `create_index`, `manage`, and `read` index privileges for the index

. On the home page, click **Upload a file**.

. Drop your file on the target.
+
By default, you can upload a file up to 100 MB. This value is configurable up to 1 GB in
<<fileupload-maxfilesize,Advanced Settings>>.

. To upload a file with geospatial
data, refer to <<import-geospatial-data,Import geospatial data>>.

=== What's next?

Now that data is streaming into the Elastic Stack, take your investigation
to a deeper level. Use <<discover, **Discover**>> to quickly gain insight to your data:
search and filter your data, get information about the structure of the fields,
and present your findings in a visualization.
