== Add your data

To start working with your data in {kib}, use one of the many ingest options,
available from the home page.
You can collect data from an app or service,
or upload a file that contains your data.  If you're not ready to use your own data,
add a sample data set and give {kib} a test drive.

=== Add data

Want to ingest logs, metrics, security, or application data?
Install and configure a Beats data shipper or other module to periodically collect the data
and send it to {es}. You can then use the pre-built dashboards to explore and analyze the data.

=== Add Elastic Agent

*Elastic Agent* is the next generation of
data integration modules, offering
a centralized way to set up your integrations.

With *Fleet*, you can add
and manage integrations for popular services and platforms, providing
an easy way to collect your data, and manage {elastic-agent} installations in standalone or {fleet} mode. The integrations
ship with dashboards and visualizations,
so you can quickly get insights into your data, and {fleet} mode offers several advantages:

* A central place to configure and monitor your {agents}.

* An overview of the data ingest in your {es} cluster.

* Multiple integrations to collect and transform data.

To get started, refer to
{observability-guide}/ingest-logs-metrics-uptime.html[Ingest logs, metrics, and uptime data with {agent}].

[[upload-data-kibana]]
=== Upload a file

If you have a log file or delimited CSV, TSV, or JSON file, you can upload it,
view its fields and metrics, and optionally import it into {es}.

NOTE: This feature is not intended for use as part of a repeated production
process, but rather for the initial exploration of your data.

You can upload a file up to 100 MB. This value is configurable up to 1 GB in
<<fileupload-maxfilesize,Advanced Settings>>. To upload a file with geospatial
data, refer to <<import-geospatial-data,Import geospatial data>>.

image::images/add-data-fv.png[Uploading a file in {kib}]

The {stack-security-features} provide roles and privileges that control which
users can upload files. To upload a file in {kib} and import it into an {es}
index, you'll need:

* `all` {kib} privileges for *Discover*
* `manage_pipeline` or `manage_ingest_pipelines` cluster privilege
* `create`, `create_index`, `manage`, and `read` index privileges for the index

You can manage your roles, privileges, and spaces in **{stack-manage-app}** in
{kib}. For more information, refer to
<<xpack-kibana-role-management,{kib} role management>>.

=== Additional options for loading your data

If the {kib} ingest options don't work for you, you can index your
data into Elasticsearch with {ref}/getting-started-index.html[REST APIs]
or https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html[client libraries].
After you add your data, you're required to create a <<data-views,data view>> to tell
{kib} where to find the data.

* To add data for Elastic Observability, refer to {observability-guide}/add-observability-data.html[Send data to Elasticsearch].
* To add data for Elastic Security, refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/ingest-data.html[Ingest data to Elastic Security].
