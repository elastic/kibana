When you start {es} for the first time, the following security configuration
occurs automatically:

* {ref}/configuring-stack-security.html#stack-security-certificates[Certificates and keys] for TLS are
generated for the transport and HTTP layers.
* The TLS configuration settings are written to `elasticsearch.yml`.
* A password is generated for the `elastic` user.
* An enrollment token is generated for {kib}.

You can then start {kib} and enter the enrollment token to securely connect 
{kib} with {es}. The enrollment token is valid for 30 minutes.
