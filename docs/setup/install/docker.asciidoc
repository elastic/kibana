=== Install Kibana with Docker

Obtaining Kibana for Docker is as simple as issuing a +docker pull+ command
against the Elastic Docker registry.

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

However, version {version} of Kibana has not yet been released, so no Docker
image is currently available for this version.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

The Docker image can be retrieved with the following command:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
--------------------------------------------
docker pull {docker-image}
--------------------------------------------

endif::[]
