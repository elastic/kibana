==== Run {kib} from the command line

Kibana can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\kibana.bat
--------------------------------------------

By default, Kibana runs in the foreground, prints its logs to `STDOUT`,
and can be stopped by pressing *Ctrl-C*.
