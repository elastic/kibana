If this is the first time you're starting {kib}, this command generates a 
unique link in your terminal to enroll your {kib} instance with {es}.

. In your terminal, click the generated link to open {kib} in your browser.

. In your browser, paste the enrollment token that was generated in the terminal 
when you started {es}, and then click the button to connect your {kib} instance with {es}.

. Log in to {kib} as the `elastic` user with the password that was 
generated when you started {es}.

[NOTE]
====
If you need to reset the password for the `elastic` user or other
built-in users, run the {ref}/reset-password.html[`elasticsearch-reset-password`] tool. To generate new enrollment tokens for 
{kib} or {es} nodes, run the
{ref}/create-enrollment-token.html[`elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token`] tool.
These tools are available in the {es} `bin` directory.
