["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
--------------------------------------------
curl -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-{version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
curl https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-{version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512 | shasum -a 512 -c - <1>
tar -xzf kibana-{version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd kibana-{version}-linux-x86_64/ <2>

<1> Compares the SHA of the downloaded `.tar.gz` archive and the published checksum, which should output
    `kibana-{version}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz: OK`.

[[install-darwin64]]
==== Download and install the Darwin package

[IMPORTANT]
.macOS Gatekeeper warnings
====
Apple's rollout of stricter notarization requirements affected the notarization
of the {version} {kib} artifacts. If macOS Catalina displays a dialog when you
first run {kib} that interrupts it, you will need to take an action to allow it
to run.

To prevent Gatekeeper checks on the {kib} files, run the following command on the
downloaded `.tar.gz` archive or the directory to which was extracted:
[source,sh]
----
xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine <archive-or-directory>
----

Alternatively, you can add a security override if a Gatekeeper popup appears by
following the instructions in the _How to open an app that hasnâ€™t been notarized
or is from an unidentified developer_ section of
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491[Safely open apps on your Mac].

[[targz-configuring]]
==== Configure {kib} via the config file

Kibana loads its configuration from the `$KIBANA_HOME/config/kibana.yml`
file by default.  The format of this config file is explained in
{kibana-ref}/settings.html[Configuring Kibana].


[[targz-layout]]
==== Directory layout of `.tar.gz` archives

The `.tar.gz` packages are entirely self-contained. All files and directories
are, by default, contained within `$KIBANA_HOME` -- the directory created when
unpacking the archive.

This is very convenient because you don't have to create any directories to
start using Kibana, and uninstalling Kibana is as easy as removing the
`$KIBANA_HOME` directory.  However, it is advisable to change the default
locations of the config and data directories so that you do not delete
important data later on.
