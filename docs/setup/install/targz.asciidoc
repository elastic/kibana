[[targz-running]]
==== Running Kibana from the command line

Kibana can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
./bin/kibana
--------------------------------------------

By default, Kibana runs in the foreground, prints its logs to the
standard output (`stdout`), and can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C`.


[[targz-configuring]]
==== Configuring Kibana on the command line

Kibana loads its configuration from the `$KIBANA_HOME/config/kibana.yml`
file by default.  The format of this config file is explained in
<<settings>>.


[[targz-layout]]
==== Directory layout of `.tar.gz` archives

The `.tar.gz` packages are entirely self-contained. All files and directories
are, by default, contained within `$KIBANA_HOME` -- the directory created when
unpacking the archive.

This is very convenient because you don't have to create any directories to
start using Kibana, and uninstalling Kibana is as easy as removing the
`$KIBANA_HOME` directory.  However, it is advisable to change the default
locations of the config and data directories so that you do not delete
important data later on.
