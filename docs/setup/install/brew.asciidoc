=== Install {kib} on macOS with Homebrew

Elastic publishes Homebrew formulae so you can install {kib} with the https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] package manager.

To install with Homebrew, you first need to tap the Elastic Homebrew repository:

Once you've tapped the Elastic Homebrew repo, you can use `brew install` to
install the **lastest version** of {kib}:

brew install elastic/tap/kibana-full
