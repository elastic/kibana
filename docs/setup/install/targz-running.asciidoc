==== Running Kibana from the command line

Kibana can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
./bin/kibana
--------------------------------------------

By default, Kibana runs in the foreground, prints its logs to the
standard output (`stdout`), and can be stopped by pressing *Ctrl-C*.
