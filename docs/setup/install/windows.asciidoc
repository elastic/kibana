ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

Download the `.zip` windows archive for Kibana v{version} from
https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-{version}-windows-x86_64.zip

Unzip it with your favourite unzip tool. This will create a folder called
kibana-{version}-windows-x86_64, which we will refer to as `$KIBANA_HOME`. In a
terminal window, `CD` to the `$KIBANA_HOME` directory, for instance:


["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------
CD c:\kibana-{version}-windows-x86_64
----------------------------

Alternatively, you can download the following package, which contains only 
features that are available under the Apache 2.0 license:
https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-oss-{version}-windows-x86_64.zip

[[windows-configuring]]
==== Configuring Kibana via config file

Kibana loads its configuration from the `$KIBANA_HOME/config/kibana.yml`
file by default.  The format of this config file is explained in
{kibana-ref}/settings.html[Configuring Kibana].

[[windows-layout]]
==== Directory layout of `.zip` archive

The `.zip` package is entirely self-contained. All files and directories are,
by default, contained within `$KIBANA_HOME` -- the directory created when
unpacking the archive.

This is very convenient because you don't have to create any directories to
start using Kibana, and uninstalling Kibana is as easy as removing the
`$KIBANA_HOME` directory.  However, it is advisable to change the default
locations of the config and data directories so that you do not delete
important data later on.
