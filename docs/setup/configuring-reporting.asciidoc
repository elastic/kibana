== Configure reporting in {kib}

For security, you grant users access to the {report-features} and secure the reporting endpoints
with TLS/SSL encryption. Additionally, you can install graphical packages into the operating system
to enable the {kib} server to have screenshotting capabilities.

[[install-reporting-packages]]
=== Install the reporting packages

Make sure the {kib} server operating system has the appropriate packages installed for the distribution.

If you are using RHEL operating systems, install the following packages:

* `ipa-gothic-fonts`
* `xorg-x11-fonts-100dpi`
* `xorg-x11-fonts-75dpi`
* `xorg-x11-utils`
* `xorg-x11-fonts-cyrillic`
* `xorg-x11-fonts-Type1`
* `xorg-x11-fonts-misc`
* `fontconfig`
* `freetype`

If you are using Ubuntu/Debian systems, install the following packages:

* `fonts-liberation`
* `libfontconfig1`
* `libnss3`

If the system is missing dependencies, a screenshot report job may fail in a non-deterministic way. {kib} runs a self-test at server startup, and
if it encounters errors, logs them in the Console. The error message does not include
information about why Chromium failed to run. The most common error message is `Error: connect ECONNREFUSED`, which indicates
that {kib} could not connect to the Chromium process.

To troubleshoot the problem, start the {kib} server with environment variables that tell Chromium to print verbose logs. For more information, refer to <<reporting-troubleshooting-puppeteer-debug-logs>>.

[[grant-user-access]]
=== Grant users access to reporting
When security is enabled, you grant users access to {report-features} with <<kibana-privileges, {kib} application privileges>>, which allow you to create custom roles that control the spaces and applications where users generate reports.

. Enable application privileges in Reporting. To enable, turn off the default user access control features in `kibana.yml`:
+
[source,yaml]
------------------------------------
xpack.reporting.roles.enabled: false
------------------------------------
+
NOTE: If you use the default settings, you can still create a custom role that grants reporting privileges. The default role is `reporting_user`. This behavior is being deprecated and does not allow application-level access controls for {report-features}, and does not allow API keys or authentication tokens to authorize report generation. Refer to <<reporting-advanced-settings, reporting security settings>> for information and caveats about the deprecated access control features.

. Create the reporting role.

.. Open the main menu, then click *Stack Management*.

.. Click *Roles > Create role*.

. Specify the role settings.

.. Enter the *Role name*. For example, `custom_reporting_user`.

.. Specify the *Indices* and *Privileges*.
+
Access to data is an index-level privilege. For each index that contains the data you want to include in reports, add a line, then give each index `read` and `view_index_metadata` privileges.
+
For more information, refer to {ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges].

. Add the {kib} privileges.

.. Click *Add Kibana privilege*.

.. Select one or more *Spaces*.

.. Click *Customize*, then click *Analytics*.

.. For each application, select *All*, or to customize the privileges, select *Read* and *Customize sub-feature privileges*.
+
NOTE: If you have a Basic license, sub-feature privileges are unavailable. For details, check out <<grant-user-access-basic>>.
[role="screenshot"]
image::user/reporting/images/kibana-privileges-with-reporting.png["Kibana privileges with Reporting options, Gold or higher license"]
+
NOTE: If the *Reporting* options for application features are unavailable, and the cluster license is higher than Basic, contact your administrator, or <<reporting-advanced-settings,check that `xpack.reporting.roles.enabled` is set to `false` in kibana.yml>>.

.. Click *Add {kib} privilege*.

. Click *Create role*.

. Assign the reporting role to a user.

.. Open the main menu, then click *Stack Management*.

.. Click *Users*, then click the user you want to assign the reporting role to.

.. From the *Roles* dropdown, select *custom_reporting_user*.

.. Click *Update user*.

Granting the privilege to generate reports also grants the user the privilege to view their reports in *Stack Management > Reporting*. Users can only access their own reports.

[[reporting-roles-user-api]]
==== Grant access with the role API
With <<grant-user-access, {kib} application privileges>> enabled in Reporting, you can also use the {ref}/security-api-put-role.html[role API] to grant access to the {report-features}, using *All* privileges, or sub-feature privileges.

NOTE: If you have a Basic license, sub-feature privileges are unavailable. For details, check out the API command to grant *All* privileges in <<grant-user-access-basic>>.

Grant users custom Reporting roles, other roles that grant read access to the data in {es}, and at least read access in the applications where users can generate reports.

[[grant-user-access-basic]]
=== Grant users access with a Basic license

With a Basic license, you can grant users access with custom roles to {report-features} with <<kibana-privileges, {kib} application privileges>>. However, with a Basic license, sub-feature privileges are unavailable. <<grant-user-access,Create a role>>, then select *All* privileges for the applications where users can create reports.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/reporting/images/kibana-privileges-with-reporting-basic.png["Kibana privileges with Reporting options, Basic license"]

With a Basic license, sub-feature application privileges are unavailable, but you can use the {ref}/security-api-put-role.html[role API] to grant access to CSV {report-features}:

[source, sh]
---------------------------------------------------------------
PUT localhost:5601/api/security/role/custom_reporting_user
{
  "elasticsearch": { "cluster": [], "indices": [], "run_as": [] },
  "kibana": [
    {
      "base": [],
      "feature": {
        "dashboard": [ "all" ], <1>
        "discover": [ "all" ], <2>
      },
      "spaces": [ "*" ]
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {} // optional
}
---------------------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

<1> Grants access to generate CSV reports from saved searches in *Discover*.
<2> Grants access to download CSV reports from saved search panels in *Dashboard*.

[float]
[[grant-user-access-external-provider]]
==== Grant access using an external provider

If you are using an external identity provider, such as LDAP or Active Directory, you can assign roles to individual users or groups of users. Role mappings are configured in {ref}/mapping-roles.html[`config/role_mapping.yml`].

For example, assign the `kibana_admin` and `reporting_user` roles to the Bill Murray user:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kibana_admin:
  - "cn=Bill Murray,dc=example,dc=com"
reporting_user:
  - "cn=Bill Murray,dc=example,dc=com"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[securing-reporting]]
=== Secure the reporting endpoints

To automatically generate reports with {watcher}, you must configure {watcher} to trust the {kib} server certificate.

. Enable {stack-security-features} on your {es} cluster. For more information, see {ref}/security-getting-started.html[Getting started with security].

. Configure TLS/SSL encryption for the {kib} server. For more information, see <<configuring-tls>>.

. Specify the {kib} server CA certificate chain in `elasticsearch.yml`:
+
--
If you are using your own CA to sign the {kib} server certificate, then you need to specify the CA certificate chain in {es} to properly establish trust in TLS connections between {watcher} and {kib}. If your CA certificate chain is contained in a PKCS #12 trust store, specify it like so:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.http.ssl.truststore.path: "/path/to/your/truststore.p12"
xpack.http.ssl.truststore.type: "PKCS12"
xpack.http.ssl.truststore.password: "optional decryption password"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Otherwise, if your CA certificate chain is in PEM format, specify it like so:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.http.ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/path/to/your/cacert1.pem", "/path/to/your/cacert2.pem"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For more information, see {ref}/notification-settings.html#ssl-notification-settings[the {watcher} HTTP TLS/SSL Settings].
--

. Add one or more users who have access to the {report-features}.
+
Once you've enabled SSL for {kib}, all requests to the reporting endpoints must include valid credentials.
