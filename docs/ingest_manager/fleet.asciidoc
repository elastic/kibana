Before using Fleet you need to configure host settings for Kibana and Elasticsearch. This could be done using:
* In your kibana config file by setting `xpack.ingestManager.fleet.elasticsearch.host` and `xpack.ingestManager.fleet.kibana.host`
* From Kibana UI in the Ingest Manager plugin global settings page.

=== Requirements

To be able to run Fleet, Kibana and Elasticsearch should use TLS and API key should be enabled on Elasticsearch. In some scenario you could have to disable the check of TLS requirements this can be done by adding `xpack.ingestManager.fleet.tlsCheckDisabled: true` to your Kibana configuration.
