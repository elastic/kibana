The `String` field formatter can apply the following transformations to the field's contents:

* Convert to lowercase
* Convert to uppercase
* Convert to title case
* Apply the short dots transformation, which replaces the content before a `.` character with the first character of
that content, as in the following example:

[horizontal]
*Original*:: *Becomes*
`com.organizations.project.ClassName`:: `c.o.p.ClassName`
