=== Test connectors

You can test connectors with the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or
as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}. For example:

Jira actions have the following configuration properties.

Priority:: The priority of the incident.
Labels:: The labels for the incident.
Title:: A title for the issue, used for searching the contents of the knowledge base.
