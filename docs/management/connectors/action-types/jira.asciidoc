[[define-jira-ui]]
=== Create connectors in {kib}

You can create connectors in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*
or as needed when you're creating a rule. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/jira-connector.png[Jira connector]

==== Connector configuration

Jira connectors have the following configuration properties:

Name::      The name of the connector.
URL::       Jira instance URL.
Project key:: Jira project key.
Email::  The account email for HTTP Basic authentication.
API token::  Jira API authentication token for HTTP Basic authentication.

[[preconfigured-jira-configuration]]
=== Create preconfigured connectors

If you are running {kib} on-prem, you can define connectors by
adding `xpack.actions.preconfigured` settings to your `kibana.yml` file.
For example:

[source,text]
--
xpack.actions.preconfigured:
  my-jira:
    name: preconfigured-jira-connector-type
    actionTypeId: .jira
    config:
      apiUrl: https://elastic.atlassian.net
      projectKey: ES
    secrets:
      email: testuser
      apiToken: tokenkeystorevalue
--

Config defines information for the connector type.

`apiUrl`:: An address that corresponds to *URL*.
`projectKey`:: A key that corresponds to *Project Key*.

Secrets defines sensitive information for the connector type.

`email`:: A string that corresponds to *Email*.
`apiToken`:: A string that corresponds to *API Token*. Should be stored in the <<creating-keystore, {kib} keystore>>.

=== Test connectors

You can test connectors with the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or

Jira actions have the following configuration properties.

Issue type:: The type of the issue.
Priority:: The priority of the incident.

[[jira-connector-networking-configuration]]
