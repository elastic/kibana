or as needed when you're creating a rule. For example:

=== Create preconfigured connectors

If you are running {kib} on-prem, you can define connectors by
adding `xpack.actions.preconfigured` settings to your `kibana.yml` file.
For example:

[source,text]
--
xpack.actions.preconfigured:
  my-swimlane:
    name: preconfigured-swimlane-connector-type
    actionTypeId: .swimlane
    config:
      apiUrl: https://elastic.swimlaneurl.us
      appId: app-id
      mappings:
        alertIdConfig:
          fieldType: text
          id: agp4s
          key: alert-id
          name: Alert ID 
        caseIdConfig:
          fieldType: text
          id: ae1mi
          key: case-id
          name: Case ID
        caseNameConfig:
          fieldType: text
          id: anxnr
          key: case-name
          name: Case Name
        commentsConfig:
          fieldType: comments
          id: au18d
          key: comments
          name: Comments
        descriptionConfig:
          fieldType: text 
          id: ae1gd
          key: description 
          name: Description 
        ruleNameConfig:
          fieldType: text
          id: avfsl
          key: rule-name
          name: Rule Name
        severityConfig:
          fieldType: text
          id: a71ik
          key: severity
          name: severity
    secrets:
      apiToken: tokenkeystorevalue

Swimlane actions have the following configuration properties.

Comments:: Additional information for the client, such as how to troubleshoot the issue.
