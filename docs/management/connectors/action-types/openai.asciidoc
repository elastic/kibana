:frontmatter-description: Add a connector that can send requests to an OpenAI provider.
:frontmatter-tags-products: [kibana] 
:frontmatter-tags-content-type: [how-to] 
:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [configure]


The OpenAI connector uses https://github.com/axios/axios[axios] to send a POST request to an OpenAI provider, either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI. The connector uses the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> to send the request.

=== Test connectors

You can test connectors with the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or
as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/gen-ai-params-test.png[OpenAI params test]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

The OpenAI actions have the following configuration properties.

[source,text]
--
{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",

[[openai-connector-networking-configuration]]
=== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.

[[openai-connector-token-dashboard]]
=== Token usage dashboard

Once you've created a OpenAI connector, you can monitor its token usage using the *OpenAI Token Usage* dashboard. Select the connector in *{stack-manage-app}* > *{connectors-ui}* to view its details, then click the *View OpenAI Usage Dashboard for "_<Name>_" Connector* link to open the dashboard.

NOTE: To view the dashboard, you need at least `read` and `view_index_metadata` privileges for the `.kibana-event-log-*` index and the `Read` feature privilege for {kib}. You can set up a role with these minimum privileges and assign it to non-admin users who need to view this dashboard.
