[[email-action-type]]
=== Email connector and action
++++
<titleabbrev>Email</titleabbrev>
++++

The email connector uses the SMTP protocol to send mail messages, using an integration of https://nodemailer.com/[Nodemailer]. An exception is Microsoft Exchange, which uses HTTP protocol for sending emails, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-sendmail[Send mail]. Email message text is sent as both plain text and html text.

NOTE: For emails to have a footer with a link back to {kib}, set the <<server-publicBaseUrl, `server.publicBaseUrl`>> configuration setting.

[[email-connector-configuration]]
==== Connector configuration

Email connectors have the following configuration properties.

Name::      The name of the connector. The name is used to identify a  connector in the management UI connector listing, or in the connector list when configuring an action.
Sender::    The from address for all emails sent with this connector. This must be specified in `user@host-name` format. See the https://nodemailer.com/message/addresses/[Nodemailer address documentation] for more information.
Service::   The name of the email service. If `service` is one of Nodemailer's https://nodemailer.com/smtp/well-known/[well-known email service providers], the `host`, `port`, and `secure` properties are defined with the default values and disabled for modification. If `service` is `MS Exchange Server`, the `host`, `port`, and `secure` properties are ignored and `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret` are required instead. If `service` is `other`, the `host` and `port` properties must be defined.
Host::      Host name of the service provider. If you are using the <<action-settings, `xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure this hostname is added to the allowed hosts.
Port::      The port to connect to on the service provider.
Secure::    If true, the connection will use TLS when connecting to the service provider. Refer to the https://nodemailer.com/smtp/#tls-options[Nodemailer TLS documentation] for more information.  If not true, the connection will initially connect over TCP, then attempt to switch to TLS via the SMTP STARTTLS command.
Tenant ID:: The directory tenant that the application plans to operate against, in GUID format.
Client ID:: The application ID that is assigned to your app, in GUID format. You can find this information in the portal where you registered your app.
Client Secret:: The client secret that you generated for your app in the app registration portal. The client secret must be URL-encoded before being sent. The Basic auth pattern of providing credentials in the Authorization header, per https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1[RFC 6749], is also supported.
Require authentication:: If true, a username and password for login type authentication must be provided.
Username::  Username for login type authentication.
Password::  Password for login type authentication.

 my-email:
   name: preconfigured-email-connector-type
   actionTypeId: .email
   config:
     service: other
     from: testsender@test.com
     host: validhostname
     port: 8080
     secure: false
   secrets:
     user: testuser
     password: passwordkeystorevalue
--

Config defines information for the connector type.

`service`:: The name of the email service. If `service` is `elastic_cloud` (for Elastic Cloud notifications) or one of Nodemailer's https://nodemailer.com/smtp/well-known/[well-known email service providers], the `host`, `port`, and `secure` properties are ignored. If `service` is `other`,  the `host` and `port` properties must be defined. For more information on the `gmail` service value, refer to https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/[Nodemailer Gmail documentation]. If `service` is `exchange_server`, the `tenantId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret` properties are required instead of `host` and `port`.
`from`:: An email address that corresponds to *Sender*.
`host`:: A string that corresponds to *Host*.
`port`:: A number that corresponds to *Port*.
`secure`:: A boolean that corresponds to *Secure*.
`hasAuth`:: A boolean that corresponds to *Requires authentication*. If `true`, this connector will require values for `user` and `password` inside the secrets configuration. Defaults to `true`.
`tenantId`:: A GUID format value that corresponds to *Tenant ID*, which is a part of OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Authentication. 
`clientId`:: A GUID format value that corresponds to *Client ID*, which is a part of OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Authentication.

Secrets defines sensitive information for the connector type.

`user`:: A string that corresponds to *Username*. Required if `hasAuth` is set to `true`.
`password`:: A string that corresponds to *Password*. Should be stored in the <<creating-keystore, {kib} keystore>>. Required if `hasAuth` is set to `true`.
`clientSecret`:: A string that corresponds to *Client Secret*. Should be stored in the <<creating-keystore, {kib} keystore>>. Required if `service` is set to `exchange_server`, which uses OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Authentication.

[[email-action-configuration]]
==== Action configuration

Email actions have the following configuration properties.

To, CC, BCC::    Each item is a list of addresses. Addresses can be specified in `user@host-name` format, or in `name <user@host-name>` format. One of To, CC, or BCC must contain an entry.
Subject::       The subject line of the email.
Message::       The message text of the email. Markdown format is supported.

[float]
[[configuring-email]]
==== Configuring email accounts for well-known services

The email connector can send email using many popular SMTP email services and the Microsoft Exchange Graph API.

For more information about configuring the email connector to work with different email systems, refer to:

* <<elasticcloud>>
* <<gmail>>
* <<outlook>>
* <<amazon-ses>>
* <<exchange>>

For other email servers, you can check the list of well-known services that Nodemailer supports in the JSON file https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/blob/master/lib/well-known/services.json[well-known/services.json].  The properties of the objects in those files &mdash; `host`, `port`, and `secure` &mdash; correspond to the same email connector configuration properties.  A missing `secure` property in the "well-known/services.json" file is considered `false`.  Typically, `port: 465` uses `secure: true`, and `port: 25` and `port: 587` use `secure: false`.

[float]
[[elasticcloud]]
==== Sending email from Elastic Cloud

IMPORTANT: These instructions require you to link:{cloud}/ec-watcher.html#ec-watcher-whitelist[allowlist] the email addresses that notifications get sent.

Use the following connector settings to send email from Elastic Cloud: 

Sender::
`noreply@watcheralert.found.io`

Service::
`elastic_cloud`

Host::
`dockerhost`

Port::
`10025`

Secure::
Toggle off

Authentication::

[float]
[[gmail]]
==== Sending email from Gmail

Use the following email connector configuration to send email from the
https://mail.google.com[Gmail] SMTP service:

[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------
  config:
    service: gmail
    // `host`, `port` and `secure` have the following default values and do not need to set: 
    // host: smtp.gmail.com
    // port: 465
    // secure: true
  secrets:
    user: <username>
    password: <password>
--------------------------------------------------

If you get an authentication error that indicates that you need to continue the
sign-in process from a web browser when the action attempts to send email, you need
to configure Gmail to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en[allow
less secure apps to access your account].

If two-step verification is enabled for your account, you must generate and use
a unique App Password to send email from {kib}. See
https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en[Sign in using App Passwords]
for more information.

[float]
[[outlook]]
==== Sending email from Outlook.com

Use the following email connector configuration to send email from the
https://www.outlook.com/[Outlook.com] SMTP service:

[source,text]

config:
    service: outlook365
    // `host`, `port` and `secure` have the following default values and do not need to set: 
    // host: smtp.office365.com
    // port: 587
    // secure: false
secrets:
    user: <email.address>
    password: <password>
--------------------------------------------------

When sending emails, you must provide a `from` address, either as the default 
in your connector configuration or as part of the email action in the rule.

NOTE:   You must use a unique App Password if two-step verification is enabled.

[[exchange-basic-auth]]
==== Sending email from Microsoft Exchange with Basic Authentication

deprecated:[This Microsoft Exchange configuration is deprecated in 7.16.0, and will be removed later, because Microsoft is deprecating https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/exchange-online-basic-auth-deprecated [Basic Authentication]:

[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------
config:
    service: other
    host: <your exchange server>
    port: 465
    secure: true
    from: <email address of service account> <1>
secrets:
    user: <email address of service account> <2>
    password: <password>
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Some organizations configure Exchange to validate that the `from` field is a
    valid local email account.
<2> Many organizations support use of your email address as your username.
    Check with your system administrator if you receive
    authentication-related failures.

To prepare for the removal of Basic Auth, you must update all existing Microsoft Exchange connectors with the new configuration based on the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow[OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Authentication].
