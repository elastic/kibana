[[opsgenie-connector-configuration]]
==== Connector configuration

Opsgenie connectors have the following configuration properties.

Name:: The name of the connector. The name is used to identify a connector in the management UI connector listing, or in the connector list when configuring an action.
URL:: The Opsgenie URL. For example, https://api.opsgenie.com or https://api.eu.opsgenie.com.
+
NOTE: If you are using the <<action-settings, `xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure the hostname is added to the allowed hosts.
API Key::   The Opsgenie API authentication key for HTTP Basic authentication. For more details about generating Opsgenie API keys, refer to https://support.atlassian.com/opsgenie/docs/create-a-default-api-integration/[Opsgenie documentation].

[[opgenie-connector-networking-configuration]]
==== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.

[[opsgenie-action-configuration]]
==== Action configuration

The Opsgenie connector supports two types of actions: Create alert and Close alert. The properties supported for each action are different because Opsgenie defines different properties for each operation.

When testing the Opsgenie connector, choose the appropriate action from the selector. Each action has different properties that can be configured.

Action:: Select *Create alert* to configure the actions that occur when a rule's conditions are met. Select *Close alert* to define the recovery actions that occur when a rule's conditions are no longer met.

==== Configure an Opsgenie account

After obtaining an Opsgenie instance, configure the API integration. For details, refer to the https://support.atlassian.com/opsgenie/docs/create-a-default-api-integration/[Opsgenie documentation].

If you're using a free trial, go to the `Teams` dashboard and select the appropriate team.

image::management/connectors/images/opsgenie-teams.png[Opsgenie teams dashboard]

Select the `Integrations` menu item, then select `Add integration`.

image::management/connectors/images/opsgenie-integrations.png[Opsgenie teams integrations]

Search for `API` and select the `API` integration.

image::management/connectors/images/opsgenie-add-api-integration.png[Opsgenie API integration]

Configure the integration and ensure you record the `API Key`. This key will be used to populate the `API Key` field when creating the Kibana Opsgenie connector. Click `Save Integration` after you finish configuring the integration.
