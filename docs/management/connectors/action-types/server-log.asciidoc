=== Test connectors

You can test connectors with the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or
as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}. For example:

[role="screenshot"]

// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

Server log connector actions contain a message and a log level, which defaults to `info`. Valid log level values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`,
and `fatal`.
