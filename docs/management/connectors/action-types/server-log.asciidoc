A server log connector writes an entry to the {kib} server log.

You can create a server log connectors in {kib} or by using the
<<create-connector-api,create connector API>>. If you are running {kib}
on-prem, you can also create preconfigured server log connectors.

=== Create connectors in {kib}

You can create connectors in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*
or as needed when you're creating a rule. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/serverlog-connector.png[Server log connector]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

==== Connector configuration

Server log connectors do not have any configuration properties other than a name.

[[preconfigured-server-log-configuration]]
=== Create preconfigured connectors

If you are running {kib} on-prem, you can define connectors by adding
`xpack.actions.preconfigured` settings to your `kibana.yml` file. For example:

[source,text]
--
xpack.actions.preconfigured:
  my-server-log:
    name: preconfigured-server-log-connector-type
    actionTypeId: .server-log
--

For more information, go to <<pre-configured-connectors>>.

=== Test connectors

You can test connectors with the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or
as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/serverlog-params-test.png[Server log connector test]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

Server log connector actions contain a message and a log level, which defaults to `info`. Valid log level values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`,
and `fatal`.
