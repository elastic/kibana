A server log connector writes an entry to the {kib} server log.

You can create a server log connector in {kib} or by using the
<<create-connector-api,create connector API>>. If you are running {kib}
on-prem, you can also create a preconfigured server log connector.

=== Create a connector in {kib}

You can create a server log connector in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*
or as needed when you're creating a rule. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/serverlog-connector.png[Server log connector]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

[[preconfigured-server-log-configuration]]
=== Create a preconfigured connector

If you are running {kib} on-prem, you can define a server log connector by
adding `xpack.actions.preconfigured` settings to your `kibana.yml` file.
For example:

[source,text]
--
xpack.actions.preconfigured:
  my-server-log:
    name: preconfigured-server-log-connector-type
    actionTypeId: .server-log
--

For more information, go to <<pre-configured-connectors>>.

=== Test the connector

You can test your server log connector with the
<<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or as you're creating or editing
the connector in {kib}. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/serverlog-params-test.png[Server log connector test]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

Server log actions have the following properties:

Message::   The message to log.
Level::     The log level of the message: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` or `fatal`. Defaults to `info`.
