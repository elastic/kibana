=== Create connectors in {kib}

You can create connectors in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*
or as needed when you're creating a rule. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/serverlog-connector.png[Server log connector]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

==== Connector configuration

Server log connectors do not have any configuration properties other than a name.

=== Test connectors

You can test connectors as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}.
For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/serverlog-params-test.png[Server log connector test]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

Server log connector actions contain a message and a log level, which defaults to `info`. Valid log level values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`,
and `fatal`.
