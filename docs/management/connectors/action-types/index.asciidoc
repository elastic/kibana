An index connector indexes a document into {es}.

You can create index connectors in {kib} or by using the
<<create-connector-api,create connector API>>. Alternatively, you can use the <<preconfigured-connector-alert-history,preconfigured alert history {es} index connector>>.
If you are running {kib} on-prem, you can also create more preconfigured index
connectors.

=== Create connectors in {kib}

You can create connectors in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*
or as needed when you're creating a rule. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/index-connector.png[Index connector]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

==== Connector configuration

Index connectors must have a name and an {es} index. You can optionally set the time field, which contains the
details about when each alert condition was detected.

[float]
[[preconfigured-index-configuration]]
=== Create preconfigured connectors

If you are running {kib} on-prem, you can define connectors by
adding `xpack.actions.preconfigured` settings to your `kibana.yml` file.
For example:

[source,text]
--
xpack.actions.preconfigured:
  my-index:
    name: preconfigured-index-connector-type
    actionTypeId: .index
    config:
      index: .kibana
      executionTimeField: my-field
--

For more information, go to <<pre-configured-connectors>>.

[[preconfigured-connector-alert-history]]
==== Preconfigured alert history {es} index connector

preview::[]

{kib} offers a preconfigured index connector to facilitate indexing active alert
data into {es}.

To use this connector, set
<<action-settings,`xpack.actions.preconfiguredAlertHistoryEsIndex`>> to `true`.

When you subsequently create rules, you can use the
`Alert history Elasticsearch index (preconfigured)` connector.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/pre-configured-alert-history-connector.png[Select pre-configured alert history connectors]

Documents are indexed using a preconfigured schema that captures the 
<<defining-rules-actions-variables,action variables>> available for the rule. 
By default, these documents are indexed into the `kibana-alert-history-default` 
index, but you can specify a different index. Index names must start with 
`kibana-alert-history-` to take advantage of the preconfigured alert history 
index template.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* To write documents to the preconfigured index, you must have `all` or `write` 
privileges to the `kibana-alert-history-*` indices. Refer to 
<<kibana-role-management>> for more information.
* The `kibana-alert-history-*` indices are not configured to use ILM so they must 
be maintained manually. If the index size grows large, consider using the 
{ref}/docs-delete-by-query.html[delete by query] API to clean up older documents 
in the index.

=== Test connectors

You can test connectors with the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or
as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/index-params-test.png[Index params test]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

Index connector actions contain a document in JSON format. For example, if you
have an index with the following properties:

[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT test
{
    "settings" : {
        "number_of_shards" : 1
    },
    "mappings" : {
        "properties" : {
            "rule_id" : { "type" : "text" },
            "rule_name" : { "type" : "text" },
            "alert_id" : { "type" : "text" },
            "context_message": { "type" : "text" }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Your test document could contain the following properties and variables:

[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "rule_id": "{{rule.id}}",
    "rule_name": "{{rule.name}}",
    "alert_id": "{{alert.id}}",
    "context_message": "{{context.message}}"
}
--------------------------------------------------
