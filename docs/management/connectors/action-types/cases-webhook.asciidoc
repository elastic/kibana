== Webhook - Case Management connector and action
++++
<titleabbrev>Webhook - Case Management</titleabbrev>
++++

The Webhook - Case Management connector uses https://github.com/axios/axios[axios] to send POST, PUT, and GET requests to a Case Management RESTful API web service. The resulting connector can be used with Kibana Cases to create and update a case in the third party web service.

[[cases-webhook-connector-configuration]]
=== Connector configuration

Webhook - Case Management connectors have the following configuration properties.

Name::      The name of the connector. The name is used to identify a  connector in the management UI connector listing, or in the connector list when configuring an action.
Require authentication:: If true, a username and password for login type authentication must be provided.
Username::      Username for HTTP basic authentication.
Password::  Password for HTTP basic authentication.
Headers::   A set of key-value pairs sent as headers with the request URLs for the create case, update case, get case, and create comment methods.
Create Case Method::  REST API HTTP request method to create case in third party system, either `post`(default), `put`, or `patch`.
Create Case URL::       Rest API URL to create case in third party system. If you are using the <<action-settings, `xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure the hostname is added to the allowed hosts.
Create Case Object::      A JSON payload sent to the create case URL to create case. Use the variable selector to add Kibana Cases data to the payload. Required variables are `case.title` and `case.description`. For example:
+
[source,json]
--
{
	"fields": {
	  "summary": {{{case.title}}},
	  "description": {{{case.description}}},
	  "labels": {{{case.tags}}}
	}
}
--
Note: Due to Mustache template variables (the text enclosed in triple braces, for example, `{{{case.title}}}`), the JSON is not validated in this step. The JSON is validated once the mustache variables have been placed when REST method is executed. Manually ensure that the JSON is valid, disregarding the mustache variables, so the later validation will pass.

Create Case Response - Case ID Key::   JSON key in create case response that contains the external case id
Get Case URL::       Rest API URL to GET case by id from third party system. Use the variable selector to add external system id to the url. If you are using the <<action-settings, `xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure the hostname is added to the allowed hosts. For example:
+
[source,text]
--
https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/{{{external.system.id}}}
--
Note: Due to Mustache template variables (the text enclosed in triple braces, for example, `{{{case.title}}}`), the JSON is not validated in this step. The JSON is validated once the mustache variables have been placed when REST method is executed. Manually ensure that the JSON is valid, disregarding the mustache variables, so the later validation will pass.

Get Case Response - Title Key::   JSON key in get case response that contains the external case title
Get Case Response - Created Date Key::   JSON key in get case response that contains the external case created date
Get Case Response - Updated Date Key::   JSON key in get case response that contains the external case updated date
External Case View URL::       URL to view case in external system. Use the variable selector to add external system id or external system title to the url. For example:
+
[source,text]
--
https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/browse/{{{external.system.title}}}
--
Update Case Method::  REST API HTTP request method to update case in third party system, either `post`, `put`(default), or `patch`.
Update Case URL::       Rest API URL to update case by id in third party system. Use the variable selector to add external system id to the url. If you are using the <<action-settings, `xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure the hostname is added to the allowed hosts. For example:
+
[source,text]
--
https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/{{{external.system.id}}}
--
Update Case Object::      A JSON payload sent to the update case URL to update case. Use the variable selector to add Kibana Cases data to the payload. Required variables are `case.title` and `case.description`. For example:
+
[source,json]
--
{
	"fields": {
	  "summary": {{{case.title}}},
	  "description": {{{case.description}}},
	  "labels": {{{case.tags}}}
	}
}
--
Note: Due to Mustache template variables (the text enclosed in triple braces, for example, `{{{case.title}}}`), the JSON is not validated in this step. The JSON is validated once the mustache variables have been placed when REST method is executed. Manually ensure that the JSON is valid, disregarding the mustache variables, so the later validation will pass.
Create Comment Method::  (optional) REST API HTTP request method to create a case comment in third party system, either `post`, `put`(default), or `patch`.
Create Comment URL::       (optional) Rest API URL to create a case comment by id in third party system. Use the variable selector to add external system id to the url. If you are using the <<action-settings, `xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure the hostname is added to the allowed hosts. For example:
+
[source,text]
--
https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/{{{external.system.id}}}/comment
--
Create Comment Object::      (optional) A JSON payload sent to the create comment URL to create a case comment. Use the variable selector to add Kibana Cases data to the payload. The required variable is `case.comment`. For example:
+
[source,json]
--
{
  "body": {{{case.comment}}}
}
--
Note: Due to Mustache template variables (the text enclosed in triple braces, for example, `{{{case.title}}}`), the JSON is not validated in this step. The JSON is validated once the mustache variables have been placed when REST method is executed. Manually ensure that the JSON is valid, disregarding the mustache variables, so the later validation will pass.

[[cases-webhook-connector-full-example]]
== Webhook - Case Management Connector - Full Example

The following is an example of using the Webhook - Case Management Connector with a real third party case management system, Jira. We will reference their https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-issues/[API documentation] for creating an issue and use a demo instance of Jira with real working endpoints.

_Note: We are using Jira as an example third party. However, if you wish to connect with Jira, using the <<jira-action-type, preconfigured Jira connector>> will simplify your setup._

[float]
===  Step 1 - Set up connector

In the Webhook - Case Management connector create flyout, we begin by entering a *Name* for the connector - `Jira Test Connector`. We are going to use basic authentication in this example, so we keep the *Require authentication* checkbox checked and enter the *Username* and *Password* for the test instance, `test-user@elastic.co` and `notarealpassword`. We will not be setting any *Headers* for the requests.

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/cases-webhook-step1.png[Webhook - Case Management connector Step 1, Jira example]

[float]
===  Step 2 - Create case

Taking a look at the Jira https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-2-issue-post[Create issue method documentation], we can find what values we will need to fill step 2.

Jira create issue request method: `POST`

Jira create issue request url: `/rest/api/2/issue`

Jira create issue request body:
[source,json]
--
{
    "fields": {
        "summary": "Main order flow broken",
        "description": "Order entry fails when selecting supplier.",
        "labels": ["bugfix",  "blitz_test"],
        "project":{"key":"PROJ-123"},
        "issuetype":{"id":"10000"}
    }
}
--

Jira create issue response body:
[source,json]
--
{
  "id": "10000",
  "key": "ED-24",
  "self": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/10000",
  "transition": {
    "status": 200,
    "errorCollection": {
      "errorMessages": [],
      "errors": {}
    }
  }
}
--
In the screen capture below, on Step 2 we enter `POST` as the *Create Case Method* and `https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue` as the **Create Case Url**. In our example Jira instance, the project key is "ROC" and the issuetype id is "10024". We have entered the Jira request JSON as the *Create Case Object*, updating the project key to "ROC" and the issuetype id to "10024". We then use the Case variable selector to enter where we will map the Kibana case title, Kibana case description, and Kibana case tags. The Jira response body contains an id with the JSON key of "id", so we enter `id` as the *Create Case Response - Case ID Key*.

[float]
===  Step 3 - Get case information

Next we'll need to look at Jira's https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-2-issue-issueidorkey-[Get issue method documentation] to find the values for step 3. In the GET response JSON below, we thinned out some null/unrelated data so that we can focus on the fields we need.

Jira get issue request url: `/rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}`

Jira get issue response body:
[source,json]
--
{
    "id": "71964",
    "self": "https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/71964",
    "key": "ROC-584",
    "fields": {
        "issuetype": {
            "self": "https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issuetype/10024",
            "id": "10024",
            "description": "An improvement or enhancement to an existing feature or task.",
            "name": "Improvement",
            "subtask": false,
            "avatarId": 10310,
            "hierarchyLevel": 0
        },
        "project": {
            "self": "https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/project/10021",
            "id": "10021",
            "key": "ROC",
            "name": "ResponseOps Cases",
            "projectTypeKey": "software",
            "simplified": false
        },
        "created": "2022-08-02T16:52:20.554+0300",
        "priority": {
            "name": "Medium",
            "id": "3"
        },
        "labels": ["kibanaTag"],
        "updated": "2022-08-02T16:52:20.554+0300",
        "status": {
            "self": "https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/10003",
            "description": "",
            "name": "To Do",
            "id": "10003",
            "statusCategory": {
                "self": "https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/statuscategory/2",
                "id": 2,
                "key": "new",
                "colorName": "blue-gray",
                "name": "To Do"
            }
        },
        "description": "Kibana Description",
        "summary": "Kibana Title",
        "creator": {
            "self": "https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?accountId=12345",
            "accountId": "12345",
            "emailAddress": "test-user@elastic.co",
            "displayName": "MLR-QA",
            "active": true,
            "timeZone": "Europe/Athens",
            "accountType": "atlassian"
        },
        "reporter": {
            "self": "https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?accountId=12345",
            "accountId": "12345",
            "emailAddress": "test-user@elastic.co",
            "displayName": "MLR-QA",
            "active": true,
            "timeZone": "Europe/Athens",
            "accountType": "atlassian"
        },
        "comment": {
            "comments": [],
            "self": "https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/71964/comment",
            "maxResults": 0,
            "total": 0,
            "startAt": 0
        }
    }
}
--

To make the Get Case URL, we see we need `/rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}`. We will fill in the value with the issue id, which we stored in the last step as *Create Case Response - Case ID Key*. Using the variable selector on the Get Case URL input, we can see the issue id is stored as a mustache value `{{{external.system.id}}}`. So our value for *Get Case URL* will be `https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/{{{external.system.id}}}`.

In the response JSON we can see the title of the case is "ROC-538". The key for this value is `key` so we enter `key` as the *Get Case Response External Title Key* value. The *Get Case Response Created Date Key* is `fields.created` and the *Get Case Response Updated Date Key* is `fields.updated`. 

We also need the *External Case View URL*. https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/link-an-issue/[Jira's documentation] instructs you to get the link from the issue itself. The format for this link looks like `https://<user’s subdomain>.atlassian.net/browse/<issueKey>`. We mapped `key` to the *Get Case Response External Title Key* and using the variable selector on the *External Case View URL* input, we can see the issue key is stored as a mustache value `{{{external.system.title}}}`. Using this, the value for *External Case View URL* is `https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/browse/{{{external.system.title}}}`.

image::management/connectors/images/cases-webhook-step3.gif[Webhook - Case Management connector Step 3, Jira example]

[float]
===  Step 4 - Comments and updates

In Step 4 we need to set the REST API data for updates and comments. Let's look at Jira's https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-2-issue-issueidorkey-put[Edit issue documentation].

Jira update issue request method: `PUT`

Jira update issue request url: `/rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}`

Jira update issue request body:
[source,json]
--
{
    "fields": {
        "summary": "Main order flow broken",
        "description": "Order entry fails when selecting supplier.",
        "labels": ["bugfix",  "blitz_test"],
        "project":{"key":"PROJ-123"},
        "issuetype":{"id":"10000"}
    }
}
--

In the screen capture below, on Step 4 we enter `PUT` as the *Update Case Method* and `https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/{{{external.system.id}}}` as the **Update Case Url** using the variable selector to insert the `{{{external.system.id}}}`. Just like the create case JSON, have entered the Jira request JSON as the *Update Case Object*, updating the project key to "ROC" and the issuetype id to "10024". We then use the Case variable selector to enter where we will map the Kibana case title, Kibana case description, and Kibana case tags.
[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/cases-webhook-step4a.gif[Webhook - Case Management connector Step 4 Update, Jira example]

Lastly we will look at Jira's https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-issue-comments/#api-rest-api-2-issue-issueidorkey-comment-post[Add comment documentation] to fill out the optional comment REST fields.

Jira create comment request method: `POST`

Jira create comment request url: `/rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/comment`

Jira create comment request body:
[source,json]
--
{
    "body": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet."
}
--

In the screen capture below, on Step 4 we enter `POST` as the *Create Comment Method* and `https://testing-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/{{{external.system.id}}}/comment` as the **Create Comment Url** using the variable selector to insert the `{{{external.system.id}}}`. We enter the Jira request JSON as the *Create Comment Object*, using the Case variable selector to enter where we will map the Kibana case comment.
