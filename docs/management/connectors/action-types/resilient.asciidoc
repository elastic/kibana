The IBM Resilient connector uses the https://developer.ibm.com/security/resilient/rest/[RESILIENT REST v2] to create IBM Resilient incidents.

[[define-resilient-ui]]
=== Create connectors in {kib}

You can create connectors in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*
or as needed when you're creating a rule. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/resilient-connector.png[IBM Resilient connector]

[[resilient-connector-configuration]]
==== Connector configuration

IBM Resilient connectors have the following configuration properties:

Name::      The name of the connector.
URL::       IBM Resilient instance URL.
Organization ID:: IBM Resilient organization ID.
API key ID::  The authentication key ID for HTTP Basic authentication.
API key secret::  The authentication key secret for HTTP Basic authentication.

[[preconfigured-resilient-configuration]]
=== Create preconfigured connectors

If you are running {kib} on-prem, you can define connectors by
adding `xpack.actions.preconfigured` settings to your `kibana.yml` file.
For example:

[source,text]
--
xpack.actions.preconfigured:
  my-resilient:
    name: preconfigured-resilient-connector-type
    actionTypeId: .resilient
    config:
      apiUrl: https://elastic.resilient.net
      orgId: ES
    secrets:
      apiKeyId: testuser
      apiKeySecret: tokenkeystorevalue
--

Config defines information for the connector type.

`apiUrl`:: An address that corresponds to *URL*.
`orgId`:: An ID that corresponds to *Organization ID*.

Secrets defines sensitive information for the connector type.

`apiKeyId`:: A string that corresponds to *API key ID*.
`apiKeySecret`:: A string that corresponds to *API Key secret*. Should be stored in the <<creating-keystore, {kib} keystore>>.

[[resilient-action-configuration]]
=== Test connectors

You can test connectors with the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or
as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/resilient-params-test.png[IBM Resilient params test]


IBM Resilient actions have the following configuration properties.

Incident types:: The type of the incident.
Severity code:: The severity of the incident.
Name:: A name for the issue, used for searching the contents of the knowledge base.
Description:: The details about the incident.
Additional comments:: Additional information for the client, such as how to troubleshoot the issue.

[float]
[[resilient-connector-networking-configuration]]
=== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.

[[configuring-resilient]]
=== Configure IBM Resilient

IBM Resilient offers https://www.ibm.com/security/intelligent-orchestration/resilient[Instances], which you can use to test incidents.
