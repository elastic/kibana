:frontmatter-description: Add a connector that can send requests to a web service.
:frontmatter-tags-products: [alerting]

The Webhook connector uses https://github.com/axios/axios[axios] to send a POST or PUT request to a web service.

=== Create connectors in {kib}

You can create connectors in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*
or as needed when you're creating a rule. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/webhook-connector.png[Webhook connector]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

[[webhook-connector-configuration]]
==== Connector configuration

Webhook connectors have the following configuration properties:

Name::      The name of the connector.
Method::    The HTTP request method, either `post`(default) or `put`.
URL::       The request URL. If you are using the <<action-settings,`xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure the hostname is added to the allowed hosts.
Authentication::
The authentication type: none, basic, or SSL.
If you choose basic authentication, you must provide a user name and password.
If you choose SSL authentication, you must provide SSL server certificate authentication data in a CRT and key file format or a PFX file format. You can also optionally provide a passphrase if the files are password-protected.
HTTP headers::
A set of key-value pairs sent as headers with the request.
For example, set `Content-Type` to the appropriate media type for your requests.
Certificate authority::
A certificate authority (CA) that the connector can trust, for example to sign and validate server certificates.
This option is available for all authentication types.
CA file:::
The certificate authority file.
Verification mode:::
Controls the certificate verification.
+
--
* Use `full` to validate that the certificate has an issue date within the `not_before` and `not_after` dates, chains to a trusted certificate authority, and has a hostname or IP address that matches the names within the certificate.
* Use `certificate` to validate the certificate and verifies that it is signed by a trusted authority; this option does not check the certificate hostname.
* Use `none` to skip certificate validation.

=== Test connectors

You can test connectors with the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or
as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/webhook-params-test.png[Webhook params test]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

Webhook actions have the following properties.

Body::      A JSON payload sent to the request URL. For example: 
+
[source,text]
--
{
  "short_description": "{{context.rule.name}}",
  "description": "{{context.rule.description}}",
  ...
}
--

Mustache template variables (the text enclosed in double braces, for example, `context.rule.name`) have
their values escaped, so that the final JSON will be valid (escaping double quote characters).
For more information on Mustache template variables, refer to <<defining-rules-actions-details>>.

[[webhook-connector-networking-configuration]]
=== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.
