Name::      The name of the connector. The name is used to identify a  connector in the management UI connector listing, or in the connector list when configuring an action.
URL::       The request URL. If you are using the <<action-settings, `xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure the hostname is added to the allowed hosts.
Method::    HTTP request method, either `post`(default) or `put`.
Headers::   A set of key-value pairs sent as headers with the request
Require authentication:: If true, a username and password for login type authentication must be provided.
Username::      Username for HTTP basic authentication.

[[webhook-connector-networking-configuration]]
==== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.

==== Preconfigured connector type

[source,text]
--
 my-webhook:
   name: preconfigured-webhook-connector-type
   actionTypeId: .webhook
   config:
     url: https://test.host
     method: post
     headers:
       testheader: testvalue
   secrets:
     user: testuser
     password: passwordkeystorevalue
--

Config defines information for the connector type.

`url`:: A URL string that corresponds to *URL*.
`method`:: A string that corresponds to *Method*.
`headers`:: A record<string, string> that corresponds to *Headers*.
`hasAuth`:: A boolean that corresponds to *Requires authentication*. If `true`, this connector will require values for `user` and `password` inside the secrets configuration. Defaults to `true`.

Secrets defines sensitive information for the connector type.

`user`:: A string that corresponds to *User*. Required if `hasAuth` is set to `true`.
`password`:: A string that corresponds to *Password*. Should be stored in the <<creating-keystore, {kib} keystore>>. Required if `hasAuth` is set to `true`.

[[webhook-action-configuration]]
==== Action configuration

Webhook actions have the following properties.

Body::      A JSON payload sent to the request URL. For example: 
+
[source,text]
--
{
  "short_description": "{{context.rule.name}}",
  "description": "{{context.rule.description}}",
  ...
}
--

Mustache template variables (the text enclosed in double braces, for example, `context.rule.name`) have
their values escaped, so that the final JSON will be valid (escaping double quote characters).
For more information on Mustache template variables, refer to <<defining-rules-actions-details>>.
