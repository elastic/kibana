==== Prerequisites
To use the Elastic xMatters connector either install the Elastic workflow template, or add the Elastic Alerts trigger to one of your existing xMatters flows. Once the workflow or trigger is in your xMatters instance, configure Elastic to send alerts to xMatters.

. In xMatters, double-click the Elastic trigger to open the settings menu.
. Choose the authentication method and set your authenticating user.
. Copy the initiation URL.
. In Elastic, open the xMatters connector.
. Set the authentication method, then paste the initiation URL.

Note: If you use basic authentication, specify the Web / App Login ID in the user credentials for the connector. This value can be found in the Edit Profile modal in xMatters for each user.
