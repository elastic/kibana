==== Connector configuration

xMatters connectors have the following configuration properties.

Name::                                 The name of the connector. The name is used to identify a connector in the management UI connector listing, or in the connector list when configuring an action.
URL:: The request URL for the Elastic Alerts trigger in xMatters. If you are using the <<action-settings, `xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure the hostname is added to the allowed hosts.
Require authentication::                                                                                               If true, a username and password for login type authentication must be provided.
Username::                                                                                                                                                      Username for HTTP Basic Authentication.
Password::                                                                                                                                                      Password for HTTP Basic Authentication.

[[xmatters-connector-networking-configuration]]
==== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.

==== Preconfigured connector type

[source,text]
--
 my-xmatters:
   name: preconfigured-xmatters-connector-type
   actionTypeId: .xmatters
   config:
     url: https://test.host
   secrets:
     user: testuser
     password: passwordkeystorevalue
--

Config defines information for the connector type.

`url`:: A URL string that corresponds to *URL*.
`hasAuth`:: A boolean that corresponds to *Requires authentication*. If `true`, this connector will require values for `user` and `password` inside the secrets configuration. Defaults to `true`.

Secrets defines sensitive information for the connector type.

`user`:: A string that corresponds to *User*. Required if `hasAuth` is set to `true`.
`password`:: A string that corresponds to *Password*. Should be stored in the <<creating-keystore, {kib} keystore>>. Required if `hasAuth` is set to `true`.

==== Action configuration

xMatters rules have the following properties.

ruleName:                                                 Name of the Elastic rule. 
date:                                           Date the rule scheduled the action.
severity:                                                     Severity of the rule.
spaceId:                                    Unique ID of the rule space in Elastic.
tags: Comma-separated list of tags for the rule as provided by the user in Elastic.

Here is an example set of inputs:
--
{
  "ruleName": "{{ruleName}}",
  "date": "{{date}}",
  "severity": "High",
  ...
}
--

Mustache template variables (the text enclosed in double braces, for example, `context.rule.name`) have
their values escaped, so that the final JSON will be valid (escaping double quote characters).
For more information on Mustache template variables, refer to <<defining-rules-actions-details>>.
