=== ServiceNow SecOps connector and action
++++
<titleabbrev>ServiceNow SecOps</titleabbrev>
++++

The ServiceNow SecOps connector uses the https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-application-development/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_TableAPI.html[V2 Table API] to create ServiceNow security incidents.

[[servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites
After upgrading to 7.16, you must complete the following within your ServiceNow instance before creating a new ServiceNow SecOps connector or <<servicenow-sir-connector-update, updating an existing one>>:

* Install [Elastic for Security Operations (SecOps)] https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/2f0746801baeb01019ae54e4604bcb0f from the ServiceNow Store.
* Create a ServiceNow integration user and assign it the appropriate roles.
* Create a CORS rule.

*Create a ServiceNow integration user*

To ensure authenticated communication between Elastic and ServiceNow, create a ServiceNow integration user and assign it the appropriate roles. 

. Go to *System Security -> Users*.
. Click *New*.
. Complete the form.
. Assign the integration user the following roles: 
* `import_set_loader`
* `import_transformer`
* `personalize_choices`
* `sn_si.basic`
* `x_elas2_sir_int.integration_user`
. Click *Submit* to create the user.

*Create a CORS rule*

A CORS rule is required for communication between the Elastic and ServiceNow. To create a CORS rule:

. Go to *System Web Services -> CORS Rules*.
. Click *New*.
. Configure the rule settings to use the Elastic SIR API and the Kibana URL:
* *REST API*: Choose `Elastic SIR API [x_elas2_sir_int/elastic_api]`.
* *Domain*: Enter the Kibana URL.
. Go to the *HTTP methods* tab and select *GET*. This chooses the GET HTTP method.
. Click *Submit* to create the rule.

[[servicenow-sir-connector-update]]
==== Update a deprecated ServiceNow SecOps connector

ServiceNow SecOps connectors created in 7.15 version are marked as deprecated after you upgrade to 7.16. Deprecated connectors have a yellow icon after their name and display a warning message when you select them.

image::management/connectors/images/servicenow-sir-update-connector.png[Shows deprecated ServiceNow connectors]

IMPORTANT: Deprecated connectors will continue to function with the rules they were added to and can be assigned to a new rule. However, we strongly recommend updating the deprecated connector or <<creating-new-connector, creating a new one>> to ensure you have access to connector enhancements, such as updating incidents.

To update a deprecated connector:

. Open the main menu and go to *Stack Management -> Rules and connectors -> Connectors*.
. Select the deprecated connector to open the connector Edit flyout.
. In the warning message, click *Update this connector*.
. Complete the guided steps in the Edit connector flyout.
.. Install Elastic for Security Operations (SecOps) from the https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home[ServiceNow Store] and complete the <<servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites, required prerequisites>>.
.. Enter the URL of your ServiceNow instance.
.. Enter the username and password of your ServiceNow instance.
. Click *Update*.

[[servicenow-sir-connector-configuration]]
==== Connector configuration

ServiceNow SecOps connectors have the following configuration properties.

Name::      The name of the connector. The name is used to identify a  connector in the **Stack Management** UI connector listing, and in the connector list when configuring an action.
URL::       ServiceNow instance URL.
Username::  Username for HTTP Basic authentication.
Password::  Password for HTTP Basic authentication.

[[servicenow-sir-connector-networking-configuration]]
==== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.

[[Preconfigured-servicenow-sir-configuration]]
==== Preconfigured connector type

[source,text]
--
 my-servicenow-sir:
   name: preconfigured-servicenow-connector-type
   actionTypeId: .servicenow-sir
   config:
     apiUrl: https://example.service-now.com/
     usesTableApi: false
   secrets:
     username: testuser
     password: passwordkeystorevalue
--

Config defines information for the connector type.

`apiUrl`:: An address that corresponds to *URL*.
`usesTableApi`:: A boolean that indicates if the connector uses the Table API or the Import Set API.

Note: If `usesTableApi` is set to false the Elastic application should be installed in ServiceNow.

Secrets defines sensitive information for the connector type.

`username`:: A string that corresponds to *Username*.
`password`::  A string that corresponds to *Password*. Should be stored in the <<creating-keystore, {kib} keystore>>.

[[servicenow-sir-action-configuration]]
==== Action configuration

ServiceNow SecOps actions have the following configuration properties.

Short description::    A short description for the incident, used for searching the contents of the knowledge base.
Priority::             The priority of the incident.
Category::             The category of the incident.
Subcategory::          The subcategory of the incident.
Correlation ID::       Connectors using the same Correlation ID will be associated with the same ServiceNow incident. This value determines whether a new ServiceNow incident will be created or an existing one is updated. Modifying this value is optional; if not modified, the rule ID and alert ID are combined as `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` to form the Correlation ID value in ServiceNow. The maximum character length for this value is 100 characters.

NOTE: Using the default configuration of `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` ensures that ServiceNow will create a separate incident record for every generated alert that uses a unique alert ID. In other words, if the rule generates multiple alerts that use the same alert IDs, ServiceNow creates and continually updates a single incident record for the alert.

Correlation Display::  A descriptive label of the alert for correlation purposes in ServiceNow.
Description::          The details about the incident.
Additional comments::  Additional information for the client, such as how to troubleshoot the issue.
