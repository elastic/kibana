:frontmatter-description: Add a connector that can create {sn} security incidents.
:frontmatter-tags-products: [kibana] 
:frontmatter-tags-content-type: [how-to] 
:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [configure]

The {sn-sir} connector uses the
https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/sandiego/rest/c_ImportSetAPI[import set API]
to create {sn} security incidents. You can use the connector for rule actions and cases.

[[define-servicenow-sir-ui]]
=== Create connectors in {kib}

You can create connectors in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*
or as needed when you're creating a rule. You must choose whether to use OAuth for authentication.

[[servicenow-sir-connector-configuration]]
==== Connector configuration

{sn-sir} connectors have the following configuration properties:

Client ID::
The client ID assigned to your OAuth application.
Client Secret::
The client secret assigned to your OAuth application.
JWT verifier key ID::
The key identifier assigned to the JWT verifier map of your OAuth application.
Password::
The password for HTTP basic authentication.
Private key::
The RSA private key that you created for use in {sn}.
Private key password::
The password for the RSA private key.
This value is required if you set a password for your private key.
{sn} instance URL::
The full {sn} instance URL.
Use OAuth authentication::
By default, basic authentication is used instead of open authorization (OAuth).
User identifier::
The identifier to use for OAuth type authentication.
This identifier should be the user field you selected during setup.
For example, if the selected user field is `Email`, the user identifier should be the user's email address.
Username::
The username for HTTP basic authentication.

[[servicenow-sir-action-configuration]]
=== Test connectors

You can test connectors as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/servicenow-sir-params-test.png[{sn-sir} params test]

{sn-sir} actions have the following configuration properties.

Additional comments::
Additional information for the client, such as how to troubleshoot the issue.
Category::
The category of the incident.
Correlation display::
A descriptive label of the alert for correlation purposes in {sn}.
Correlation ID::
Connectors using the same correlation ID will be associated with the same {sn} incident.
This value determines whether a new {sn} incident will be created or an existing one is updated. Modifying this value is optional; if not modified, the rule ID and alert ID are combined as `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` to form the correlation ID value in {sn}.
The maximum character length for this value is 100 characters.
+
--
NOTE: Using the default configuration of `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` ensures that {sn} will create a separate incident record for every generated alert that uses a unique alert ID.
If the rule generates multiple alerts that use the same alert IDs, {sn} creates and continually updates a single incident record for the alert.
--

Description::
The details about the incident.
Priority::
The priority of the incident.
Short description::
A short description for the incident, used for searching the contents of the knowledge base.
Subcategory::
The subcategory of the incident.

[[servicenow-sir-connector-networking-configuration]]
=== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.

[[configuring-servicenow-sir]]
=== Configure {sn-sir}

{sn} offers free https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/guides/madrid/now-platform/pdi-guide/obtaining-a-pdi[Personal Developer Instances], which you can use to test incidents.

[[servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites
After upgrading from {stack} version 7.15.0 or earlier to version 7.16.0 or later, you must complete the following within your {sn} instance before creating a new {sn-sir} connector or <<servicenow-sir-connector-update, updating an existing one>>:

. Install https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/2f0746801baeb01019ae54e4604bcb0f[Elastic for Security Operations (SecOps)] from the {sn} Store.
. <<servicenow-sir-connector-privileges,Assign cross-scope privileges for the Elastic for Security Operations app>>.
. <<servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-integration-user,Create a {sn} integration user and assign it the appropriate roles>>.
. <<servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-cors-rule,Create a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rule>>.
. If you use open authorization (OAuth), you must also:
.. <<servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-rsa-key,Create an RSA keypair and add an X.509 Certificate>>.
.. <<servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-endpoint,Create an OAuth JWT API endpoint for external clients with a JWT Verifiers Map>>.

[[servicenow-sir-connector-privileges]]
==== Assign cross-scope privileges

The Elastic for Security Operations app requires specific cross-scope privilege records to run successfully.
In particular, you must have a privilege record for the `Elastic for Security Operations` application with the status set to `Allowed` for each of the following targets:

|===
|Target scope|Name|Type|Operation

|Global
|Glide API: string utilities
|Scriptable
|Execute API

To access the cross scope privileges table:

1. Log into {sn} and set your application scope to Elastic for Security Operations.
2. Click *All* and search for `sys_scope_privilege`.

For more details, refer to the https://docs.servicenow.com/[{sn} product documentation].


[float]
[[servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-integration-user]]
==== Create a {sn} integration user

To ensure authenticated communication between Elastic and {sn}, create a {sn} integration user and assign it the appropriate roles. 

. In your {sn} instance, go to *System Security -> Users and Groups -> Users*.
. Click *New*.
. Complete the form, then right-click on the menu bar and click *Save*.
. Go to the *Roles* tab and click *Edit*.
. Assign the integration user the following roles: 
* `import_set_loader`
* `import_transformer`
* `personalize_choices`
* `sn_si.basic`
* `x_elas2_sir_int.integration_user`
. Click *Save*.

[float]
[[servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-cors-rule]]
==== Create a CORS rule

A CORS rule is required for communication between Elastic and {sn}. To create a CORS rule:

. In your {sn} instance, go to *System Web Services -> REST -> CORS Rules*.
. Click *New*.
. Configure the rule as follows:
* *Name*: Name the rule.
* *REST API*: Set the rule to use the Elastic SecOps API by choosing `Elastic SIR API [x_elas2_sir_int/elastic_api]`.
* *Domain*: Enter the Kibana URL, including the port number.
. Go to the *HTTP methods* tab and select *GET*.
. Click *Submit* to create the rule.

[[servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-rsa-key]]
==== Create an RSA keypair and add an X.509 Certificate

This step is required to use OAuth for authentication between Elastic and {sn}.

[[servicenow-sir-connector-update]]
=== Update a deprecated {sn-sir} connector

{sn-sir} connectors created in {stack} version 7.15.0 or earlier are marked as deprecated after you upgrade to version 7.16.0 or later. Deprecated connectors have a yellow icon after their name and display a warning message when selected.

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/servicenow-sir-update-connector.png[Shows deprecated ServiceNow connectors]

IMPORTANT: Deprecated connectors will continue to function with the rules they were added to and can be assigned to new rules. However, it is strongly recommended to update deprecated connectors or <<creating-new-connector, create new ones>> to ensure you have access to connector enhancements, such as updating incidents.

To update a deprecated connector:

. Open the main menu and go to *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*.
. Select the deprecated connector to open the *Edit connector* flyout.
. In the warning message, click *Update this connector*.
. Complete the guided steps in the *Edit connector* flyout.
.. Install https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/2f0746801baeb01019ae54e4604bcb0f[Elastic for Security Operations (SecOps)] from the {sn} Store and complete the <<servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites, required prerequisites>>.
.. Enter the URL of your {sn} instance.
.. Enter the username and password of your {sn} instance.
. Click *Update*.
