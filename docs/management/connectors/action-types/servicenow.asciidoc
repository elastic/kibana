=== ServiceNow ITSM connector and action
++++
<titleabbrev>ServiceNow ITSM</titleabbrev>
++++

The {sn} ITSM connector uses the https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-application-development/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_TableAPI.html[V2 Table API] to create {sn} incidents.

[[servicenow-itsm-connector-prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites
After upgrading from {stack} version 7.15.0 or earlier to version 7.16.0 or later, you must complete the following within your {sn} instance before creating a new {sn} ITSM connector or <<servicenow-itsm-connector-update, updating an existing one>>:

* Install https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/7148dbc91bf1f450ced060a7234bcb88[Elastic for ITSM] from the {sn} Store.
* Create a {sn} integration user and assign it the appropriate roles.
* Create a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rule.

*Create a {sn} integration user*

To ensure authenticated communication between Elastic and {sn}, create a {sn} integration user and assign it the appropriate roles.

. In your {sn} instance, go to *System Security -> Users and Groups -> Users*.
. Click *New*.
. Complete the form, then right-click on the menu bar and click *Save*.
. Go to the *Roles* tab and click *Edit*.
. Assign the integration user the following roles:Â 
* `import_set_loader`
* `import_transformer`
* `personalize_choices`
* `x_elas2_inc_int.integration_user`
. Click *Save*.

*Create a CORS rule*

A CORS rule is required for communication between Elastic and {sn}. To create a CORS rule:

. In your {sn} instance, go to *System Web Services -> REST -> CORS Rules*.
. Click *New*.
. Configure the rule as follows:
* *Name*: Name the rule.
* *REST API*: Set the rule to use the Elastic ITSM API by choosing `Elastic ITSM API [x_elas2_inc_int/elastic_api]`.
* *Domain*: Enter the Kibana URL.
. Go to the *HTTP methods* tab and select *GET*.
. Click *Submit* to create the rule.

==== Update a deprecated {sn} ITSM connector

{sn} ITSM connectors created in {stack} version 7.15.0 or earlier are marked as deprecated after you upgrade to version 7.16.0 or later. Deprecated connectors have a yellow icon after their name and display a warning message when selected.

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/servicenow-sir-update-connector.png[Shows deprecated ServiceNow connectors]

IMPORTANT: Deprecated connectors will continue to function with the rules they were added to and can be assigned to new rules. However, it is strongly recommended to update deprecated connectors or <<creating-new-connector, create new ones>> to ensure you have access to connector enhancements, such as updating incidents.

To update a deprecated connector:

. Open the main menu and go to *Stack Management -> Rules and connectors -> Connectors*.
. Select the deprecated connector to open the *Edit connector* flyout.
. In the warning message, click *Update this connector*.
. Complete the guided steps in the *Edit connector* flyout.
.. Install https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/7148dbc91bf1f450ced060a7234bcb88[Elastic for ITSM] and complete the <<servicenow-itsm-connector-prerequisites, required prerequisites>>.
.. Enter the URL of your {sn} instance.
.. Enter the username and password of your {sn} instance.
. Click *Update*.

[[servicenow-connector-configuration]]
==== Connector configuration

{sn} ITSM connectors have the following configuration properties.

Name::      The name of the connector. The name is used to identify a  connector in the **Stack Management** UI connector listing, and in the connector list when configuring an action.
URL::       {sn} instance URL.
Username::  Username for HTTP Basic authentication.
Password::  Password for HTTP Basic authentication.

[float]
[[servicenow-connector-networking-configuration]]
==== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.

[[Preconfigured-servicenow-configuration]]
==== Preconfigured connector type

[source,text]
--
 my-servicenow:
   name: preconfigured-servicenow-connector-type
   actionTypeId: .servicenow
   config:
     apiUrl: https://example.service-now.com/
     usesTableApi: false
   secrets:
     username: testuser
     password: passwordkeystorevalue
--

Config defines information for the connector type.

`apiUrl`:: An address that corresponds to *URL*.
`usesTableApi`:: A boolean that indicates if the connector uses the Table API or the Import Set API.

NOTE: If `usesTableApi` is set to false, the Elastic application should be installed in {sn}.

Secrets defines sensitive information for the connector type.

`username`:: A string that corresponds to *Username*.
`password`::  A string that corresponds to *Password*. Should be stored in the <<creating-keystore, {kib} keystore>>.

[[servicenow-action-configuration]]
==== Action configuration

{sn} ITSM actions have the following configuration properties.

Urgency::              The extent to which the incident resolution can delay.
Severity::             The severity of the incident.
Impact::               The effect an incident has on business. Can be measured by the number of affected users or by how critical it is to the business in question.
Category::             The category of the incident.
Subcategory::          The category of the incident.
Correlation ID::            Connectors using the same Correlation ID will be associated with the same {sn} incident. This value determines whether a new {sn} incident will be created or an existing one is updated. Modifying this value is optional; if not modified, the rule ID and alert ID are combined as `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` to form the Correlation ID value in {sn}. The maximum character length for this value is 100 characters.

NOTE: Using the default configuration of `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` ensures that {sn} will create a separate incident record for every generated alert that uses a unique alert ID. If the rule generates multiple alerts that use the same alert IDs, {sn} creates and continually updates a single incident record for the alert.

Correlation Display::  A descriptive label of the alert for correlation purposes in {sn}.
Short description::    A short description for the incident, used for searching the contents of the knowledge base.
Description::          The details about the incident.
Additional comments::  Additional information for the client, such as how to troubleshoot the issue.
