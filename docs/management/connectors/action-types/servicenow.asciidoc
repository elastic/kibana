[[servicenow-itsm-connector-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

After upgrading from {stack} version 7.15.0 or earlier to version 7.16.0 or
later, you must complete the following steps within your {sn} instance before
creating a new {sn-itsm} connector or
<<servicenow-itsm-connector-update,updating an existing one>>:

. Install
https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/7148dbc91bf1f450ced060a7234bcb88[Elastic for ITSM]
from the {sn} Store.
. <<servicenow-itsm-connector-prerequisites-integration-user,Create a {sn} integration user and assign it the appropriate roles>>.
. <<servicenow-itsm-connector-prerequisites-cors-rule,Create a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rule>>.
. If you use open authorization (OAuth), you must also:
.. <<servicenow-itsm-connector-prerequisites-rsa-key,Create an RSA keypair and add an X.509 Certificate>>.
.. <<servicenow-itsm-connector-prerequisites-endpoint,Create an OAuth JWT API endpoint for external clients with a JWT Verifiers Map>>.

[[servicenow-itsm-connector-prerequisites-rsa-key]]
==== Create an RSA keypair and add an X.509 certificate

This step is required to use OAuth for authentication between Elastic and {sn}.

// tag::servicenow-rsa-key[]
*Create an RSA keypair:*

. Use https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/genrsa.html[OpenSSL] to generate an RSA private key:
+
--
[source,sh]
----
openssl genrsa -out example-private-key.pem 3072
openssl genrsa -passout pass:foobar -out example-private-key-with-password.pem 3072 <1>
----
<1> Use the `passout` option to set a password on your private key. This is optional but remember your password if you set one.
--

. Use https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/req.html[OpenSSL] to generate the matching public key:
+
--
[source,sh]
----
openssl req -new -x509 -key example-private-key.pem -out example-sn-cert.pem -days 360
----
--
// end::servicenow-rsa-key[]
// tag::servicenow-certificate[]
*Add an X.509 certificate to ServiceNow:*

. In your {sn} instance, go to *Certificates* and select *New*.
. Configure the certificate as follows:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/servicenow-sir-update-connector.png[Shows deprecated ServiceNow connectors]

IMPORTANT: Deprecated connectors will continue to function with the rules they were added to and can be assigned to new rules. However, it is strongly recommended to update deprecated connectors or <<creating-new-connector, create new ones>> to ensure you have access to connector enhancements, such as updating incidents.

To update a deprecated connector:

. Open the main menu and go to *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*.
. Select the deprecated connector to open the *Edit connector* flyout.
. In the warning message, click *Update this connector*.
. Complete the guided steps in the *Edit connector* flyout.
.. Install https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/7148dbc91bf1f450ced060a7234bcb88[Elastic for ITSM] and complete the <<servicenow-itsm-connector-prerequisites, required prerequisites>>.
.. Enter the URL of your {sn} instance.
.. Enter the username and password of your {sn} instance.
. Click *Update*.

[[servicenow-action-configuration]]
=== Action configuration

{sn-itsm} actions have the following configuration properties.

Urgency::              The extent to which the incident resolution can delay.
Severity::             The severity of the incident.
Impact::               The effect an incident has on business. Can be measured by the number of affected users or by how critical it is to the business in question.
Category::             The category of the incident.
Subcategory::          The category of the incident.
Correlation ID::            Connectors using the same Correlation ID will be associated with the same {sn} incident. This value determines whether a new {sn} incident will be created or an existing one is updated. Modifying this value is optional; if not modified, the rule ID and alert ID are combined as `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` to form the Correlation ID value in {sn}. The maximum character length for this value is 100 characters.

NOTE: Using the default configuration of `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` ensures that {sn} will create a separate incident record for every generated alert that uses a unique alert ID. If the rule generates multiple alerts that use the same alert IDs, {sn} creates and continually updates a single incident record for the alert.

Correlation Display::  A descriptive label of the alert for correlation purposes in {sn}.
Short description::    A short description for the incident, used for searching the contents of the knowledge base.
Description::          The details about the incident.
Additional comments::  Additional information for the client, such as how to troubleshoot the issue.
