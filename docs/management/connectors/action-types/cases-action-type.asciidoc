To use this connector you must have `All` {kib} privileges for the *Cases* feature.
Depending on the type of rule you want to create and its role visibility, you must have privileges for *Management* or *{observability}* case features.
For more details, refer to <<kibana-privileges>>.

You cannot manage this connector in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}* or by using APIs.
You also cannot create a Cases <<pre-configured-connectors,preconfigured connector>>.
It is available only when you're creating a rule in {kib}.

==== Connector configuration

Cases connectors have the following configuration properties:

Group by alert field::
By default, all alerts are attached to the same case.
You can optionally choose a field to use for grouping the alerts; a unique case is created for each group.

Reopen when the case is closed::
If this option is enabled, closed cases are re-opened when an alert occurs.

Time window::
By default, alerts are added to an existing case only if they occur within a 7 day time window.
