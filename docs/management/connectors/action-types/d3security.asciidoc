:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [configure]

The D3 Security connector uses https://github.com/axios/axios[axios] to send a POST request to a D3 Security endpoint. The connector uses the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> to send the request. You can use the connector for rule actions.

To create this connector, you must first configure a webhook key in your D3 SOAR environment. For configuration tips, refer to <<configure-d3security>>.
