=== Actions

Once the Tines connector has been configured in an alerting rule:

It will send a POST request to the Tines webhook action on every action that runs with at least one result.

[[webhookUrlFallback-tines-configuration]]
==== Webhook URL fallback

It is possible that requests to the Tines API to get the stories and webhooks for the selectors hit the 500 results limit. In this scenario, the webhook URL fallback text field will be displayed.
You can still use the selectors if the story or webhook exists in the 500 options loaded. Otherwise, you can paste the webhook URL in the test input field; it can be copied from the Tines webhook configuration. 

When the webhook URL is defined, the connector will use it directly when an action runs, and the story and webhook selectors will be disabled and ignored. To re-enable the story and webhook selectors, remove the webhook URL value.

[[tines-story-library]]
=== Tines Story Libary

In order to simplify the integration with Elastic, Tines offers a set of pre-defined Elastic stories in the Story library.
They can be found by searching for "Elastic" in the https://www.tines.com/story-library?s=elastic[Tines Story library]:

They can be imported directly into your Tines tenant.

=== Format

Tines connector will send the data in JSON format.

The message contains fields such as `alertId`, `date`, `_index`, `kibanaBaseUrl`, along with the `rule` and `params` objects. 

The number of alerts (signals) can be found at `state.signals_count`.

The alerts (signals) data is stored in the `context.alerts` array, following the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html[ECS] format.
