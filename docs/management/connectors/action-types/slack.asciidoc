The Slack connector uses incoming webhooks or an API method to send Slack messages.

=== Create connectors in {kib}

You can create connectors in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}* or as needed when you're creating a rule.
You can choose to use a webhook URL that's specific to a single channel. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/slack-webhook-connector.png[Slack connector]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

Alternatively, you can create a connector that supports multiple channels.
For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/slack-api-connector.png[Slack API connector]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

If you use the latter method, you must provide a valid list of Slack channel IDs.
When you create a rule, each action can communicate with one of these channels.

For Slack setup details, go to <<configuring-slack>>.

=== Test connectors

You can test connectors as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}.
For the webhook type of connector, its message text cannot contain Markdown, images, or other advanced formatting:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/slack-webhook-params.png[Slack webhook connector test]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

For the web API type of connector, you must choose one of the channel IDs.
You can then test either plain text or block kit messages:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/slack-api-connector-test.png[Slack web API connector test]

After you add block kit messages you can click a link to preview them in the Slack block kit builder.

=== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings,Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings.
You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.

=== Configure a Slack account

Before you can create a Slack connector, you must configure your account and obtain the necessary URL or token.

[[configuring-slack-webhook]]
==== Configure a Slack account for incoming webhooks

. Log in to http://slack.com[slack.com] as a team administrator.
. Create a Slack app, enable incoming webhooks, then create an incoming webhook. Refer to https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks.
. Copy the generated webhook URL so you can paste it into your Slack connector form.
. If you are using the <<action-settings,`xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure the hostname from the URL is added to the allowed hosts.

[[configuring-slack-web-api]]
==== Configure a Slack account for Web API

. Create a Slack app. Refer to https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#creating.
. Add scope: `channels:read`, `groups:read`, `chat:write` and `chat:write.public`. Refer to https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#scopes.
. Install the app to a workspace. Refer to https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#installing.
. Copy the `Bot User OAuth Token` so you can paste it into your Slack connector form.
. If you need to send messages to a private channel, you need to write `/invite @App_name` in it.
  Putting "@" triggers Slack to start auto-suggesting, which is why it then becomes easy to find your app name in the list.
. To find a channel ID (for example, `C123ABC456`), view the channel details.
