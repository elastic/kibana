Slack connectors have a name and either a webhook URL or an API token.
To set up your Slack account and obtain these values, go to <<configuring-slack>>.

[[preconfigured-slack-configuration]]
=== Create preconfigured connectors

If you are running {kib} on-prem, you can define connectors by
adding `xpack.actions.preconfigured` settings to your `kibana.yml` file.

--
xpack.actions.preconfigured:
  my-slack:
    name: preconfigured-slack-connector-type
    actionTypeId: .slack
    config:

    secrets:
      webhookUrl: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxx/xxxx/xxxx' <1>

You can test connectors with the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or

[[slack-connector-networking-configuration]]

=== Configure a Slack account

Before you can create a Slack connector, you must configure your account and obtain the necessary URL or token.

[[configuring-slack-webhook]]
==== Configure a Slack account with Webhook

. Log in to http://slack.com[slack.com] as a team administrator.
. Follow first 3 paragraphs of https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks.
. Copy the generated webhook URL so you can paste it into your Slack connector form.
. If you are using the <<action-settings,`xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure the hostname from the URL is added to the allowed hosts.

[[configuring-slack-web-api]]
==== Configure a Slack account with Web API

. Create a Slack app. Refer to https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#creating.
. Add scope: `channels:read`, `groups:read`, `chat:write` and `chat:write.public`. Refer to https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#scopes.
. Install the app to a workspace. Refer to https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#installing.
. Copy the `Bot User OAuth Token` so you can paste it into your Slack connector form.
. If you need to send messages to a private channel, you need to write `/invite @App_name` in it.
  Putting "@" triggers Slack to start auto-suggesting, which is why it then becomes easy to find your app name in the list.
