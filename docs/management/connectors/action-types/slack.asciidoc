==== Connector configuration

Slack connectors have the following configuration properties:

Name::      The name of the connector.
Webhook URL::   The URL of the incoming webhook. See https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#getting_started[Slack Incoming Webhooks] for instructions on generating this URL. If you are using the <<action-settings, `xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure the hostname is added to the allowed hosts.

[[preconfigured-slack-configuration]]
=== Create preconfigured connectors

If you are running {kib} on-prem, you can define connectors by
adding `xpack.actions.preconfigured` settings to your `kibana.yml` file.
For example:

[source,text]
--
xpack.actions.preconfigured:
  my-slack:
    name: preconfigured-slack-connector-type
    actionTypeId: .slack
    secrets:
      webhookUrl: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/abcd/efgh/ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
--

Secrets defines sensitive information for the connector type.

`webhookUrl`:: A string that corresponds to *Webhook URL*.
