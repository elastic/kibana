:frontmatter-description: Add a connector that can send requests to {gemini}.
:frontmatter-tags-products: [kibana] 
:frontmatter-tags-content-type: [how-to] 
:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [configure]


The {gemini} connector uses https://github.com/axios/axios[axios] to send a POST request to {gemini}. The connector uses the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> to send the request.

=== Create connectors in {kib}

You can create connectors in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*.  For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/gemini-connector.png[{gemini} connector]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

==== Connector configuration

{gemini} connectors have the following configuration properties:

Name::      The name of the connector.
API URL::   The {gemini} request URL.
Project ID:: The project which has Vertex AI endpoint enabled.
Region:: The GCP region where the Vertex AI endpoint enabled.
Default model:: The GAI model for {gemini} to use. Current support is for the Google Gemini models, defaulting to gemini-1.5-pro-001. The model can be set on a per request basis by including a "model" parameter alongside the request body.
Credentials JSON:: The GCP service account JSON file for authentication.

=== Test connectors

You can test connectors with the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or
as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/gemini-params.png[{gemini} params test]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

The {gemini} actions have the following configuration properties.

Body::      A stringified JSON payload sent to the {gemini} invoke model API. For example:
+
[source,text]
--

{
  body: JSON.stringify({
        contents: [{
            role: user,
            parts: [{ text: 'Write the first line of a story about a magic backpack.' }]
        }],
        generation_config: {
            temperature: 0,
            maxOutputTokens: 8192
        }
  })
}
--
Model::      An optional string that overwrites the connector's default model.

[[gemini-connector-networking-configuration]]
=== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.
