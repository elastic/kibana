=== Preconfigured connectors

You can preconfigure a connector to have all the information it needs prior to startup by adding it to the `kibana.yml` file.

Preconfigured connectors offer the following benefits:

- Require no setup. Configuration and credentials needed to execute an
action are predefined, including the connector name and ID.
- Appear in all spaces because they are not saved objects.
- Cannot be edited or deleted.

==== Preconfigured connectors example

This example shows a valid configuration for
two out-of-the box connectors: <<slack-action-type, Slack>> and <<webhook-action-type, Webhook>>.

```js
  xpack.actions.preconfigured:
    my-slack1:                  <1>
      actionTypeId: .slack      <2>
      name: 'Slack #xyz'        <3>
      secrets:
        webhookUrl: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/abcd/efgh/ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    webhook-service:
      actionTypeId: .webhook
      name: 'Email service'
      config:                   <4>
        url: 'https://email-alert-service.elastic.co'
        method: post
        headers:
          header1: value1
          header2: value2
      secrets:                  <5>
        user: elastic
        password: changeme
```

<1>  The key is the connector identifier, `my-slack1` in this example.
<2> `actionTypeId` is the action type identifier.
<3> `name` is the name of the preconfigured connector.
<4> `config` is the configuration specific to the connector type.
<5> `secrets` is the sensitive configuration, such as username, password, and keys, specific to the connector type.

[NOTE]
==============================================
Sensitive properties, such as passwords, can also be stored in the <<creating-keystore, {kib} keystore>>.

Clicking a preconfigured connector shows the description, but not the configuration. A message indicates that this is a preconfigured connector.
