== Preconfigured connectors

If you are running {kib} on-prem, you can preconfigure a connector to have all
the information it needs prior to startup by adding it to the `kibana.yml` file.

NOTE: {ess} provides a preconfigured email connector but you cannot create
additional preconfigured connectors.

Preconfigured connectors offer the following benefits:

- Require no setup. Configuration and credentials needed to run an action are
predefined, including the connector name and ID.
- Appear in all spaces because they are not saved objects.
- Cannot be edited or deleted.

=== Create preconfigured connectors

Add `xpack.actions.preconfigured` settings to your `kibana.yml` file. The
settings vary depending on which type of connector you're adding.

This example shows a valid configuration for a Slack connector and a Webhook
connector:

```js
  xpack.actions.preconfigured:
    my-slack1:                  <1>
      actionTypeId: .slack      <2>
      name: 'Slack #xyz'        <3>
      secrets:
        webhookUrl: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/abcd/efgh/ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    webhook-service:
      actionTypeId: .webhook
      name: 'Email service'
      config:                   <4>
        url: 'https://email-alert-service.elastic.co'
        method: post
        headers:
          header1: value1
          header2: value2
      secrets:                  <5>
        user: elastic
        password: changeme
```

<1>  The key is the connector identifier, `my-slack1` in this example.
<2> `actionTypeId` is the action type identifier.
<3> `name` is the name of the preconfigured connector.
<4> `config` is the configuration specific to the connector type.
<5> `secrets` is the sensitive configuration, such as username, password, and keys, specific to the connector type.

[NOTE]
==============================================
Sensitive properties, such as passwords, can also be stored in the 
<<creating-keystore,{kib} keystore>>.

[[managing-pre-configured-connectors]]
=== View preconfigured connectors

When you open the main menu, click *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*. 
Preconfigured connectors appear regardless of which space you are in.
They are tagged as “preconfigured”, and you cannot delete them.

Clicking a preconfigured connector shows the description, but not the configuration.

[[build-in-preconfigured-connectors]]
=== Built-in preconfigured connectors

{kib} provides the following built-in preconfigured connectors:

* <<preconfigured-connector-alert-history>>
* <<elasticcloud,`Elastic-Cloud-SMTP` preconfigured email connector>>

[float]
[[preconfigured-connector-alert-history]]
==== Preconfigured alert history {es} index connector

preview::[]

{kib} offers a preconfigured index connector to facilitate indexing active alert data into {es}.
To use this connector, set <<action-settings,`xpack.actions.preconfiguredAlertHistoryEsIndex`>> to `true`.

When you subsequently create rules, you can use the `Alert history Elasticsearch index (preconfigured)` connector.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/pre-configured-alert-history-connector.png[Creating a rule action that uses the pre-configured alert history connector]

Documents are indexed using a preconfigured schema that captures the <<defining-rules-actions-variables,action variables>> available for the rule.
By default, these documents are indexed into the `kibana-alert-history-default` index, but you can specify a different index.
Index names must start with `kibana-alert-history-` to take advantage of the preconfigured alert history index template.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* To write documents to the preconfigured index, you must have `all` or `write` privileges to the `kibana-alert-history-*` indices.
* The `kibana-alert-history-*` indices are not configured to use ILM so they must be maintained manually. If the index size grows large, consider using the {ref}/docs-delete-by-query.html[delete by query] API to clean up older documents in the index.

<5> A valid user name. Required if `hasAuth` is set to `true`.
<6> A valid password. Required if `hasAuth` is set to `true`. NOTE: This value should be stored in the <<creating-keystore,{kib} keystore>>.
