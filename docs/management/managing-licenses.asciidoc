The 30-day trial enables you to try out the full set of
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Platinum features],
including security, machine learning, alerting, graph capabilities,
and more. For example, the following pages are added to the side navigation:

* **Machine Learning**
* **Graph**

The **Management** page gains options related to configuring security, managing 
{ls} pipelines, and using {watcher}. 

At the end of the trial period, your license reverts
to a Basic license. To continue using the Platinum features,
purchase a subscription and update your license.
