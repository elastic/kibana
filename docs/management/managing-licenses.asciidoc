The 30-day trial enables you to try out the full set of
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Platinum features],
including security, machine learning, alerting, graph capabilities,
and more.

At the end of the trial period, your license reverts
to a Basic license. To continue using the Platinum features,
purchase a subscription and update your license.
