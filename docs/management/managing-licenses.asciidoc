When you install {kib}, it generates a Basic license
with no expiration date.  To start a 30-day trial,
view the status of your license, or install a new license

The 30-day trial enables you to try out the full set of
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Platinum features],
including security, machine learning, alerting, graph capabilities,
and more. For example, the following pages are added to the side navigation:

* **Machine Learning**
* **Graph**

The **Management** page gains options related to configuring security, managing 
{ls} pipelines, and using {watcher}. 

At the end of the trial period, the Platinum features operate in a 
{stack-ov}/license-expiration.html[degraded mode]. You can revert to a Basic 
license, extend the trial, or purchase a subscription. 

For a comparison of the Elastic license levels,
see https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[the subscription page]. 

TIP: If {security} is enabled, before you can install a gold or platinum 
license, you must configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) in {es}. See 
{stack-ov}/encrypting-communications.html[Encrypting communications].
