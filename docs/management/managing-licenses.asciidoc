== License management

When you install the default distribution of {kib}, you receive a basic license
with no expiration date. For the full list of free features that are included in
the basic license, see https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[the subscription page].

If you want to try out the full set of platinum features, you can activate a
30-day trial license. Go to *Management > License Management* to view the 
status of your license, start a trial, or install a new license.

NOTE: You can start a trial only if your cluster has not already activated a
trial license for the current major product version. For example, if you have
already activated a trial for v6.0, you cannot start a new trial until 
v7.0. You can, however, contact `info@elastic.co` to request an extended trial
license.

When you activate a new license level, new features appear in the left sidebar 
of the *Management* page.

At the end of the trial period, the platinum features operate in a
<<license-expiration,degraded mode>>. You can revert to a basic license, 
extend the trial, or purchase a subscription. 

TIP: If {security-features} are enabled, before you revert to a basic license or
install a gold or platinum license, you must configure Transport Layer Security
(TLS) in {es}. See {ref}/encrypting-communications.html[Encrypting communications].
{kib} and the {ref}/start-basic.html[start basic API] provide a list of all of
the features that will no longer be supported if you revert to a basic license.

[[update-license]]
=== Update your license

You can update your license at runtime without shutting down your {es} nodes.
License updates take effect immediately. The license is provided as a _JSON_
file that you install in {kib} or by using the
{ref}/update-license.html[update license API].

TIP: If you are using a basic or trial license, {security-features} are disabled
by default. In all other licenses, {security-features} are enabled by default;
you must secure the {stack} or disable the {security-features}.
