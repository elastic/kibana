[[managing-licenses]]
== License Management

When you install the default distribution of {kib}, you receive free features
with no expiration date. For the full list of features, refer to
{subscriptions}.

If you want to try out the full set of features, you can activate a free 30-day
trial. To view the status of your license, start a trial, or install a new
license, open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > License Management*.

NOTE: You can start a trial only if your cluster has not already activated a
trial license for the current major product version. For example, if you have
already activated a trial for 6.0, you cannot start a new trial until
7.0. You can, however, request an extended trial at {extendtrial}.

When you activate a new license level, new features appear in *Stack Management*.

At the end of the trial period, some features operate in a
<<license-expiration,degraded mode>>. You can revert to Basic, extend the trial,
or purchase a subscription.

TIP: If {security-features} are enabled, unless you have a trial license,
you must configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) in {es}.
See {ref}/encrypting-communications.html[Encrypting communications].
{kib} and the {ref}/start-basic.html[start basic API] provide a list of all of
the features that will no longer be supported if you revert to a basic license.

=== Required permissions

The `manage` cluster privilege is required to access *License Management*.

To add the privilege, open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Roles*.

[[update-license]]
=== Update your license

You can update your license at runtime without shutting down your {es} nodes.
License updates take effect immediately. The license is provided as a _JSON_
file that you install in {kib} or by using the
{ref}/update-license.html[update license API].

TIP: If you are using a basic or trial license, {security-features} are disabled
by default. In all other licenses, {security-features} are enabled by default;
you must secure the {stack} or disable the {security-features}.

[[license-expiration]]
=== License expiration

Your license is time based and expires at a future date. If you're using
{monitor-features} and your license will expire within 30 days, a license
expiration warning is displayed prominently. Warnings are also displayed on
startup and written to the {es} log starting 30 days from the expiration date.
These error messages tell you when the license expires and what features will be
disabled if you do not update the license.

IMPORTANT: You should update your license as soon as possible. You are
essentially flying blind when running with an expired license. Access to the
cluster health and stats APIs is critical for monitoring and managing an {es}
cluster.
