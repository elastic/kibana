=== Create Threshold Alert

You can create a threshold alert to periodically check when your data goes above or below a certain threshold within a given time interval. It's one of the most common type of alerts that you can create using Watcher. For more advanced watches, see the <<watcher-create-advanced-watch>>.

To create a new threshold alert:

. Select the `Create new watch` button
image:management/watcher-ui/images/create-watch-select.png["Create a Watch",link="management/watcher-ui/images/create-watch-select.png"]

. Select `Threshold Alert`

Next, let's look at the UI and how to use it.

==== Inputs & Triggers

To create a threshold alert, you need to first configure the inputs and triggers.

. Add a `name` for the alert.
. Choose one or more indices that have a time-based field as the alert input.
. Configure a trigger interval.

Next, you will be able to specify the conditions to trigger the alert.

==== Condition

Here, you can configure the condition that will cause alert to trigger. The UI is interactive and selecting the various elements within the expression will display a UI to change the values.

Let's look at a few examples of common alerts based on x-pack monitoring data:

* High heap usage:

* System load:

Here are some specifics of how the visualization works:

* The time window that is used in the visualization is calculated by taking the duration defined in the expression and multiplying it by 5. So, if you select `FOR THE LAST 5 hours`, the visualization will show data from the last 25 hours.

* In the chart, you will see a blue line that represents the aggregated data. There is also a red line that represents the threshold value.

* If you use the `terms` aggregation to aggregate over a specific field, there will be multiple visualizations available and pagination controls will appear as shown below.

==== Actions

Here you can configure the various actions that will occur when the alert fires.

Click `Add new action` to trigger a dropdown selection:

image:management/watcher-ui/images/threshold-alert/threshold-alert-select-action.png["Threshold Alert Select Action",link="management/watcher-ui/images/threshold-alert/threshold-alert-select-action.png"]

Selecting an action will allow you to customize settings for the respective action.

All fields for an alert support using http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html[mustache syntax] and expose a `{{ctx}}` variable which exposes {stack-ov}/condition-script.html#accessing-watch-payload[various properties of the alert]

The supported actions are:

* {stack-ov}/actions-slack.html[Slack]
* {stack-ov}/actions-logging.html[Logging]
* {stack-ov}/actions-email.html[Email]

Note that certain actions require configuration within {es}, such as 
{stack-ov}/actions-email.html#configuring-email[email] and 
{stack-ov}/actions-slack.html#configuring-slack[slack].
