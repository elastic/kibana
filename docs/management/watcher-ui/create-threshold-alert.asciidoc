=== Create a threshold alert

A threshold alert is one of the most common types of watches that you can create.  
This alert periodically checks when your data is above, below, equals, 
or is in between a certain threshold within a given time interval.

The following example walks you through creating a threshold alert. The alert 
is triggered when the maximum total CPU usage on a machine goes above a 
certain percentage. The example uses https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/metricbeat[Metricbeat] 
to collect metrics from your systems and services.

and get started with Metricbeat.

==== Get started

. Go to *Management > Elasticsearch > Watcher*.

. Click *Create* and then select *Create threshold alert*.

==== Define the watch input and schedule

You're navigated to a page that walks you through creating the alert.
You're asked to define the watch name, the data that you want to evaluate, and
how often you want to trigger the watch. 

. Enter a name that you want to call the alert, for example, `cpu_threshold_alert`.

. In the *Indices to query* field, enter `metricbeat-*` and select `@timestamp` 
as the time field. 

. Use the default schedule to run the watch every 1 minute.

==== Add a condition

You should now see a panel with default conditions and a visualization of the 
data based on those conditions. The condition evaluates the data you’ve loaded 
into the watch and determines if any action is required.

. Click the `WHEN` expression and change the value to `max()`. 
+
The `OF` expression now appears.  

. Search for `system.process.cpu.total.norm.pct` and select it from the list. 


. Select the `IS ABOVE` expression and change the value to `.25` to trigger 
an alert whenever the CPU is above 25%.
+
As you change the condition, the visualization is automatically updated. The black 
line represents the threshold (25%), while the green fluctuating line 
represents the change in CPU over the set time period.

==== Add an action

Now that the condition is set, you must add an action. The action triggers 
when the watch condition is met. For a complete list of actions and how to configure them, see 
{stack-ov}/action-conditions.html[Adding conditions to actions].

In this example, you’ll configure an email action. You must have an {stack-ov}/actions-email.html#configuring-email[email account configured]
in {es} for this example to work. 

. Click *Add action* and select *Email*.

. In the *To email address* field, enter one or more email addresses to whom 
you want to send the message when the condition is met. 

. Enter a subject and body for the email.

. To test the action before saving the watch, click *Send test email*. 
+
A sample email is sent using the configuration you set up.

. Click *Create alert*.  
+
The alert appears on the Watcher overview page, where you can drill down into 
the watch history and status.

==== Delete the alert

In this example, you set the threshold to 25% so you can see the watch fire. In 
a  real-world scenario, this threshold is likely too low because the alerts are 
so frequent. Once you are done experimenting, you should delete the alert. 
Find the alert on the Watcher overview page and click the trash icon in the *Actions* column.

==== Edit the alert

Alternatively, you can keep the alert and adjust the threshold value. To edit 
an alert, find the alert on the Watcher overview page and click the pencil icon 
in the *Actions* column.
