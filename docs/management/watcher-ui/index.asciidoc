== Watcher

Watcher is an {es} feature that you can use to create actions based on 
conditions, which are periodically evaluated using queries on your data. 
Watches are helpful for analyzing mission-critical and business-critical 
streaming data. For example, you might watch application logs for performance 
outages or audit access logs for security threats.

With the Watcher UI, you can:

* Create a simple threshold watch
* View your watch history and action status
* Edit, deactivate, and delete a watch
* Create more advanced watches using API syntax

{stack-ov}/xpack-alerting.html[Alerting on cluster and index events]
is a good source for detailed 
information on how watches work. If you are using the UI to create a 
threshold watch, take a look at the different watcher actions. If you are 
creating an advanced watch, you should be familiar with the parts of a 
watch&#8212;input, schedule, condition, and actions.

=== Watcher security

If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the
{stack-ov}/security-privileges.html[`manage_watcher` or `monitor_watcher`]
cluster privileges to use Watcher in {kib}.

Alternately, you can have the built-in `kibana_user` role
and either of these watcher roles:

* `watcher_admin`. You can perform all Watcher actions, including create and edit watches.
* `watcher_user`. You can view watches, but not create or edit them.

You can manage roles in *Management > Security > Roles*, or use the 
<<role-management-api, Kibana Role Management API>>. Watches are shared between 
all users with the same role.  

NOTE: If you are creating a threshold watch, you must also have index management 
privileges.  See 
<<managing-indices, Managing Indices>> for detailed information.
