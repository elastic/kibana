== Watcher

Watcher is an {es} feature that you can use to create actions based on 
conditions, which are periodically evaluated, using queries on your data. 
Watches are helpful for analyzing mission-critical and business-critical 
streaming data. For example, you might watch application logs for performance 
outages or audit access logs for security threats.

With the Watcher UI, you can:

* Create a simple threshold watch
* View your watch history and action status
* Acknowledge a watch to prevent too many executions
* Edit, deactivate, and delete a watch
* Create more advanced watches using API syntax

{stack-ov}/xpack-alerting.html[Alerting on cluster and index events]
is a good source for detailed 
information on how watches work. If you are using the UI to create a 
threshold watch, take a look at the different watcher actions. If you are 
creating an advanced watch, you should be familiar with the parts of a 
watch&#8212;input, schedule, condition, and actions.

=== Required roles for Watcher

To use Watcher, you must have the built-in `kibana_user` role.  
You must also have one of the following Watcher roles:

* `watcher_admin` can perform all Watcher actions, such as creating a new watch 
or editing an existing one.

* `watcher_user` can view all existing watches, but cannot create or edit watches.

You can manage roles in *Management > Security > Roles*, or use the 
<<role-management-api, Kibana Role Management API>>. Watches are shared between 
all users with the same role.  

NOTE: If you are creating a threshold watch, you must also have index management 
privileges.  See 
<<managing-indices, Managing Indices>> for detailed information.
