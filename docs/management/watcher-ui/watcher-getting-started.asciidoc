=== View watch history and status
The Watcher overview page lists all your watches,
including their state: `Firing`, `Error`, `OK`, or `Disabled`.
From this page you can drill down into a watch to investigate its history
and status.

==== View watch history

The *Execution history* tab shows each time the watch is triggered and the 
results of the query, whether the condition was met, and what actions were taken.

==== Acknowledge action status

The *Action statuses* tab lists all actions associated with the watch and 
the state of each action. If the action is firing, you can acknowledge the 
watch to prevent too many executions of the same action for the same watch. 
See {stack-ov}/actions.html#actions-ack-throttle[Acknowledgement and Throttling] for details.

==== Deactivate and delete a watch

Actions for deactivating and deleting a watch are on each watch detail page:

* *Deactivate a watch* if you know a situation is planned that will 
cause a false alarm. You can reactivate the watch when the situation is resolved. 
* *Delete a watch* to permanently remove it from the system. You can delete 
the watch you are currently viewing, or go to the Watcher overview, and 
delete watches in bulk.
