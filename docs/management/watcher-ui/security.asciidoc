=== Watcher UI Security

The Watcher UI requires a user with `kibana_user` and the user must have either `watcher_admin` _or_ `watcher_user`.

`watcher_admin` can perform all watcher-related actions, such as creating a new watch or editing an existing one.

`watcher_user` can view all existing watches, but is not able to create or edit watches.
