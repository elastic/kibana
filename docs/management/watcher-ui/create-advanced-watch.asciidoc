=== Create an advanced watch

Advanced watches are for users who are more familiar with {es} query syntax and 
the Watcher framework. The UI is aligned with using the REST APIs. 
For more information, see {ref}/query-dsl.html[Query DSL].

==== Create the watch

On the Watch overview page, click *Create* and choose *Create advanced watch*.  
An advanced watch requires a name and ID.  `Name` is a user-friendly way to 
identify the watch, and `ID` refers to the identifier used by {es}.  Refer to 
{stack-ov}/how-watcher-works.html#watch-definition[Watch definition] for how 
to input the watch JSON.

==== Simulate the watch

The *Simulate* tab allows you to override parts of the watch, and then run a 
simulation. Be aware of these implementation details on overrides:

* Trigger overrides use {ref}/common-options.html#date-math[date math].
* Input overrides accepts a JSON blob.
* Condition overrides indicates if you want to force the condition to always be `true`.
* Action overrides support {ref}/watcher-api-execute-watch.html#watcher-api-execute-watch-action-mode[multiple options].

After starting the simulation, youâ€™ll see a results screen. For more information 
on the fields in the response, see the {ref}//watcher-api-execute-watch.html[Execute Watch API].
