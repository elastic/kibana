=== Create a visualization using rolled up data

beta[]

You can visualize your rolled up data in a variety of charts, tables, maps, and 
more. Most visualizations support rolled up data, with the exception of 
Timelion, Visual Builder, and Vega visualizations. 

You create an index pattern for rolled up data the same way you do for any data, 
in *Management > Kibana > Index patterns*. Clicking *Create index pattern* includes 
an item for creating a rollup index pattern, if a rollup index is detected in the cluster.

You can match an index pattern to only rolled up data, or mix both rolled up 
and raw data to visualize all data together.  An index pattern can match only one 
rolled up index, not multiple. There is no restriction on the number of standard 
indices that an index pattern can match. 

Combination index patterns use the same 
notation as other multiple indices in {es}. To match multiple indices to create a 
combination index pattern, use a comma to separate the names, with no space after the comma. 
The notation for wildcards (`*`) and the ability to "exclude" (`-`) also apply 
(for example, `test*,-test3`).

When creating an index pattern, you’re asked to set a time field for filtering.  
With a rollup index, the time filter field is the same field used for 
the rolled up date histogram aggregation.

Keep the following in mind when creating a visualization from rolled up data:

* The data in a rollup index only has summarized metrics for specific fields. 
You can’t search any other field from the original raw data. 
* Data is summarized into time buckets that might be split into sub buckets for 
numeric field values or terms. You can ask for a time aggregation that takes 
several time buckets and combines them to lower granularity. For example, 
if the rollup job was aggregated by hours, you can ask for buckets of days.

The data represented in this visualization comes from a rollup index and 
standard indices.

You can mix rollup visualizations and regular visualizations in a dashboard. 
The following dashboard shows this mix, along with a field filter. Note
that not all queries and filters are supported by rollups.
