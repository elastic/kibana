== Working with rollup indices

The {ref}/xpack-rollup.html[rollup feature in {es}]
enables you to summarize historical data and store it compactly for future analysis, 
so you can query, aggregate, and visualize the data using a fraction of the storage. 
This is a good way to keep costs down when you need to store months or years of 
historical data for use in visualizations and reports.  

{kib} supports rolled up data in two ways:

* You can create and manage a rollup job in Management
* You can create a visualization using rolled up data in 
Visualize and view it in a dashboard

=== Create and manage rollup jobs

In Management, you'll find a UI for viewing, creating, starting, stopping, and 
deleting rollup jobs. A rollup job is a periodic task that summarizes data from 
indices specified by an index pattern and rolls it into a new index. To navigate 
to the UI, go to *Management*, and under *Elasticsearch*, click *Rollup Jobs*.

==== Creating a rollup job

{kib} makes it easy for you to create a rollup job by walking you through the 
process step by step. The first step is to define the job logistics. These include 
the name of the rollup job, the index or indices to summarize, and the output rollup index.  

The index pattern cannot match the name of the output rollup index. For example,
if your index pattern is `metricbeat-*`, you cannot name your rollup index
`metricbeat-rollup`.  Otherwise, the job will attempt to capture the data in the 
rollup index.

You must set a schedule for the rollup job: how often to collect the data, 
the number of documents to roll up at a time, and the duration of its latency. 
The latency buffer field is provided to protect against the late arrival of data 
from Beats or other sources. By delaying the rollup for the specified amount of 
time from when the job starts, you allow for the inclusion of late-arriving data 
in the rollup.

In the subsequent phases, you define the Date Histogram aggregation for the job 
and optionally the Terms and Histogram aggregations.

* The Date Histogram aggregation defines the time intervals for summarizing the data. 
This value is important because you cannot search the data with a smaller value 
than this interval. However, you can aggregate buckets in a larger time interval. 

* The Terms histogram enables you to split the time buckets into sub buckets for 
term field values. 

* The Histogram aggregation enables you to split the time buckets into sub buckets 
for numeric field values. 

The final step is to specify the fields for calculating metrics. For each selected 
field, you can collect any or all of the following: value count, average, sum, min, and max.

Before you save the rollup job, {kib} displays a summary of the rollup job for 
validation.

==== Managing rollup jobs

Selecting a job on the *Rollup jobs* page shows its details. The Manage menu in 
the lower right enables you to start, stop, and delete the rollup job.
You must first stop a rollup job before deleting it.

You can start, stop, and delete an existing rollup job, but edits are not supported. 
If you want to make any changes, delete the existing job and create a new one with 
the updated specifications. Be sure to use a different name for the new rollup job; 
reusing the same name could lead to problems with mismatched job configurations. 
More about logistical details for the {ref}/rollup-job-config.html[rollup job configuration] 
can be found in the {es} documentation.
