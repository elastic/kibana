== Saved objects

Saved objects store your visualizations, dashboards, maps, Canvas workpads, and more.
You can view, edit, delete, import, and export saved objects in 
*Management > Kibana > Saved Objects*.

=== View, edit, and delete

* To view and edit an object in its associated application, click the object title.

* To show objects that use this object, so you know the 
impact of deleting it, click the actions icon image:images/actions_icon.png[Actions icon] 
and select *Relationships*.

* To delete one or more objects, select their checkboxes and click *Delete*.

=== Import and export

Using the import and export commands, you can move objects between different 
{kib} instances. This action is useful when you 
have multiple environments for development and production. 

Import and export also work well when you have a large number 
of objects to update and want to batch the process.  
You can export the objects to JSON, make the JSON modification, and re-import 
the objects.

[float]
==== Import

You can import multiple objects in a single operation. Click *Import* and 
navigate to the JSON file that 
represents the objects to import.  By default, 
objects already in {kib} are overwritten.

[float]
==== Export

You have two options for exporting saved objects.

* Select the checkboxes of objects that you want to export, and then click *Export*.
* Click *Export x objects*, and select which object types to export.

This action exports a JSON with all your saved objects.  By default, 
the export includes related objects. 

WARNING: Exported dashboards do not include their associated index patterns.
You must recreate the index patterns manually before importing 
a saved dashboard to a 
{kib} instance running on another {es} cluster.

[[managing-saved-objects-object-definition]]
=== Advanced editing

Some objects offer an advanced *Edit* page for modifying the object definition.
To open the page, click the actions icon image:images/actions_icon.png[Actions icon] 
and select *Inspect*. 
You can change the object title, add a description, and modify 
the JSON that defines the object properties.

If you access an object whose index has been deleted, you can:

* Recreate the index so you can continue using the object.
* Delete the object and recreate it using a different index.
* Change the index name referenced in the object's `kibanaSavedObjectMeta.searchSourceJSON` to point to an existing
index pattern. This is useful if the index you were working with has been renamed.

WARNING: Validation is not performed for object properties. Submitting an invalid 
change will render the object unusable. A more failsafe approach is to use 
*Discover*, *Visualize*, or *Dashboard* to create new objects instead of 
directly editing an existing one.
