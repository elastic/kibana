== Saved Objects

*Saved Objects* helps you keep track of and manage your saved objects. 
These objects store data for later use, including dashboards, visualizations, 
maps, index patterns, Canvas workpads, and more.

To get started, go to *Management > {kib} > Saved Objects*. With this UI, you can:

* <<managing-saved-objects-view, View&#44; edit&#44; and delete saved objects>>
* <<managing-saved-objects-export-objects, Import and export saved objects>>
* <<managing-saved-objects-object-definition, Edit the object definition>>

=== View, edit, and delete objects

* To view and edit an object in its associated application, click the object title.
* To show objects that use this object, so you know the impact of deleting it, 
click the relationships icon image:images/actions_icon.png[Relationships icon].
* To delete one or more objects, select their checkboxes, and then click *Delete*.

=== Import and export

Using the import and export commands, you can move objects between different 
{kib} instances. These actions are useful when you have multiple environments for 
development and production. Import and export also work well when you 
have a large number of objects to update and want to batch the process.

==== Import

You can import multiple objects in a single operation. 
Click *Import* and navigate to the NDJSON file that represents the objects to 
import. By default, saved objects already in Kibana are overwritten.

[float]
==== Export

You have two options for exporting saved objects.

* Select the checkboxes of objects that you want to export, and then click *Export*.
* Click *Export x objects*, and export objects by type.

The export action creates an NDJSON with all your saved objects. By default, the 
NDJSON includes related objects. Exported dashboards include their associated index patterns.

=== Advanced editing

Some objects offer an advanced *Edit* page for modifying the object definition. 
To open the page, click the inspect icon image:images/inspect_icon.png[Inspect icon]. 
You can change the object title, add a description, and modify the JSON 
that defines the object properties.

If you access an object whose index has been deleted, you can:

* Recreate the index so you can continue using the object.
* Delete the object and recreate it using a different index.
* Change the index name in the object's `reference` array to point to an existing
index pattern. This is useful if the index you were working with has been renamed.

WARNING: Validation is not performed for object properties. Submitting an invalid 
change will render the object unusable. A more failsafe approach is to use 
*Discover*, *Visualize*, or *Dashboard* to create new objects instead of 
directly editing an existing one.
