== Remote Clusters

Use *Remote Clusters* to establish a unidirectional
connection from your cluster to other clusters. This functionality is
required for {ref}/xpack-ccr.html[cross-cluster replication] and
{ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[cross-cluster search].

To get started, open the menu, then go to *Stack Management > {es} > Remote Clusters*.

=== Add a remote cluster

A {ref}/modules-remote-clusters.html[remote cluster] connection works by configuring a remote cluster and
connecting to a limited number of nodes, called {ref}/modules-remote-clusters.html#sniff-mode[seed nodes],
in that cluster.
Alternatively, you can define a single proxy address for the remote cluster.

By default, a cross-cluster request, such as a cross-cluster search or
replication request, fails if any cluster in the request is unavailable.
To skip a cluster when its unavailable,
set *Skip if unavailable* to true.

Once you add a remote cluster, you can configure <<managing-cross-cluster-replication, cross-cluster replication>>
to reproduce indices in the remote cluster on a local cluster.

To create an index pattern to search across clusters,
use the same syntax that you’d use in a raw cross-cluster search request in {es}: <cluster-names>:<pattern>.
See <<management-cross-cluster-search, Creating an index pattern>> for examples.

=== Manage remote clusters

From the *Remote Clusters* list view, you can drill down into each cluster and
view its status. You can also edit and delete a cluster.
