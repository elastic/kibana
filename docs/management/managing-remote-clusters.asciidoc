== Working with remote clusters

{kib} *Management* provides two user interfaces for working with data from remote 
clusters. 

*Remote Clusters* helps you manage remote clusters for use with 
{ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[{ccs}] and 
{stack-ov}/xpack-ccr.html[{ccr}]. You can add and remove remote 
clusters and check their connectivity. 

Go to *Management > Elasticsearch > Remote Clusters* to get started.

=== [xpack]#Managing {ccr}#
*{ccr-cap}* includes tools to help you create and manage the {ccr} process.  
You can follow an index pattern on the remote cluster for auto-discovery and then 
replicate new indices in the local cluster that match the auto-follow pattern.
