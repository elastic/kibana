== Working with remote clusters

{kib} *Management* provides user interfaces for working with data from remote 
clusters and managing the {ccr} process. You can replicate indices from a 
leader remote cluster to a follower index in a local cluster. The local follower indices
can be used to provide remote backups for disaster recovery or for geo-proximite copies of data.

Before using these features, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

* {ref}/xpack-ccr.html[{ccr-cap}]
* {ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[{ccs-cap}]
* {ref}/cross-cluster-configuring.html[Cross-cluster security requirements]

== Managing remote clusters 

*Remote clusters* helps you manage remote clusters for use with 
{ccs} and {ccr}. You can add and remove remote clusters and check their connectivity. 

Before you use this feature, you should be familiar with the concept of 
{ref}/modules-remote-clusters.html[remote clusters].  
 
Go to *Management > Elasticsearch > Remote clusters* to create or manage your remotes.

To set up a new remote, click *Add a remote cluster*. Give the cluster a unique name 
and define the seed nodes for cluster discovery. You can edit or remove your remote clusters 
from the *Remote clusters* list view.

Once a remote cluster is registered, you can use the tools under *{ccr-cap}* 
to add and manage follower indices on the local cluster, and replicate data from 
indices on the remote cluster based on an auto-follow index pattern.

== [xpack]#Managing {ccr}#

*{ccr-cap}* helps you create and manage the {ccr} process. 
If you want to replicate data from existing indices, or set up 
local followers on a case-by-case basis, go to *Follower indices*. 
If you want to automatically detect and follow new indices when they are created 
on a remote cluster, you can do so from *Auto-follow patterns*. 

Creating an auto-follow pattern is useful when you have time-series data, like a logs index, on the 
remote cluster that is created or rolled over on a daily basis. Once you have configured an 
auto-follow pattern, any time a new index with a name that matches the pattern is 
created in the remote cluster, a follower index is automatically configured in the local cluster.

From the same view, you can also see a list of your saved auto-follow patterns for 
a given remote cluster, and monitor whether the replication is active.

Before you use these features, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

* {ref}/ccr-requirements.html[Requirements for leader indices] 
* {ref}/ccr-auto-follow.html[Automatically following indices]

To get started, go to *Management > Elasticsearch > {ccr-cap}*.
