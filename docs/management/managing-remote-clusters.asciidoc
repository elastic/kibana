== Managing Remote Clusters

{kib} *Management* provides two user interfaces for working with data from remote 
clusters. 

*Remote Clusters* helps you manage remote clusters for use with 
{ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[cross cluster search] and 
{xpack-ref}/xpack-ccr.html[cross cluster replication]. You can add and remove remote 
clusters and check their connectivity. 

Go to *Management > Elasticsearch > Remote Clusters* to get started.

*Cross Cluster Replication* includes tools to help you create and manage the remote 
replication process.  You can follow an index pattern on the remote cluster for 
auto-discovery and then replicate new indices in the local cluster that match the 
auto-follow pattern.
