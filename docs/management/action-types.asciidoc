== Connectors

Connectors provide a central place to store connection information for services and integrations with third party systems. Actions are instantiations of a connector that are linked to rules and run as background tasks on the {kib} server when rule conditions are met. {kib} provides the following types of connectors:

[[connector-management]]
=== Managing connectors

Rules use connectors to route actions to different destinations like log files, ticketing systems, and messaging tools. While each {kib} app can offer their own types of rules, they typically share connectors. The *Connectors* tab offers a central place to view and manage all the connectors in the current space.

=== Required permissions

Access to connectors is granted based on your privileges to alerting-enabled
features. For more information, go to <<alerting-security>>.

[float]
=== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.

[float]
[[connectors-list]]
=== Connector list

The *Connectors* tab lists all connectors in the current space. The search bar
can be used to find specific connectors by name and type. The *Type* dropdown
also enables you to filter to a subset of connector types.

You can delete individual connectors using the trash icon. Alternatively, select
multiple connectors and delete them in bulk using the *Delete* button.

[NOTE]
============================================================================
You can delete a connector even if there are still actions referencing it.
When this happens the action will fail to run and errors appear in the {kib} logs.

[[creating-new-connector]]
=== Creating a new connector

New connectors can be created with the *Create connector* button, which guides
you to select the type of connector and configure its properties.

After you create a connector, it is available for use any time you set up an
action in the current space.

[[importing-and-exporting-connectors]]
=== Importing and exporting connectors

To import and export connectors, use the
<<managing-saved-objects,Saved Objects Management UI>>.

If a connector is missing sensitive information after the import, a **Fix**
button appears in *{rac-ui}*.

[[create-connectors]]
=== Preconfigured connectors

For out-of-the-box and standardized connectors, you can <<preconfigured-connector-example, preconfigure connectors>>
before {kib} starts.

[float]
[[montoring-connectors]]
=== Monitoring connectors

The <<task-manager-health-monitoring,Task Manager health API>> helps you understand the performance of all tasks in your environment.
However, if connectors fail to run, they will report as successful to Task Manager. The failure stats will not
accurately depict the performance of connectors.

For more information on connector successes and failures, refer to the <<event-log-index,Event log index>>.
