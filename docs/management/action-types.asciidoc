== Connectors

Connectors provide a central place to store connection information for services and integrations with third party systems. Actions are instantiations of a connector that are linked to rules and run as background tasks on the {kib} server when rule conditions are met. {kib} provides the following types of connectors:

[[connector-management]]
=== Managing Connectors

Rules use *Connectors* to route actions to different destinations like log files, ticketing systems, and messaging tools. While each {kib} app can offer their own types of rules, they typically share connectors. The *Connectors* tab offers a central place to view and manage all the connectors in the current space.

For more information on connectors and the types of actions available see <<action-types>>.

Access to connectors is granted based on your privileges to alerting-enabled features. See <<alerting-security, Alerting Security>> for more information.

[[connectors-list]]
=== Connector list

The *Connectors* tab lists all connectors in the current space. The *search bar* can be used to find specific connectors by name and/or type.

The *type* dropdown also lets you filter to a subset of connector types.

You can delete individual connectors using the trash icon. Connectors can also be deleted in bulk by multi-selecting them and clicking the *Delete* button to the left of the search box.

[NOTE]
============================================================================
You can delete a connector even if there are still actions referencing it.
When this happens the action will fail to execute, and appear as errors in the {kib} logs.

=== Creating a new connector

New connectors can be created by clicking the *Create connector* button, which will guide you to select the type of connector and configure its properties. Refer to <<action-types>> for the types of connectors available and how to configure them. Once you create a connector it will be made available to you anytime you set up an action in the current space.
