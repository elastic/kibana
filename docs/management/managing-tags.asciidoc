=== Required permissions

To create tags, you must meet the minimum requirements.

* Access to *Tags* requires the `Tag Management` Kibana privilege. To add the privilege, open the main menu,
and then click *Stack Management > Roles*.
* The `read` privilege allows you to assign tags to the saved objects for which you have write permission.
* The `write` privilege enables you to create, edit, and delete tags.

NOTE: Having the `Tag Management` {kib} privilege is not required to
view tags assigned on objects you have `read` access to, or to filter objects by tags
from the global search.
