== Tags

The *tags* management section allows you to manage your tags, and assign them
to existing saved objects.

Assigning tags to objects helps to categorize them, and allows to easily find
the objects by filtering by tag(s) in the <<managing-saved-objects, Saved Objects management section>>
or from the other applications.

To access the tags management page, open the main menu, then click on *Stack Management > Tags*.

=== Required permissions

The `Tag Management` {kib} privilege is required to access the *Tags* management section.

To add the privilege, open the menu, then click *Stack Management > Roles*.

Having the `read` privilege allows a user to:
- Access the `tags` management section
- Assign tags to saved objects he has `write` permission for

Having the `write` privilege allows a user to additionally:
- Create tags
- Delete tags
- Edit existing tags

NOTE: having the `Tag Management` {kib} privilege is not required to
see tags assigned on objects the user can see, or to filter objects by tags
in {kib} applications or from the navigational search.

NOTE: having `write` `Tag Management` privilege is not sufficient
to assign tags to saved objects. The user also needs to have `write` permission
on the objects he wants to assign tags to.
