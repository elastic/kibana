Tags enable you to categorize your saved objects. You can then easily filter for related objects based on shared tags.

To begin, open the main menu, click *Stack Management*, then click *Tags*.

=== Required permissions

Access to *Tags* requires the `Tag Management` {kib} privilege. To add the privilege, open the menu, 
click *Stack Management*, then click *Roles*.

In addition:

* The `read` privilege allows you to assign tags to the saved objects for which you have write permission.
* The `write` privilege enables you to create, edit, and delete tags.


NOTE: Having the `Tag Management` {kib} privilege is not required to
view tags assigned on objects the user has `read` access to, or to filter objects by tags
in {kib} applications or from the navigational search.
