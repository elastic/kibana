[[managing-fields]]
== Field management

Whenever possible,
{kib} uses the same field type for display as {es}.  However, a few field types
{es} supports are not available in {kib}. Use field formatters to customize how your
fields are displayed in Kibana, regardless of how they are stored in {es}.

Kibana provides these field formatters:

* <<field-formatters-string, Strings>>
* <<field-formatters-date, Dates>>
* <<field-formatters-geopoint, Geopoints>>
* <<field-formatters-numeric, Numbers>>

To format a field:

. Open the main menu, and click *Stack Management > Index Patterns*.
. Click the index pattern that contains the field you want to format.
. Find the field you want to format and click the edit icon (image:management/index-patterns/images/edit_icon.png[]).
. Select a format and fill in the details.

[[field-formatters-date]]

[[field-formatters-numeric]]
=== Numeric field formatters

Numeric fields support the `Url`, `Bytes`, `Duration`, `Number`, `Percentage`, `String`, and `Color` formatters.

The `Bytes`, `Number`, and `Percentage` formatters enable you to choose the display formats of numbers in this field using
the <<numeral, Elastic numeral pattern>> syntax that {kib} maintains.

[[scripted-fields]]
=== Scripted fields

Scripted fields compute data on the fly from the data in your {es} indices. The data is shown on
the Discover tab as part of the document data, and you can use scripted fields in your visualizations. You query scripted fields with the <<kuery-query, {kib} query language>>, and can filter them using the filter bar. The scripted field values are computed at query time, so they aren't indexed and cannot be searched using the {kib} default
query language.

WARNING: Computing data on the fly with scripted fields can be very resource intensive and can have a direct impact on
{kib} performance. Keep in mind that there's no built-in validation of a scripted field. If your scripts are
buggy, you'll get exceptions whenever you try to view the dynamically generated data.

When you define a scripted field in {kib}, you have a choice of the {ref}/modules-scripting-expression.html[Lucene expressions] or the 
{ref}/modules-scripting-painless.html[Painless] scripting language.

You can reference any single value numeric field in your expressions, for example:

----
doc['field_name'].value
----

For more information on scripted fields and additional examples, refer to
https://www.elastic.co/blog/using-painless-kibana-scripted-fields[Using Painless in {kib} scripted fields]
