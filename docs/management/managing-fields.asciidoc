== Managing Fields

The fields for the index pattern are listed in a table. Click a column header to sort the table by that column. Click
the *Controls* button in the rightmost column for a given field to edit the field's properties. You can manually set
the field's format from the *Format* drop-down. Format options vary based on the field's type.

You can also set the field's popularity value in the *Popularity* text entry box to any desired value. Click the
*Update Field* button to confirm your changes or *Cancel* to return to the list of fields.

Kibana has field formatters for the following field types:

* <<field-formatters-string, Strings>>
* <<field-formatters-date, Dates>>
* <<field-formatters-geopoint, Geopoints>>
* <<field-formatters-numeric, Numbers>>

[[field-formatters-string]]
=== String Field Formatters

String fields support the `String` and `Url` formatters.

include::field-formatters/url-formatter.asciidoc[]

[[field-formatters-date]]
=== Date Field Formatters

Date fields support the `Date`, `Url`, and `String` formatters.

The `Date` formatter enables you to choose the display format of date stamps using the https://momentjs.com/[moment.js]
standard format definitions.

[[field-formatters-geopoint]]
=== Geographic Point Field Formatters

Geographic point fields support the `String` formatter.

include::field-formatters/string-formatter.asciidoc[]

[[field-formatters-numeric]]
=== Numeric Field Formatters

Numeric fields support the `Url`, `Bytes`, `Duration`, `Number`, `Percentage`, `String`, and `Color` formatters.

include::field-formatters/url-formatter.asciidoc[]

include::field-formatters/string-formatter.asciidoc[]

include::field-formatters/duration-formatter.asciidoc[]

include::field-formatters/color-formatter.asciidoc[]

The `Bytes`, `Number`, and `Percentage` formatters enable you to choose the display formats of numbers in this field using
the https://adamwdraper.github.io/Numeral-js/[numeral.js] standard format definitions.

[[scripted-fields]]
=== Scripted Fields

Scripted fields compute data on the fly from the data in your Elasticsearch indices. Scripted field data is shown on
the Discover tab as part of the document data, and you can use scripted fields in your visualizations.
Scripted field values are computed at query time so they aren't indexed and cannot be searched using Kibana's default
query language. However they can be queried using Kibana's new <<kuery-query, experimental query language>>. Scripted
fields are also supported in the filter bar.

WARNING: Computing data on the fly with scripted fields can be very resource intensive and can have a direct impact on
Kibana's performance. Keep in mind that there's no built-in validation of a scripted field. If your scripts are
buggy, you'll get exceptions whenever you try to view the dynamically generated data.

When you define a scripted field in Kibana, you have a choice of scripting languages. Starting with 5.0, the default
options are {ref}/modules-scripting-expression.html[Lucene expressions] and {ref}/modules-scripting-painless.html[Painless].
While you can use other scripting languages if you enable dynamic scripting for them in Elasticsearch, this is not recommended
because they cannot be sufficiently {ref}/modules-scripting-security.html[sandboxed].

WARNING: Use of Groovy, JavaScript, and Python scripting is deprecated starting in Elasticsearch 5.0, and support for those
scripting languages will be removed in the future.

You can reference any single value numeric field in your expressions, for example:

----
doc['field_name'].value
----
