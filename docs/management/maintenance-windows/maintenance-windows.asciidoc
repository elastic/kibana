You can schedule single or recurring maintenance windows to temporarily reduce rule notifications.
For example, a maintenance window prevents false alarms during planned outages.

By default, a maintenance window affects all rules in all {kib} apps within its space.
You can refine the scope of a maintenance window by adding filters and rule categories.

Alerts continue to be generated, however notifications are suppressed as follows:

- When an alert occurs during a maintenance window, there are no notifications.
When the alert recovers, there are no notifications--even if the recovery occurs after the maintenance window ends.
- When an alert occurs before a maintenance window and recovers during or after the maintenance window, notifications are sent as usual.

== Create and manange maintenance windows

In *Management > {stack-manage-app} > Maintenance Windows*, you can create, edit, and archive maintenance windows.

When you create a maintenance window, you must provide a name and a schedule.
You can optionally configure it to repeat daily, monthly, yearly, or on a custom interval.

By default, maintenance windows affect all categories of rules.
The category-specific maintenance window options alter this behavior.
For the definitive list of rule types in each category, refer to the <<list-rule-types-api,get rule types API>>.

If you turn on *Filter alerts*, you can use KQL to filter the alerts affected by the maintenance window:

NOTE: You can select only a single category when you turn on filters.

A maintenance window can have any one of the following statuses:

- `Upcoming`: It will run at the scheduled date and time.
- `Running`: It is running.
- `Finished`: It ended and does not have a repeat schedule.
- `Archived`: It is archived. In a future release, archived maintenance windows will be queued for deletion.

When you <<rule-details,view alert details>> in {kib}, each alert shows unique identifiers for maintenance windows that affected it.
