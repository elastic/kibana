== Managing Indices

The *Index management* UI enables you to view index settings,
mappings, and statistics and perform management operations.
These include refreshing, flushing, clearing the cache, merging segments,
and closing or deleting indices. The UI provides a convenient way to
perform bulk operations on multiple indices.

Click the name of an index to display the index summary and access
the index settings, mapping, and statistics. The *Manage* menu in the
lower right of the index pane enables you to manage
the selected index.

To perform bulk operations, select the checkboxes of the indices you want to
modify and choose an operation from the *Manage indices* menu
next to the query bar. To select all
indices, select the checkbox in the *Name* header.

For information about the available management operations,
see {ref}/indices.html[Indices APIs] in the Elasticsearch Reference.
