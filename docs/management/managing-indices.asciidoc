The index management UI enables you to update your Elasticsearch indices
either individually or in bulk. To open the UI, go to *Management* and click
*Index Management*.

Clicking an index name opens a panel with access to the index settings, mapping, and
statistics. Operations for managing the index are in a context menu on the lower
right.

To perform operations on multiple indices, in the main window, select the
checkbox for each index, or *Name* to select all indices.  The context
menu for managing the indices appears next to the query bar.

For information on the items in the context menu, see {ref}/indices.html[Indices APIs]
in the Elasticsearch Reference.
