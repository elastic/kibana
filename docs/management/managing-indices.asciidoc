== Index management

*Index Management* enables you to view index settings,
mappings, and statistics and perform index-level operations.
These include refreshing, flushing, clearing the cache, force merging segments,
freezing indices, and more. Practicing good index management helps ensure 
that your data is stored in the most cost-effective way possible.

*Index Management* also enables you to create index templates. This reduces 
the amount of bookkeeping when working with indices. Instead of manually 
setting up your indices, you can create them automatically from a template, 
ensuring that your settings, mappings, and aliases are consistently defined.

To get started, go to *Management > {es} > Index Management*.

If security is enabled,
you must have the `monitor` cluster privilege and the `view_index_metadata` 
and `manage` index privileges to view the data.  
For index templates, you require the `manage_index_templates` cluster privilege.
See {xpack-ref}/security-privileges.html[Security Privileges] for more
information.

Before using this feature, you should be familiar with index management 
operations. Refer to the {ref}/indices.html[index management APIs]
and the {ref}/indices-templates.html[index template APIs].

=== View and edit indices

When you open *Index Management*, youâ€™re presented an overview of your configured indices. 
Badges indicate if an index is {ref}/frozen-indices.html[frozen], 
a {ref}/ccr-put-follow.html[follower index], 
or a {ref}/rollup-get-rollup-index-caps.html[rollup index]. 

Clicking a badge filters for all indices of that type. 
You can also narrow the view of your indices using the search bar.

You can drill down into each index to investigate the index 
{ref}/index-modules.html#index-modules-settings[settings], {ref}/mapping.html[mapping], and statistics.  
From this view, you can edit the index settings.

=== Perform index-level operations

Use the *Manage* menu to initiate index-level operations.  This menu 
is available in the index details view, or when you select the checkbox of one or more 
indices on the overview page. The menu includes the following actions:  

* *Close index*. Blocks the index from read/write operations. 
A closed index exists in the cluster, but doesn't consume resources 
other than disk space. If you reopen a closed index, it goes through the 
normal recovery process. 

* *Force merge index*. Reduces the number of segments in your shard by 
merging smaller files and clearing deleted ones. Only force merge a read-only index.

* *Refresh index*. Writes the operations in the indexing buffer to the 
filesystem cache. This action is automatically performed once per second. Forcing a manual 
refresh is useful during testing, but should not be routinely done in 
production because it has a performance impact.

* *Clear index cache*. Clears all caches associated with the index. 

* *Flush index*. Frees memory by syncing the filesystem cache to disk and 
clearing the cache. Once the sync is complete, the internal transaction log is reset.

* *Freeze index*. Makes the index read-only and reduces its memory footprint 
by moving shards to disk. {ref}/frozen-indices.html[Frozen indices] remain 
searchable, but queries take longer.

* *Delete index*. Permanently removes the index and all of its documents.

* *Add lifecycle policy*.  Specifies a policy for managing the lifecycle of the 
index.

=== Manage index templates

An index template defines {ref}/index-modules.html#index-modules-settings[settings],
{ref}/mapping.html[mappings], and {ref}/indices-add-alias.html[aliases] 
that you can automatically apply when creating a new index.  {es} applies a 
template to a new index based on an index pattern that matches the index name.

The *Index Templates* view lists your templates and enables you to examine, edit, clone, and 
delete them. Changes you make to an index template 
do not affect existing indices.

If you don't have any templates, you can create one using the *Create template* wizard.  
Index templates are applied during index creation, 
so you must create the 
template before you create the indices.
