== Index Management

*Index Management* features are an easy, convenient way to manage your
{es} cluster's indices, data streams, and index templates. Practicing good index
management ensures your data is stored correctly and in the most cost-effective
way possible.

[float]
=== What you'll learn

This page shows you how to use *Index Management* features to:

To manage your indices, open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Index Management*.

image::images/management_index_labels.png[Index Management UI]

[float]
=== Before you start

Before using this feature, you should be familiar with index management
operations. Refer to the {ref}/indices.html[index management APIs], the
{ref}/indices-templates.html[index template APIs], and the
{ref}/data-streams.html[data streams documentation].

[float]
=== Required permissions

The minimum required permissions to access *Index Management* are
the `monitor` cluster privilege and the `view_index_metadata`
and `manage` index privileges to view the data.
For index templates, you must have the `manage_index_templates` cluster privilege.
See {ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges] for more
information.

You can add these privileges in *Stack Management > Security > Roles*.

[float]
=== View and edit indices

When you open *Index Management*, you’re presented an overview of your configured indices.
Badges indicate if an index is {ref}/frozen-indices.html[frozen],
a {ref}/ccr-put-follow.html[follower index],
or a {ref}/rollup-get-rollup-index-caps.html[rollup index].

Clicking a badge narrows the list to only indices of that type.
You can also filter your indices using the search bar.

You can drill down into each index to investigate the index
{ref}/index-modules.html#index-modules-settings[settings], {ref}/mapping.html[mapping], and statistics.
From this view, you can also edit the index settings.

[float]
=== Perform index-level operations

Use the *Manage* menu to perform index-level operations. This menu
is available in the index details view, or when you select the checkbox of one or more
indices on the overview page. The menu includes the following actions:

* *Close index*. Blocks the index from read/write operations.
A closed index exists in the cluster, but doesn't consume resources
other than disk space. If you reopen a closed index, it goes through the
normal recovery process.

* *Force merge index*. Reduces the number of segments in your shard by
merging smaller files and clearing deleted ones. Only force merge a read-only index.

* *Refresh index*. Writes the operations in the indexing buffer to the
filesystem cache. This action is automatically performed once per second. Forcing a manual
refresh is useful during testing, but should not be routinely done in
production because it has a performance impact.

* *Clear index cache*. Clears all caches associated with the index.

* *Flush index*. Frees memory by syncing the filesystem cache to disk and
clearing the cache. Once the sync is complete, the internal transaction log is reset.

* *Freeze index*. Makes the index read-only and reduces its memory footprint
by moving shards to disk. Frozen indices remain
searchable, but queries take longer.

* *Delete index*. Permanently removes the index and all of its documents.

* *Add lifecycle policy*. Specifies a policy for managing the lifecycle of the
index.

[[manage-data-streams]]
=== Manage data streams

A {ref}/data-streams.html[data stream] lets you store time series data across
multiple backing indices while giving you a single named resource to use in
requests. The *Data Streams* view lists your data streams and lets you examine
or delete them.

To view more information about a data stream, such as its generation or its
current index lifecycle policy, click the stream's name.

To view information about the stream's backing indices, click the number in the
*Indices* column.

[float]
[[manage-index-templates]]
=== Manage index templates

An index template defines {ref}/index-modules.html#index-modules-settings[settings],
{ref}/mapping.html[mappings], and {ref}/indices-add-alias.html[aliases]
that you can automatically apply when creating a new index. {es} applies a
template to a new index based on an index pattern that matches the index name.

The *Index Templates* view lists your templates and enables you to examine, edit, clone, and
delete them. Changes you make to an index template
do not affect existing indices.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/management-index-templates.png[Index templates]

If you don't have any templates, you can create one using the *Create template* wizard.
Index templates are applied during index creation,
so you must create the
template before you create the indices.

[float]
==== Try it: Create an index template

In this tutorial, you’ll create an index template for randomly generated log
files. You'll then use the template to configure two new indices.

*Step 1. Add a name and index pattern*

. In the *Index Templates* view, open the *Create template* wizard.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/management_index_create_wizard.png[Create wizard]

. In the *Name* field, enter `my-index-template`.

. Set *Index pattern* to `my-index-*` so the template matches any index
with that index pattern.

. Leave *Data Stream*, *Priority*, *Version*, and *_meta field* as-is or blank.

. Click *Next*.

*Step 2. Add settings, mappings, and index aliases*

. Add component templates to your index template.
+
{ref}/indices-component-template.html[Component templates] are pre-configured
sets of mappings, index settings, and index aliases you can reuse across
multiple index templates. Badges indicate whether a component template contains
mappings (*M*), index settings (*S*), index aliases (*A*), or a combination of
the three.
+
Component templates are optional. For this tutorial, do not add any component
templates.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/management_index_component_template.png[Component templates page]

. Define index settings. These are optional. For this tutorial, leave this
section blank.

. Define a mapping that contains an object field named `geo` with a child
geo-point field named `coordinates`:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/management-index-templates-mappings.png[Mapped fields page]
+
Alternatively, you can click the *Load JSON* link and define the mapping as JSON:
+
[source,js]
----
{
  "properties": {
    "geo": {
      "properties": {
        "coordinates": {
          "type": "geo_point"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
+
You can create additional mapping configurations in the *Dynamic templates* and
*Advanced options* tabs. No additional mappings are required for this tutorial.

. Define an index alias named `my-index`:
+
[source,js]
----
{
  "my-index": {}
}
----

. On the review page, check the summary. If everything looks right, click
*Create template*.

*Step 3. Create new indices*

You’re now ready to load the logs data and create new indices using your index
template.

. In the {kib} *Console*, index the following documents:
+
[source,js]
----
POST /my-index-000001/_doc
{
  "@timestamp": "2019-05-18T15:57:27.541Z",
  "ip": "225.44.217.191",
  "extension": "jpg",
  "response": "200",
  "geo": {
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": 38.53146222,
      "lon": -121.7864906
    }
  },
  "url": "https://media-for-the-masses.theacademyofperformingartsandscience.org/uploads/charles-fullerton.jpg"
}

POST /my-index-000002/_doc
{
  "@timestamp": "2019-05-20T03:44:20.844Z",
  "ip": "198.247.165.49",
  "extension": "php",
  "response": "200",
  "geo": {
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": 37.13189556,
      "lon": -76.4929875
    }
  },
  "memory": 241720,
  "url": "https://theacademyofperformingartsandscience.org/people/type:astronauts/name:laurel-b-clark/profile"
}
----
+
These requests create two indices: `my-index-000001` and `my-index-000002`.

. Use the {es} {ref}/indices-get-index.html#indices-get-index[get index API] to
view one of the newly created indices. The index's mappings and alias are
configured automatically based on the template.
