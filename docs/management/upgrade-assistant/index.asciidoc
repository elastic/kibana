== Upgrade Assistant

The Upgrade Assistant helps you prepare for your upgrade to {es} 9.0. 
To access the assistant, go to *Management > 9.0 Upgrade Assistant*. 

The assistant identifies the deprecated settings in your cluster and indices 
and guides you through the process of resolving issues, including reindexing. 

Before upgrading to Elasticsearch 9.0, make sure that you are using the final 
8.x minor release to see the most up-to-date deprecation issues.

=== Reindexing

The *Indices* page lists the indices that are incompatible with the next 
major version of {es}. You can initiate a reindex to resolve the issues.

For a preview of how the data will change during the reindex, select the 
index name. A warning appears if the index requires destructive changes.  
Back up your index, then proceed with the reindex by accepting each breaking change.  

You can follow the progress as the Upgrade Assistant makes the index read-only, 
creates a new index, reindexes the documents, and creates an alias that points 
from the old index to the new one. 

If the reindexing fails or is cancelled, the changes are rolled back, the 
new index is deleted, and the original index becomes writable. An error 
message explains the reason for the failure.

You can reindex multiple indices at a time, but keep an eye on the 
{es} metrics, including CPU usage, memory pressure, and disk usage. If a 
metric is so high it affects query performance, cancel the reindex and 
continue by reindexing fewer indices at a time.

Additional considerations:

* During a reindex of a Watcher (`.watches`) index, the Watcher process 
pauses and no alerts are triggered.  

* During a reindex of a Machine Learning (`.ml-state`) index, the Machine 
Learning job pauses and models are not trained or updated.
