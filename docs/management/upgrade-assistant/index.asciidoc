== Upgrade Assistant

The Upgrade Assistant helps you prepare for your upgrade from {es} 6.x to {es} 7.0. 
To access the assistant, go to *Management > 7.0 Upgrade Assistant*. 

The assistant identifies the deprecated settings in your cluster and indices 
and guides you through the process of resolving issues, including reindexing. 

Before upgrading to {es} 7.0, make sure that you are using the final 6.x minor 
release to see the most up-to-date deprecation issues.
