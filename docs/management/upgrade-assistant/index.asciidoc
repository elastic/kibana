== Upgrade Assistant

The Upgrade Assistant helps you prepare for your upgrade 
to the next major version of the Elastic Stack.
To access the assistant, open the main menu and go to *Stack Management > Upgrade Assistant*.

The assistant identifies deprecated settings in your configuration,
enables you to see if you are using deprecated features,
and guides you through the process of resolving issues.

If you have indices that were created prior to 7.0,
you can use the assistant to reindex them so they can be accessed from 8.0. 

IMPORTANT: To see the most up-to-date deprecation information before 
upgrading to 8.0, upgrade to the latest 7.n release.
