== Upgrade Assistant

The Upgrade Assistant helps you prepare for your upgrade to the next major {es} version.
For example, if you are using 6.8, the Upgrade Assistant helps you to upgrade to 7.0.
To access the assistant, open the menu, then go to *Stack Management > {es} > Upgrade Assistant*.

The assistant identifies the deprecated settings in your cluster and indices
and guides you through the process of resolving issues, including reindexing.

Before you upgrade, make sure that you are using the latest released minor
version of {es} to see the most up-to-date deprecation issues.
For example, if you want to upgrade to to 7.0, make sure that you are using 6.8.

=== Reindexing

The *Indices* page lists the indices that are incompatible with the next
major version of {es}. You can initiate a reindex to resolve the issues.

For a preview of how the data will change during the reindex, select the
index name. A warning appears if the index requires destructive changes.
Back up your index, then proceed with the reindex by accepting each breaking change.

You can follow the progress as the Upgrade Assistant makes the index read-only,
creates a new index, reindexes the documents, and creates an alias that points
from the old index to the new one.

If the reindexing fails or is cancelled, the changes are rolled back,
the new index is deleted, and the original index becomes writable. An error
message explains the reason for the failure.

You can reindex multiple indices at a time, but keep an eye on the
{es} metrics, including CPU usage, memory pressure, and disk usage. If a metric
is so high it affects query performance, cancel the reindex and continue
by reindexing fewer indices at a time.

Additional considerations:

* If you use {alert-features}, when you reindex the internal indices
(`.watches`), the {watcher} process pauses and no alerts are triggered.

* If you use {ml-features}, when you reindex the internal indices (`.ml-state`),
the {ml} jobs pause and models are not trained or updated.

* If you use {security-features}, before you reindex the internal indices
(`.security*`), it is a good idea to create a temporary superuser account in the
`file` realm. For more information, see
{ref}/configuring-file-realm.html[Configuring a file realm].
