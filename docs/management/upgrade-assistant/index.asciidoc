== Upgrade Assistant

The Upgrade Assistant helps you prepare for your upgrade to {es} 8.0. 
To access the assistant, go to *Management > 8.0 Upgrade Assistant*. 

The assistant identifies the deprecated settings in your cluster and indices 
and guides you through the process of resolving issues, including reindexing. 

Before upgrading to Elasticsearch 8.0, make sure that you are using the final 
7.x minor release to see the most up-to-date deprecation issues.
