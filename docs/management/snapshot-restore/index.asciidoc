== Snapshot and Restore

*Snapshot and Restore* enables you to backup your {es} 
indices and clusters using data and state snapshots. 
Snapshots are important because they provide a copy of your data in case 
something goes wrong. If you need to roll back to an older version of your data,
you can restore a snapshot from the repository.

You’ll find *Snapshot and Restore* under *Management > Elasticsearch*. 
With this UI, you can:

* View a list of your snapshots and drill down into details
* Register a repository for storing your snapshots
* Restore data into your cluster from a snapshot
* Delete a snapshot to free storage space

Before using this feature, you should be familiar with how snapshots work.  
{ref}/modules-snapshots.html[Snapshot and Restore] is a good source for 
more detailed information.

=== Register a repository

The *Repositories* view provides an overview of your repositories.  You can 
drill down into each repository for further investigation.

If you don't have a repository, you're prompted to register one. The 
*Register repository* wizard supports three repository types
out of the box: shared file system, read-only URL, and source-only.  
For details about these repositories and their settings, 
see {ref}/modules-snapshots.html#_repositories[Repositories]. For an example, 
see <<snapshot-repositories-example, registering a shared file system repository>>.

To use other repositories, such as S3, you can install plugins. See  
{ref}/modules-snapshots.html#_repository_plugins[Repository plugins].

[float]
=== View your snapshots

The *Snapshots* view gives an overview of your snapshots. You can drill down 
into each snapshot for further investigation.

To create snapshots, use the Kibana <<console-kibana, Console>>. The 
{ref}//modules-snapshots.html#_snapshot[snapshot API]
takes the current state and data in your index or cluster, and then saves it to a 
shared repository. 

The snapshot process is "smart." Your first snapshot is a complete copy of 
the data in your index or cluster.
All subsequent snapshots save the changes between the existing snapshots and 
the new data.

[float]
=== Restore a snapshot

The *Restore* wizard walks you through the process of restoring a snapshot 
into a running cluster. To get started, go to the *Snapshots* view, find the 
snapshot, and click the restore icon in the *Actions* column. You’re presented 
options for defining the restore, including which 
indices to restore and whether to modify the index settings.

To track the progress of a restore, use the *Restore Status* view. You’ll 
see the current state for each shard in the snapshot.

[float]
=== Delete a snapshot

Delete snapshots to manage your repository storage space.
Find the snapshot in the *Snapshots* view and click the trash icon in the 
*Actions* column. To delete snapshots in bulk, select their checkboxes, 
and then click *Delete snapshots*.

=== Example: Register a shared file system repository

This example shows how to register a shared file system repository 
and store snapshots.

[float]
==== Register the repository location

You must register the location of the repository in the `path.repo` setting on 
your master and data nodes.  You can do this in one of two ways:

* Edit  your `elasticsearch.yml` to include the `path.repo` setting.

* Pass the `path.repo` setting when you start Elasticsearch.
+
`bin/elasticsearch -E path.repo=/tmp/es-backups`

[float]
==== Register the repository

Use *Snapshot and Restore* to register the repository where your snapshots 
will live. 

. Go to *Management > Elasticsearch > Snapshot and Restore*.
. Open the *Repositories* view.
. Click *Register a repository*.
. Enter a name for your repository. For example, `my_backup`.
. Set *Repository type* to Shared file system.
+ 
[role="screenshot"]
image:management/snapshot-restore/images/register_repo.png["Register repository"]

. Click *Next*.
. In *Location*, enter the path to the snapshot repository, `/tmp/es-backups`.
. In *Chunk size*, enter 100mb so that snapshot files are not bigger than that size.
. Use the defaults for all other fields.
. Click *Register*.
+
Your new repository is listed on the *Repositories* tab.
+
. Click the respository and inspect its details. 
+
The repository currently doesn’t have any snapshots.


[float]
==== Add a snapshot to the repository
Use the {ref}//modules-snapshots.html#_snapshot[snapshot API] to create a snapshot.

. Go to *Dev Tools > Console*.
. Create the snapshot. 
+
In this example, the snapshot name is `2019-04-25_snapshot`. You can also 
use {ref}//date-math-index-names.html[date math expression] for the snapshot name.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:management/snapshot-restore/images/create_snapshot.png["Create snapshot"]
+
. Open *Snapshot and Restore*. 
+
Your new snapshot is available in the *Snapshots* view.
