== Snapshot and Restore

*Snapshot and Restore* enables you to backup your {es} 
indices and clusters using data and state snapshots. 
Snapshots are important because they provide a copy of your data in case 
something goes wrong. If you need to roll back to an older version of your data,
you can restore a snapshot from the repository.

You’ll find *Snapshot and Restore* under *Management > Elasticsearch*. 
With this UI, you can:

* <<kib-snapshot-register-repository, Register a repository for storing your snapshots>>
* <<kib-view-snapshot, View a list of your snapshots and drill down into details>>
* <<kib-restore-snapshot, Restore data into your cluster from a snapshot>>
* <<kib-snapshot-policy, Create a policy for automatic snapshots>>
* <<kib-delete-snapshot, Delete a snapshot to free storage space>>

Before using this feature, you should be familiar with how snapshots work.  
{ref}/modules-snapshots.html[Snapshot and Restore] is a good source for 
more detailed information.

[[kib-snapshot-register-repository]]
=== Register a repository

The *Repositories* view provides an overview of your repositories. 
Click a repository name to view its type, number of snapshots, and settings, and also to verify status.

[role="screenshot"]
image:management/snapshot-restore/images/repository_list.png["Repository list"]

If you don't have a repository, you're prompted to register one. 
{es} supports three repository types
out of the box: shared file system, read-only URL, and source-only.  
For more information on these repositories and their settings, 
see {ref}/modules-snapshots.html#snapshots-repositories[Repositories]. For an example, 
see <<snapshot-repositories-example, registering a shared file system repository>>.

To use other repositories, such as S3, you can install plugins. See  
{ref}/modules-snapshots.html#_repository_plugins[Repository plugins].

[float]
[[kib-view-snapshot]]
=== View your snapshots

The *Snapshots* view gives an overview of your snapshots. You can drill down 
into each snapshot for further investigation.

[role="screenshot"]
image:management/snapshot-restore/images/snapshot_details.png["Snapshot details"]

If you don’t have any snapshots, you can create them from the {kib} <<console-kibana, Console>>. The 
{ref}//modules-snapshots.html#snapshots-take-snapshot[snapshot API]
takes the current state and data in your index or cluster, and then saves it to a 
shared repository. 

The snapshot process is "smart." Your first snapshot is a complete copy of 
the data in your index or cluster.
All subsequent snapshots save the changes between the existing snapshots and 
the new data.

[float]
[[kib-restore-snapshot]]
=== Restore a snapshot

The *Restore* wizard walks you through the process of restoring a snapshot 
into a running cluster. To get started, go to the *Snapshots* view, find the 
snapshot, and click the restore icon in the *Actions* column. 

You’re presented 
options for the restore, including which 
indices to restore and whether to modify the index settings.
You can restore an existing index only if it’s closed and has the same 
number of shards as the index in the snapshot.

Once you initiate the restore, you're navigated to the *Restore Status* view,
where you can track the progress.

[float]
[[kib-snapshot-policy]]
=== Create a snapshot lifecycle policy

You can create policies to schedule automatic snapshots of your cluster. 
{ref}/snapshot-lifecycle-management-api.html[Snapshot lifecycle policies] are related 
to {ref}/index-lifecycle-management.html[index lifecycle policies]. 
However, where an index lifecycle policy applies to a single index, 
a snapshot lifecycle policy can span multiple indices.

For an overview of your policies, open the *Policies* view.
You can drill down into each policy to examine its settings and last successful and failed run. 

If you don’t have any policies, use the *Create policy* wizard.
You’ll define the snapshots and repository, when to take snapshots, and
the settings, such as which indices the snapshot should contain.

[role="screenshot"]
image:management/snapshot-restore/images/create-policy.png["Snapshot details"]

You can perform the following actions on a policy:

* *Run* a policy immediately without waiting for the scheduled time.
This action is useful before an upgrade or before performing maintenance on indices.
* *Edit* a policy and immediately apply changes to the schedule.
* *Delete* a policy to prevent any future snapshots from being taken.
This action does not cancel any currently ongoing snapshots or remove any previously taken snapshots.

[float]
[[kib-delete-snapshot]]
=== Delete a snapshot

Delete snapshots to manage your repository storage space.
Find the snapshot in the *Snapshots* view and click the trash icon in the 
*Actions* column. To delete snapshots in bulk, select their checkboxes, 
and then click *Delete snapshots*.

=== Example: Register a shared file system repository

This example shows how to register a shared file system repository 
and store snapshots.

[float]
==== Register the repository location

You must register the location of the repository in the `path.repo` setting on 
your master and data nodes.  You can do this in one of two ways:

* Edit  your `elasticsearch.yml` to include the `path.repo` setting.

* Pass the `path.repo` setting when you start Elasticsearch.
+
`bin/elasticsearch -E path.repo=/tmp/es-backups`

[float]
==== Register the repository

Use *Snapshot and Restore* to register the repository where your snapshots 
will live. 

. Go to *Management > Elasticsearch > Snapshot and Restore*.
. Open the *Repositories* view.
. Click *Register a repository*.
. Enter a name for your repository, for example, `my_backup`.
. Set *Repository type* to Shared file system.
+ 
[role="screenshot"]
image:management/snapshot-restore/images/register_repo.png["Register repository"]

. Click *Next*.
. In *Location*, enter the path to the snapshot repository, `/tmp/es-backups`.
. In *Chunk size*, enter 100mb so that snapshot files are not bigger than that size.
. Use the defaults for all other fields.
. Click *Register*.
+
Your new repository is listed on the *Repositories* view.
+
. Click the respository and inspect its details. 
+
The repository currently doesn’t have any snapshots.


[float]
==== Add a snapshot to the repository
Use the {ref}//modules-snapshots.html#snapshots-take-snapshot[snapshot API] to create a snapshot.

. Go to *Dev Tools > Console*.
. Create the snapshot. 
+
In this example, the snapshot name is `2019-04-25_snapshot`. You can also 
use {ref}//date-math-index-names.html[date math expression] for the snapshot name.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:management/snapshot-restore/images/create_snapshot.png["Create snapshot"]
+
. Open *Snapshot and Restore*. 
+
Your new snapshot is available in the *Snapshots* view.
