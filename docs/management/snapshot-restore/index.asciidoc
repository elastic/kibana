== Snapshot repositories

Use *Snapshot Repositories* to store backups of your 
{es} indices and clusters. Snapshots are important because they provide 
a copy of your data in case something goes wrong. If you need to roll 
back to an older version of your data, you can restore a snapshot from the repository.

Before using this feature, you should be familiar with how snapshots work.  
{ref}/modules-snapshots.html[Snapshot and Restore] is a good source for 
more detailed information.

To get started, go to *Management > Elasticsearch > Snapshot Repositories*.  You 
begin with an overview of your repositories. You can then use the UI to 
drill down into your repositories and snapshots.

=== Registering a repository

You must have a registry before you can save your snapshots. If you don’t see a 
repository in the list, navigate to *Register repository* to create one.

{kib} supports three types of repositories on startup:

* *Shared file system.*  Uses a shared file system to store the snapshots.
* *Read-only url.*  Provides a read-only alternative to access snapshot data 
in another repository. 
* *Source-only.*  Enables storage of minimal, source-only snapshots.  
A source-only repository can take up to 50% less disk space.

For more information on these repositories and the settings that you can 
configure, see {ref}/modules-snapshots.html#_repositories[Repositories]. 
To add support for additional types, see 
{ref}/modules-snapshots.html#_repository_plugins[Repository plugins].

A best practice is to register a repository for each major version of 
{es}. If you register the same snapshot repository with multiple clusters, 
give only one cluster write access to the repository. All other clusters 
connected to that repository should have read-only access.

=== Creating a snapshot

Use the Kibana <<console-kibana, Console>> to create your snapshots. The 
{ref}//modules-snapshots.html#_snapshot[snapshot API]
takes the current state and data in your index or cluster and saves it to a 
shared repository. 

The snapshot process is "smart." Your first snapshot is a complete copy of data.
All subsequent snapshots save the changes between the existing snapshots and 
the new data.

For an overview of the snapshots in your cluster, go to the *Snapshots* tab in *Snapshot Repositories*.
You can then drill down into the details for each snapshot.

=== Example: Register a shared file system repository

This example shows how to register a shared file system repository 
and store snapshots.

[float]
==== Register the repository location

You must register the location of the repository in the `path.repo` setting on 
your master and data nodes.  You can do this in one of two ways:

* Edit  your `elasticsearch.yml` to include the `path.repo` setting.

* Pass the `path.repo` setting when you start Elasticsearch.
+
`bin/elasticsearch -E path.repo=/tmp/es-backups`

[float]
==== Register the repository

Use *Snapshot Repositories* to register a repository. 


. Go to *Management > Elasticsearch > Snapshot Repositories*.
. Click *Register a repository*.
. Enter a name for your repository. For example, `my_backup`.
. Set *Repository type* to Shared file system.
+

. Click *Next*.
. In *Location*, enter the path to the snapshot repository, `/tmp/es-backups`.
. In *Chunk size*, enter 100mb so that snapshot files are not bigger than that size.
. Use the defaults for all other fields.
. Click *Register*.
+
Your new repository is listed on the *Repositories* tab.
+
. Inspect the details for the repository. 
+
The repository currently doesn’t have any snapshots.
+
. Click *Verify repository* to view the repository connection status. 
+

[float]
==== Add a snapshot to the repository
Use the {ref}//modules-snapshots.html#_snapshot[snapshot API] to create a snapshot.

. Go to *Dev Tools > Console*.
. Create the snapshot. 
+
In this example, the snapshot name is `2019-04-25_snapshot`. You can also 
use {ref}//date-math-index-names.html[date math expression] for the snapshot name.
+

+
. Open *Snapshot Repositories*. 
+
Your new snapshot is available in the *Snapshots* tab.
