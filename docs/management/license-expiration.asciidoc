[[license-expiration]]
=== License expiration

Your license is time based and expires at a future date. If you're using
{monitor-features} and your license will expire within 30 days, a license
expiration warning is displayed prominently. Warnings are also displayed on
startup and written to the {es} log starting 30 days from the expiration date.
These error messages tell you when the license expires and what features will be
disabled if you do not update the license.

IMPORTANT: You should update your license as soon as possible. You are
essentially flying blind when running with an expired license. Access to the
cluster health and stats APIs is critical for monitoring and managing an {es}
cluster.
