TIP: In the `Description` area, you can use
https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet[Markdown] syntax to create formatted
text.

the necessary <<setup-cases,prerequisites>>.

=== Add a visualization

After you create a case, you can optionally add a visualization. For

To add a visualization to a comment within your case:

. Click the *Visualization* button. The *Add visualization* dialog appears.

. Select an existing visualization from your Visualize Library or create a new
visualization.
+
IMPORTANT: Set an absolute time range for your visualization. This ensures your
visualization doesn't change over time after you save it to your case and
provides important context for viewers.

. After you've finished creating your visualization, click *Save and return* to
go back to your case.

. Click *Preview* to see how the visualization will appear in the case comment.

. Click *Add Comment* to add the visualization to your case.

After a visualization has been added to a case, you can modify or interact with
it by clicking the *Open Visualization* option in the comment menu.
