[[add-case-notifications]]
=== Add email notifications

You can configure email notifications that occur when users are assigned to
cases.

For hosted {kib} on {ess}:

. Add the email domains to the {cloud}/ec-organizations-notifications-domain-allowlist.html[notifications domain allowlist].
+
--
You do not need to take any more steps to configure an email connector or update
{kib} user settings, since the preconfigured Elastic-Cloud-SMTP connector is
used by default.
--

For self-managed {kib}:

. Create a preconfigured email connector.
+
--
NOTE: At this time, email notifications support only preconfigured connectors,
which are defined in the `kibana.yml` file.
For examples, refer to <<preconfigured-email-configuration>> and <<configuring-email>>.
--
. Set the `notifications.connectors.default.email` {kib} setting to the name of
your email connector.
. If you want the email notifications to contain links back to the case, you
must configure the <<server-publicBaseUrl,server.publicBaseUrl>> setting.

When you subsequently add assignees to cases, they receive an email.

[[add-case-files]]

To view images, click their name in the activity or file list.

[NOTE]
============================================================================

To add a visualization to a comment within your case:

. Click the *Visualization* button. The *Add visualization* dialog appears.

go back to your case.

. Click *Preview* to see how the visualization will appear in the case comment.

After a visualization has been added to a case, you can modify or interact with it by clicking the *Open Visualization* option in the case's comment menu.
