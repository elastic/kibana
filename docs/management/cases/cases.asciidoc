Cases are used to open and track issues directly in {kib}. All cases list
the original reporter and all the users who contribute to a case (_participants_).
You can also send cases to external incident management systems by configuring
connectors.

NOTE: If you create cases in the {observability} or {security-app}, they are not
visible in *{stack-manage-app}*. Likewise, the cases you create in
*{stack-manage-app}* are not visible in the {observability} or {security-app}.
You also cannot attach alerts from the {observability} or {security-app} to
cases in *{stack-manage-app}*.
