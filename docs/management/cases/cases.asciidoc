Cases are used to open and track issues directly in {kib}. You can add
assignees and tags to your cases, set their severity and status, and add alerts,
comments, and visualizations. You can also send cases to external incident
management systems by configuring connectors.

NOTE: If you create cases in the {observability} or {security-app}, they are not
visible in *{stack-manage-app}*. Likewise, the cases you create in
*{stack-manage-app}* are not visible in the {observability} or {security-app}.
You also cannot attach alerts from the {observability} or {security-app} to
cases in *{stack-manage-app}*.
