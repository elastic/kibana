Cases are used to open and track issues directly in {kib}.
You can add assignees and tags to your cases, set their severity and status, and add alerts, comments, and visualizations.
You can create cases automatically when alerts occur or send cases to external incident management systems by configuring connectors.

You can also optionally add custom fields and case templates. preview:[]

[[kibana-case-limitations]]
=== Limitations

* If you create cases in {stack-manage-app}, they are not visible from {observability} or the {security-app}. Likewise, the cases you create in {observability}, they are not visible in {stack-manage-app} or {elastic-sec}. 
* You cannot attach alerts from {observability} or {elastic-sec} to cases in {stack-manage-app}.
