=== Advanced Configuration for Dashboard Only Mode

If {security} is enabled, Kibana has a built-in `kibana_dashboard_only_user` 
role that grants read-only access to {kib}. This role is sufficient
for most use cases.  However, if your setup requires a custom {kib} index, you can create
your own roles and tag them as *Dashboard only mode*.

Go to *Management > Kibana > Advanced Settings* and search for *Dashboard*. By default 
`xpackDashboardMode:roles` is set to `kibana_dashboard_only_user`. 
Here you can add as many roles as you like.

By default, a *dashboard only mode* user doesn't have access to any data indices.
To grant read-only access to your custom {kib} instance,
you must assign the read <<kibana-privileges, Kibana privilege>>.
These privileges are available under *Management > Security > Roles*.

For more information on roles and privileges, see {xpack-ref}/authorization.html[User Authorization].
