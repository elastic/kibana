=== Advanced Configuration for Dashboard Only Mode

Kibana comes preconfigured with a reserved role called `kibana_dashboard_only_user` 
that grants read only access to the `.kibana` index. This role is sufficient
for most use cases.  However, if your setup requires a custom {kib} index, you can create
your own roles and tag them as *Dashboard only mode*.

Go to *Management > Kibana > Advanced Settings* and search for *Dashboard*. By default 
`xpackDashboardMode:roles` is set to `kibana_dashboard_only_user`. 
Here you can add as many roles as you like.

It's not necessary for *Dashboard only mode* to have additional privileges, 
but it's a convenient place to add access rules to a custom {kib} index.
To grant read only access to your custom {kib}
index, you must assign `view_index_metadata` and `read` privileges.
These privileges are available under *Management > Security > Roles*.
