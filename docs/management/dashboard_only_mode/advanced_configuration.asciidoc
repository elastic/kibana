=== Advanced configuration for Dashboard Only mode

Kibana comes preconfigured with a reserved role called `kibana_dashboard_only_user` which will be sufficient
for most use cases.  However, if your setup requires a custom Kibana index, you can manually create
Dashboard Mode roles.

To do so, go into *Management > Advanced Settings* and search for `xpackDashboardMode:roles`. Then assign whatever
role names you wish to use to flag a user for Dashboard Only mode.

It isn't necessary for Dashboard Only mode roles to have any additional permissions, but it's a convenient location
to also place access rules to the custom Kibana index. If you wish to grant read only access to your custom Kibana
index, it must have `view_index_metadata` permissions as well as `read` permissions.  These role settings are available
under *Management > Security > Roles*.
