== Dashboard-only mode

deprecated[7.4.0, Using the `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role is deprecated. Use <<kibana-feature-privileges,feature privileges>> instead.]

In dashboard-only mode, users have access to only the *Dashboard* app. 
Users can view and filter the dashboards, but cannot create, edit, or delete
them. This enables you to:

* Show off your dashboards without giving users access to all of {kib}

* Share your {kib} dashboards without the risk of users accidentally 
editing or deleting them

Dashboard-only mode pairs well with fullscreen mode.
You can share your dashboard with the team responsible 
for showing the dashboard on a big-screen monitor, and not worry about it being modified.

=== Assign dashboard-only mode
With {security} enabled, you can restrict users to dashboard-only mode by assigning 
them the built-in `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role. 

. Go to *Management > Security > Users*.
. Create or edit a user.
. Assign the `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role and a role that <<grant-read-access-to-indices, grants `read` access to the data indices>>.
+
For example, 
to enable users to view the dashboards in the sample data sets, you must assign them 
the `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role and a role that has 
`read` access to the kibana_* indices.

[IMPORTANT]
===========================================
* If you assign users the `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role and a role 
with write permissions to {kib}, they *will* have write access, 
even though the controls remain hidden in {kib}.

* If you also assign users the reserved `superuser` role, they will have full
access to {kib}.

===========================================

[[grant-read-access-to-indices]]
=== Grant read access to indices

The `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role  
does not provide access to data indices.
You must also assign the user a role that grants `read` access
to each index you are using. Use *Management > Security > Roles* to create or edit a 
role and assign index privileges.
For information on roles and privileges, see {stack-ov}/authorization.html[User authorization].

=== Advanced settings for dashboard only mode

The `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role grants access to all spaces. 
If your setup requires access to a 
subset of spaces, you can create a custom role, and then tag it as Dashboard only mode.

. Go to *Management > Advanced Settings*, and search for `xpackDashboardMode:roles`. 
+
By 
default, this is set to 
`kibana_dashboard_only_user`. 

. Add as many roles as you require.
