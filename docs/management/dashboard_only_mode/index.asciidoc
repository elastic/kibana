== Kibana Dashboard Only Mode

If {security} is enabled, you can use the `kibana_dashboard_only_user` built-in role to limit 
what users see when they log in to {kib}. The `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role is 
preconfigured with read-only permissions to {kib}.

IMPORTANT: You must also assign roles that grant the user appropriate access to the data indices.
For information on roles and privileges, see {xpack-ref}/authorization.html[User Authorization].

Users assigned this role are only able to see the Dashboard app in the navigation
pane. When users open a dashboard, they will have a limited visual experience. 
All edit and create controls are hidden.

To assign this role, go to *Management > Security > Users*, add or edit 
a user, and add the `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role.

IMPORTANT: If you assign users the `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role, along with a role 
with write permissions to {kib}, they *will* have write access, 
even though the controls remain hidden in the {kib} UI.

IMPORTANT: If you also assign users the reserved `superuser` role, they will be able to see 
all of {kib} and have full access.

<<advanced-dashboard-mode-configuration, Advanced configurations>> that use a 
custom {kib} index are possible.
