== Kibana Dashboard Only Mode

{xpack} gives the ability for admins to limit what certain users see when they log in to Kibana with a
reserved `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role.

When you assign a user this role, the next time they sign in to Kibana they will only be able to see the Dashboard app,
and no editing tools will be available.

IMPORTANT: If a user is also assigned the reserved `superuser` role, they will be able to see all of Kibana and have
full access.

The `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role comes preconfigured with read only permissions on the `.kibana` index.

IMPORTANT: If you assign a user the `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role, along with a role with write permissions on
the .kibana index, they *will* have write access, even though the controls will remain hidden in the kibana
UI.

For advanced set ups that use a custom Kibana index,
<<advanced-dashboard-mode-configuration, advanced configurations>> are possible.
