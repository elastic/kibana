== Setting Advanced Options

The *Advanced Settings* page enables you to directly edit settings that control the behavior of the Kibana application.
For example, you can change the format used to display dates, specify the default index pattern, and set the precision
for displayed decimal values.

To set advanced options:

. Go to *Settings > Advanced*.
. Scroll or use the search bar to find the option you want to modify.
. Enter a new value for the option.
. Click the *Save* button.

WARNING: Modifying the following settings can significantly affect Kibana's performance and cause problems that are
difficult to diagnose. Setting a property's value to a blank field will revert to the default behavior, which may not be
compatible with other configuration settings. Deleting a custom setting removes it from Kibana permanently.

.Kibana Settings Reference
[horizontal]
`query:queryString:options`:: Options for the Lucene query string parser.
`query:allowLeadingWildcards`:: When set, * is allowed as the first character in a query clause. Currently only applies when experimental query features are enabled in the query bar. To disallow leading wildcards in basic lucene queries, use query:queryString:options.
`search:queryLanguage`:: Default is `lucene`. Query language used by the query bar. Choose between the lucene query syntax and kuery, an experimental new language built specifically for Kibana.
`sort:options`:: Options for the Elasticsearch {ref}/search-request-sort.html[sort] parameter.
`dateFormat`:: The format to use for displaying pretty-formatted dates.
`dateFormat:tz`:: The timezone that Kibana uses. The default value of `Browser` uses the timezone detected by the browser.
`dateFormat:scaled`:: These values define the format used to render ordered time-based data. Formatted timestamps must
adapt to the interval between measurements. Keys are http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals[ISO8601 intervals].
`dateFormat:dow`:: This property defines what day weeks should start on.
`defaultIndex`:: Default is `null`. This property specifies the default index.
`defaultColumns`:: Default is `_source`. Defines the columns that appear by default on the Discover page.
`metaFields`:: An array of fields outside of `_source`. Kibana merges these fields into the document when displaying the
document.
`discover:sampleSize`:: The number of rows to show in the Discover table.
`discover:aggs:terms:size`:: Determines how many terms will be visualized when clicking the "visualize" button, in the field drop downs, in the discover sidebar. The default value is `20`.
`discover:sort:defaultOrder`:: Controls the default sort direction for time based index patterns in the Discover app.
`doc_table:highlight`:: Highlight results in Discover and Saved Searches Dashboard. Highlighting makes request slow when
working on big documents. Set this property to `false` to disable highlighting.
`doc_table:hideTimeColumn`:: Hide the 'Time' column in Discover and in all Saved Searches on Dashboards.
`search:includeFrozen`:: Will include {ref}/frozen-indices.html[frozen indices] in results if enabled. Searching through frozen indices
might increase the search time.
`courier:maxSegmentCount`:: Kibana splits requests in the Discover app into segments to limit the size of requests sent to
the Elasticsearch cluster. This setting constrains the length of the segment list. Long segment lists can significantly
increase request processing time.
`courier:ignoreFilterIfFieldNotInIndex`:: Set this property to `true` to skip filters that apply to fields that don't exist in a visualization's index. Useful when dashboards consist of visualizations from multiple index patterns.
`courier:maxConcurrentShardRequests`:: Controls the {ref}/search-multi-search.html[max_concurrent_shard_requests] setting used for _msearch requests sent by Kibana. Set to 0 to disable this config and use the Elasticsearch default.
`fields:popularLimit`:: This setting governs how many of the top most popular fields are shown.
`histogram:barTarget`:: When date histograms use the `auto` interval, Kibana attempts to generate this number of bars.
`histogram:maxBars`:: Date histograms are not generated with more bars than the value of this property, scaling values
when necessary.
`visualize:enableLabs`:: Enables experimental visualizations. Default is `true`. If this is turned off, users will not be able to create visualizations that are considered experimental. They will also not be able to add or view these visualizations on a dashboard.
`visualization:tileMap:maxPrecision`:: The maximum geoHash precision displayed on tile maps: 7 is high, 10 is very high,
12 is the maximum. {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.html#_cell_dimensions_at_the_equator[Explanation of cell dimensions].
`visualization:tileMap:WMSdefaults`:: Default properties for the WMS map server support in the coordinate map.
`visualization:colorMapping`:: Maps values to specified colors within visualizations.
`visualization:loadingDelay`:: Time to wait before dimming visualizations during query.
`visualization:dimmingOpacity`:: When part of a visualization is highlighted, by hovering over it for example, ths is the opacity applied to the other elements. A higher number means other elements will be less opaque.
`visualization:regionmap:showWarnings`:: Whether the region map show a warning when terms cannot be joined to a shape on the map.
`csv:separator`:: A string that serves as the separator for exported values.
`csv:quoteValues`:: Set this property to `true` to quote exported values.
`history:limit`:: In fields that have history, such as query inputs, the value of this property limits how many recent
values are shown.
`shortDots:enable`:: Set this property to `true` to shorten long field names in visualizations. For example, instead of `foo.bar.baz`, show `f.b.baz`.
`truncate:maxHeight`:: This property specifies the maximum height that a cell occupies in a table. A value of 0 disables
truncation.
`indexPattern:placeholder`:: The default placeholder value used when adding a new index pattern to Kibana.
`format:defaultTypeMap`:: A map of the default format name for each field type. Field types that are not explicitly
mentioned use "_default_".
`format:number:defaultPattern`:: Default numeral format for the "number" format.
`format:bytes:defaultPattern`:: Default numeral format for the "bytes" format.
`format:percent:defaultPattern`:: Default numeral format for the "percent" format.
`format:currency:defaultPattern`:: Default numeral format for the "currency" format.
`savedObjects:perPage`:: The number of objects shown on each page of the list of saved objects. The default value is 5.
`timepicker:timeDefaults`:: The default time filter selection.
`timepicker:refreshIntervalDefaults`:: The time filter's default refresh interval.
`timepicker:quickRanges`:: The list of ranges to show in the Quick section of the time picker. This should be an array of objects, with each object containing `from`, `to` (see {ref}/common-options.html#date-math[accepted formats]), `display` (the title to be displayed), and `section` (which column to put the option in).
`filters:pinnedByDefault`:: Set this property to `true` to make filters have a global state by default.
`filterEditor:suggestValues`:: Set this property to `false` to prevent the filter editor from suggesting values for fields.
`notifications:banner`:: You can specify a custom banner to display temporary notices to all users. This field supports
Markdown.
`notifications:lifetime:banner`:: Specifies the duration in milliseconds for banner notification displays. The default value is 3000000. Set this field to `Infinity` to disable banner notifications.
`notifications:lifetime:error`:: Specifies the duration in milliseconds for error notification displays. The default value is 300000. Set this field to `Infinity` to disable error notifications.
`notifications:lifetime:warning`:: Specifies the duration in milliseconds for warning notification displays. The default value is 10000. Set this field to `Infinity` to disable warning notifications.
`notifications:lifetime:info`:: Specifies the duration in milliseconds for information notification displays. The default value is 5000. Set this field to `Infinity` to disable information notifications.
`metrics:max_buckets`:: The maximum numbers of buckets that cannot be exceeded. For example, this can arise when the user selects a short interval like (e.g. 1s) for a long time period (e.g. 1 year)
`timelion:showTutorial`:: Set this property to `true` to show the Timelion tutorial to users when they first open Timelion.
`timelion:es.timefield`:: Default field containing a timestamp when using the `.es()` query.
`timelion:es.default_index`:: Default index when using the `.es()` query.
`timelion:target_buckets`:: Used for calculating automatic intervals in visualizations, this is the number of buckets to try to represent.
`timelion:max_buckets`:: Used for calculating automatic intervals in visualizations, this is the maximum number of buckets to represent.
`timelion:default_columns`:: The default number of columns to use on a timelion sheet.
`timelion:default_rows`:: The default number of rows to use on a timelion sheet.
`timelion:graphite.url`:: [experimental] Used with graphite queries, this it the URL of your host
`timelion:quandl.key`:: [experimental] Used with quandl queries, this is your API key from www.quandl.com
`state:storeInSessionStorage`:: [experimental] Kibana tracks UI state in the URL, which can lead to problems when there is a lot of information there and the URL gets very long. Enabling this will store parts of the state in your browser session instead, to keep the URL shorter.
`context:defaultSize`:: Specifies the initial number of surrounding entries to display in the context view. The default value is 5.
`context:step`:: Specifies the number to increment or decrement the context size by when using the buttons in the context view. The default value is 5.
`context:tieBreakerFields`:: A comma-separated list of fields to use for tiebreaking between documents that have the same timestamp value. From this list the first field that is present and sortable in the current index pattern is used.
