for displayed decimal values.

. Go to *Management > {kib} > Advanced Settings*.
. Scroll or search for the setting you want to modify.
. Enter a new value for the setting.
. Click *Save changes*.

=== Kibana settings reference

WARNING: Modifying a setting can affect {kib}
performance and cause problems that are
difficult to diagnose. Setting a property value to a blank field reverts
to the default behavior, which might not be
compatible with other configuration settings. Deleting a custom setting
removes it from {kib} permanently.

`format:bytes:defaultPattern`:: The default http://numeraljs.com/[numeral format] for the "bytes" format.
`format:currency:defaultPattern`:: The default http://numeraljs.com/[numeral format] for the "currency" format.

`histogram:maxBars`:: Date histograms are not generated with more bars than the value of this property, scaling values
when necessary.
`history:limit`:: In fields that have history, such as query inputs, show this many recent values.
`indexPattern:fieldMapping:lookBack`:: For index patterns containing timestamps in their names,
look for this many recent matching patterns from which to query the field mapping.
`indexPattern:placeholder`:: The default placeholder value to use in Management > Index Patterns > Create Index Pattern.
`metaFields`:: Fields that exist outside of `_source`. Kibana merges these fields

field names in visualizations. For example, show `f.b.baz` instead of `foo.bar.baz`.
`sort:options`:: Options for the Elasticsearch {ref}/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-sort[sort] parameter.
`state:storeInSessionStorage`:: [experimental] Kibana tracks UI state in the
URL, which can lead to problems when there is a lot of state information,
and the URL gets very long.
Enabling this setting stores part of the URL in your browser session to keep the
URL short.
`theme:darkMode`:: Set to `true` to enable a dark mode for the {kib} UI. You must
refresh the page to apply the setting.
`timepicker:quickRanges`:: The list of ranges to show in the Quick section of

`rollups:enableIndexPatterns`:: Enables the creation of index patterns that
capture rollup indices, which in turn enables visualizations based on rollup data.
Refresh the page to apply the changes.


[float]
[[kibana-search-settings]]
==== Search

[horizontal]
`courier:batchSearches`:: **Deprecated in 7.6. Starting in 8.0, this setting will be optimized internally.**
When disabled, dashboard panels will load individually, and search requests will terminate when
users navigate away or update the query. When enabled, dashboard panels will load together when all of the data is loaded,
and searches will not terminate.
`courier:customRequestPreference`:: {ref}/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-preference[Request preference]
to use when `courier:setRequestPreference` is set to "custom".
`courier:ignoreFilterIfFieldNotInIndex`:: Skips filters that apply to fields that don't exist in the index for a visualization.
Useful when dashboards consist of visualizations from multiple index patterns.
`courier:maxConcurrentShardRequests`:: Controls the {ref}/search-multi-search.html[max_concurrent_shard_requests]
setting used for `_msearch` requests sent by {kib}. Set to 0 to disable this
config and use the {es} default.
`courier:setRequestPreference`:: Enables you to set which shards handle your search requests.
* *Session ID:* Restricts operations to execute all search requests on the same shards.
This has the benefit of reusing shard caches across requests.
* *Custom:* Allows you to define your own preference. Use `courier:customRequestPreference`
to customize your preference value.
* *None:* Do not set a preference. This might provide better performance
because requests can be spread across all shard copies. However, results might
be inconsistent because different shards might be in different refresh states.
`search:includeFrozen`:: Includes {ref}/frozen-indices.html[frozen indices] in results.
Searching through frozen indices
might increase the search time. This setting is off by default. Users must opt-in to include frozen indices.

selected from a whitelist configured in the `kibana.yml` under `timelion.graphiteUrls`.
`timelion:max_buckets`:: The maximum number of buckets a single data source can return.
This value is used for calculating automatic intervals in visualizations.
