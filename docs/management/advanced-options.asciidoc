specify the default data view, and set the precision for displayed decimal values.

=== Edit the Advanced Settings

Change the settings to fit your organization's needs. 

WARNING: Changing a setting can affect {kib} performance and cause problems
that are difficult to diagnose. Setting a property value to a blank field
reverts to the default behavior, which might not be compatible with other
configuration settings. Deleting a custom setting permanently removes it from {kib}.

. Open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Advanced Settings*.
. Scroll or search for the setting.
. Make your change, then click *Save changes*.
