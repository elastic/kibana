== Setting advanced options

The *Advanced Settings* page enables you to directly edit settings that control the behavior of the Kibana application.
For example, you can change the format used to display dates, specify the default index pattern, and set the precision
for displayed decimal values.

. Go to *Management > {kib} > Advanced Settings*.
. Scroll or search for the setting you want to modify.
. Enter a new value for the setting.

=== Kibana settings reference

WARNING: Modifying a setting can affect {kib}
performance and cause problems that are
difficult to diagnose. Setting a property value to a blank field reverts 
to the default behavior, which might not be
compatible with other configuration settings. Deleting a custom setting 
removes it from {kib} permanently.

mentioned use "\_default_".
`format:number:defaultLocale`:: The http://numeraljs.com/[numeral language] locale.
`format:number:defaultPattern`:: The default http://numeraljs.com/[numeral format] for the "number" format.
`format:percent:defaultPattern`:: The default http://numeraljs.com/[numeral format] for the "percent" format.
`histogram:barTarget`:: When date histograms use the `auto` interval, Kibana attempts to generate this number of bars.
`histogram:maxBars`:: Date histograms are not generated with more bars than the value of this property, scaling values
when necessary.

look for this many recent matching patterns from which to query the field mapping.

in a query clause. Only applies when experimental query features are 
enabled in the query bar. To disallow leading wildcards in Lucene queries,

field names in visualizations. For example, show `f.b.baz` instead of `foo.bar.baz`.
`sort:options`:: Options for the Elasticsearch {ref}/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-sort[sort] parameter.
`state:storeInSessionStorage`:: [experimental] Kibana tracks UI state in the

`defaultColumns`:: The columns that appear by default on the Discover page.
The default is `_source`. 
`discover:aggs:terms:size`:: The number terms that are visualized when clicking

`rollups:enableIndexPatterns`:: Enables the creation of index patterns that 
capture rollup indices, which in turn enables visualizations based on rollup data.

[float]
[[kibana-search-settings]]
=== Search settings

[horizontal]
`courier:customRequestPreference`:: {ref}/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-preference[Request preference] 
to use when `courier:setRequestPreference` is set to "custom".
`courier:ignoreFilterIfFieldNotInIndex`:: Skips filters that apply to fields that don't exist in the index for a visualization. 
Useful when dashboards consist of visualizations from multiple index patterns.
`courier:maxConcurrentShardRequests`:: Controls the {ref}/search-multi-search.html[max_concurrent_shard_requests] 
setting used for `_msearch` requests sent by {kib}. Set to 0 to disable this 
config and use the {es} default.
`courier:setRequestPreference`:: Enables you to set which shards handle your search requests.
* *Session ID:* Restricts operations to execute all search requests on the same shards. 
This has the benefit of reusing shard caches across requests.
* *Custom:* Allows you to define your own preference. Use `courier:customRequestPreference` 
to customize your preference value.
* *None:* Do not set a preference. This might provide better performance 
because requests can be spread across all shard copies. However, results might 
be inconsistent because different shards might be in different refresh states.
`search:includeFrozen`:: Includes {ref}/frozen-indices.html[frozen indices] in results. 
Searching through frozen indices
might increase the search time.
