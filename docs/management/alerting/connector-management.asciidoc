=== Managing Connectors

beta[]

Alerts use *Connectors* to route actions to different destinations like log files, ticketing systems, and messaging tools. While each {kib} app can offer their own types of alerts, they typically share connectors. The *Connectors* tab offers a central place to view and manage all the connectors in the current space.

For more information on connectors and the types of actions available see <<action-types>>.

==== Connector list

The *Connectors* tab lists all connectors in the current space. The *search bar* can be used to find specific connectors by name and/or type.

The *type* dropdown also lets you filter to a subset of action types.

The *Actions* column indicates the number of actions that reference the connector. This count helps you confirm a connector is unused before you delete it, and tells you how many actions will be affected when a connector is modified.

You can delete individual connectors using the trash icon. Connectors can also be deleted in bulk by multi-selecting them and clicking the *Delete* button to the left of the search box.

[NOTE]
============================================================================
You can delete a connector even if there are still actions referencing it.
When this happens the action will fail to execute, and appear as errors in the {kib} logs.

==== Creating a new connector

New connectors can be created by clicking the *Create connector* button, which will guide you to select the type of connector and configure it's properties. Refer to <<action-types>> for the types of connectors available and how to configure them. Once you create a connector it will be made available to you anytime you set up an action in the current space.
