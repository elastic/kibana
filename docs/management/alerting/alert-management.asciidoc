=== Managing Alerts


The *Alerts* tab provides a cross-app view of alerting. Different {kib} apps like <<metrics-app,Metrics>>, <<xpack-apm,APM>>, <<uptime-app,Uptime>>, and <<xpack-siem,SIEM>> can offer their own alerts, and the *Alerts* tab provides a central place to:

* <<create-edit-alerts, Create and edit>> alerts
* <<controlling-alerts, Control alerts>> including enabling/disabling, muting/unmuting, and deleting
* Drill-down to <<alert-details, alert details>>
