== Alerts and Actions

beta[]

The *Alerts and Actions* UI lets you <<alert-management, see and control all the alerts>> in a space, and provides tools to <<connector-management, create and manage connectors>> so that alerts can trigger actions like notification, indexing, and ticketing. 

To manage alerting and connectors, open the menu, then go to *Stack Management > {kib} > Alerts and Actions*.
