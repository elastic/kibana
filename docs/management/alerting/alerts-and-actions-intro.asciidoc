== Alerts and Actions


The *Alerts and Actions* UI lets you <<alert-management, see and control all the alerts>> in a space, and provides tools to <<connector-management, create and manage connectors>> so that alerts can trigger actions like notification, indexing, and ticketing.

To manage alerting and connectors, open the main menu,
then click *Stack Management > Alerts and Insights > Alerts and Actions*.
