== Rules and Connectors


The *Rules and Connectors* UI lets you <<alert-management, see and control all the rules>> in a space, and provides tools to <<connector-management, create and manage connectors>> so that rules can trigger actions like notification, indexing, and ticketing.

To manage rules and connectors, open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Alerts and Insights > Rules and Connectors*.
