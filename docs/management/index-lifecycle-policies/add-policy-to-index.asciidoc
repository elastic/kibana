=== Adding a policy to an index

You can add a lifecycle policy to an index and view the status for indices 
managed by a policy in *Management > {es} > Index Management*.  This page lists your 
{es} indices, which you can filter by lifecycle status and lifecycle phase.  

To add a policy, select the index name and then select *Manage > Add lifecycle policy*.
Youâ€™ll see the policy name, the phase the index is in, the current 
action, and if any errors occurred performing that action. 

To remove a policy from an index, select *Manage > Remove lifecycle policy*.
