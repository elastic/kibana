=== Example of using an index lifecycle policy

A common use case for managing index lifecycle policies is when you’re using 
{beats-ref}/beats-reference.html[Beats] to continually send time-series data, 
such as metrics and log data, to {es}.  When you create the Beats packages, an 
index template is installed.  The template includes a default policy to apply 
when new indices are created.  

You can edit the policy in {kib}'s *Index Lifecycle Policies*.  For example, you might:

* Rollover the index when it reaches 50 GB in size or is 30 days old.  These 
settings are the default for the Beats lifecycle policy. This avoids 
having 1000s of tiny indices. When a rollover occurs, a new “hot” index is 
created and added to the index alias.

* Move the index into the warm phase, shrink the index down to a single shard, 
and force merge to a single segment.

* After 60 days, move the index into the cold phase and onto less expensive hardware.

* Delete the index after 90 days.
