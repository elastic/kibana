=== Tutorial:  Use ILM to manage Filebeat time-based indices

With index lifecycle management (ILM), you can create policies to define actions
that are automatically performed against indices as they age.  In this tutorial,
you will use {kib}’s *Index Lifecycle Policies* to modify and create ILM policies.

==== Scenario

You’ve been tasked with sending syslog files to an {es} cluster. This
project has the following data retention guidelines for log data:

* Keep logs on hot data nodes for 30 days
* Rollover to a new index if the size reaches 50GB
* After 30 days:
** Move the logs to warm data nodes
** Set replicas to 1
** Force merge indices to a single segment
* Delete logs after 90 days


[float]
==== Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

* An {es} cluster with hot and warm nodes configured for shard allocation
awareness. If you’re using https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-getting-started-templates-hot-warm.html[Elasticsearch Service],
choose the hot-warm architecture deployment template.

+
For a self-managed cluster, use https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/allocation-awareness.html[shard allocation awareness]
to label data nodes as hot or warm. This step is required to migrate shards between
nodes using shard allocation awareness.
+
For example, you can set this in `elasticsearch.yml` for each data node:
+
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
node.attr.data: "warm"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A server with Filebeat installed and configured to send logs to the `elasticsearch`
output as described in https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-getting-started.html[Getting Started with Filebeat].

==== View the Filebeat ILM policy

Filebeat includes a default ILM policy that enables rollover. Index lifecycle
management is enabled automatically if you’re using the default `filebeat.yml`
and index template.

To view the default policy in {kib}, go to *Management > Index Lifecycle Policies*,
search for _filebeat_, and choose the _filebeat-version_ policy.

This policy initiates the rollover action when the index size reaches 50G or 30
days old.

==== Modify the policy

The default policy is enough to prevent the creation of many tiny daily indices.
You can modify the policy to meet more complex requirements.

. Activate the warm phase.

+
. Set either of the following options to control when the index moves to the warm phase:

** Provide a value for *Timing for warm phase*. Setting this to *15* will keep the
indices on hot nodes for a range of  15-45 days, depending on when the initial
rollover occurred.

** Enable *Move to warm phase on rollover*. The index might move to the warm phase
more quickly than intended if it reaches the *Maximum index size* before
*Maximum age*.

. In *Select a node attribute to control shard allocation*, select *data:warm(2)* in
the dropdown to migrate shards to warm data nodes.

. Change *Number of replicas* to *1*.

. Enable *Force merge data* and set *Number of segments* to *1*.
+
NOTE:  When rollover is enabled in the hot phase, action timing in the other phases
is based on the rollover date.

. Activate the delete phase and set *Timing for delete phase* to *90* days.

==== Create a custom policy

If meeting a specific retention time period is your most important priority, you
can create a custom policy.  For this option, you will use Filebeat daily indices
without rollover.

To create a custom policy in {kib}, go to *Management > Index Lifecycle Policies >
Create Policy*.


. Activate the warm phase and configure it as follows:
+
|===
|*Setting* |*Value*

|Timing for warm phase
|30 days from index creation

|Node attribute
|`data:warm`

|Number of replicas
|1

|Force merge data
|enable

|Number of segments
|1
|===

+
. Activate the delete phase and set the timing.
+
|===
|*Setting* |*Value*
|Timing for delete phase
|90
|===

+

. Configure the index to use the new policy in *{kib} > Management > Index Lifecycle
Policies > _Select your custom policy_ > Actions > Add policy to template > Select
your Filebeat index template*

+
NOTE: If you initially used the default Filebeat ILM policy, you will see a notice that the
template already has a policy associated with it. Confirm that you want to
overwrite that configuration.

TIP: When you change the policy associated with the index template, the active
index will continue to use the policy it was associated with at index creation
unless you manually update it. The next new index will use the updated policy.
For more reasons that your ILM policy changes might be delayed, see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/update-lifecycle-policy.html#update-lifecycle-policy[Update Lifecycle Policy].
