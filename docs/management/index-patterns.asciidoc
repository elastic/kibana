== Creating an index pattern

An index pattern tells {kib} which {es} indices contain the data that you want to work with.
Once you’ve created an index pattern, you're ready to analyze your data, including:

* Interactively exploring your data in <<discover, Discover>>.
* Presenting your data in charts, tables, gauges, tag clouds, and more in <<visualize, Visualize>>.
* Showing off your data in a <<canvas, Canvas>> presentation.
* If your data includes geo data, visualizing it with <<maps, Maps>>.

=== [xpack]#Read-only access#
If you have insufficient privileges to create or save index patterns, a read-only
indicator appears in Kibana. The buttons to create new index patterns or save
existing index patterns are not visible. For more information on granting access to
Kibana, see <<xpack-security-authorization>>.

=== Create an index pattern

If you are in an app that requires an index pattern, and you don't have one yet,
{kib} prompts you to create one.  Or, you can go directly to
*Management > Kibana > Index Patterns* to create one.

==== Standard index pattern

Just start typing in the *Index pattern* field, and {kib} looks for
the names of {es} indices that match your input. Make sure that the name of the
index pattern is unique.
To include system indices in your search, toggle the switch in the upper right.

image:management/index-patterns/images/create-index-pattern.png["Create index pattern"]

Your index pattern can match multiple {es} indices.
Use a comma to separate the names, with no space after the comma. The notation for
wildcards (`*`) and the ability to "exclude" (`-`) also apply
(for example, `test*,-test3`).

If {kib} detects an index with a timestamp, you’re asked to choose a field to
filter your data by time. If you don’t specify a field, you won’t be able
to use the time filter.

==== Rollup index patterns

If a rollup index is detected in the cluster, clicking *Create index pattern*
includes an item for creating a rollup index pattern.
You can match an index pattern to only rolled up data, or mix both rolled
up and raw data to explore and visualize all data together.
An index pattern can match
only one rollup index.

[[management-cross-cluster-search]]
==== {ccs-cap} index pattern

If your {es} clusters are configured for {ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[{ccs}], you can create
index patterns to search across the clusters of your choosing. Using the
same syntax that you'd use in a raw {ccs} request in {es}, create your
index pattern with the convention `<cluster-names>:<pattern>`.

For example, to query {ls} indices across two {es} clusters
that you set up for {ccs}, which are named `cluster_one` and `cluster_two`,
you would use `cluster_one:logstash-*,cluster_two:logstash-*` as your index pattern.

You can use wildcards in your cluster names
to match any number of clusters, so if you want to search {ls} indices across
clusters named `cluster_foo`, `cluster_bar`, and so on, you would use `cluster_*:logstash-*`
as your index pattern.

To query across all {es} clusters that have been configured for {ccs},
use a standalone wildcard for your cluster name in your index
pattern: `*:logstash-*`.

Once an index pattern is configured using the {ccs} syntax, all searches and
aggregations using that index pattern in {kib} take advantage of {ccs}.

=== Manage your index pattern

Once you create an index pattern, manually or with a sample data set,
you might want look under the covers and view its fields and associated data types.
Or, you might want to set the index pattern as the default.
You can perform these actions, and delete an index pattern you no longer need, in
*Management > Index patterns*.

From this view, you can perform the following actions:

* *Manage the index fields.* Click a column header to sort the table by that column.
Use the field dropdown menu to limit to display to a specific field.
See <<managing-fields, Managing fields>> for more detailed information.

* [[set-default-pattern]]*Set the default index pattern.* {kib} uses a badge to make users
aware of which index pattern is the default. The first pattern
you create is automatically designated as the default pattern. The default
index pattern is loaded when you open *Discover*.

* [[reload-fields]]*Reload the index fields list.* You can reload the index fields list to
pick up any newly-added fields. Doing so also resets Kibana’s popularity counters
for the fields. The popularity counters keep track of the fields
you’ve used most often in {kib} and are used to sort fields in lists.

* [[delete-pattern]]*Delete the index pattern.* This action removes the pattern from the list of
Saved Objects in {kib}. You will not be able to recover field formatters,
scripted fields, source filters, and field popularity data associated with the index pattern.
+
Deleting an index pattern breaks all visualizations, saved searches, and
other saved objects that reference the pattern. Deleting an index pattern does
not remove any indices or data documents from {es}.
