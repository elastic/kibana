Ready to get some hands-on experience with {kib}? There are two ways to start:

* <<tutorial-sample-data, Explore {kib} using a sample data set>>
+
The data set includes a pre-packaged dashboard. You can experiment with {kib} 
without having to go through the process of loading the data.

* <<tutorial-your-data, Get the full experience using Kibana>> 
+
Youâ€™ll walk through the process of loading data, creating an index pattern, 
visualizing data, and assembling visualizations into a dashboard.


Before you begin, make sure you've <<install, installed Kibana>> and established
a {kibana-ref}/connect-to-elasticsearch.html[connection to Elasticsearch].

video tutorial.

If you are running our https://cloud.elastic.co[hosted Elasticsearch Service] 
on Elastic Cloud, you can access Kibana with a single click.
