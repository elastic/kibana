*Action* +
ADD INSTRUCTIONS FOR USERS LOOKING TO UPGRADE. HOW CAN THEY WORK AROUND THIS?
====


1. Copy and edit the template in the right section of this file. Most recent entries should be at the top of the section, search for sections using the text "[float]".
2. Edit the anchor ID [[REPO-PR]] of the template with proper values.
3. Don't hardcode the link to the new entry. Instead, make it available through the doc link service files:
  - https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/packages/kbn-doc-links/src/get_doc_links.ts
  - https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/packages/kbn-doc-links/src/types.ts

The entry in the main links file should look like this:

id: `${KIBANA_DOCS}breaking-changes-summary.html#REPO-PR`

Where:
      - `id` is the ID of your choice.
      - `REPO-PR` is the anchor ID that you assigned to the entry in this upgrade document.

4. You can then call the link from any Kibana code. For example: `href: docLinks.links.upgradeAssistant.id`
Check https://docs.elastic.dev/docs/kibana-doc-links (internal) for more details about the Doc links service.

Before you upgrade, review the breaking changes and deprecations introduced since the version you are migrating from, then mitigate the impact.

If you are migrating from a version prior to version 9.0, you must first upgrade to the last 8.x version available.
