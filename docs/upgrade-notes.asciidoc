=== Breaking changes

[discrete]
.Added rate limiting to install by upload endpoint. (8.15)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Rate limiting was added to the upload `api/fleet/epm/packages` endpoint. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}184036[#184036].

*Impact* +
If you do two or more requests in less than 10 seconds, the subsequent requests fail with `429 Too Many Requests`.
Wait 10 seconds before uploading again.
This change could potentially break automations for users that rely on frequent package uploads.
====

[discrete]
.Renamed an advanced setting to enable {esql}. (8.14)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The advanced setting which hides {esql} from the UI has been renamed from `discover:enableESQL` to `enableESQL`. It is enabled by default and must be switched off to disable {esql} features from your {kib} applications. For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}182074[#182074]).
====

[discrete]
.Removed conditional topics for Kafka outputs. (8.13)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The Kafka output no longer supports conditional topics. For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}176879[#176879]).
====

[discrete]
.Most Fleet installed integrations are now read-only and labelled with a *Managed* tag in the Kibana UI. (8.13)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +

Integration content installed by {fleet} is no longer editable. This content is tagged with *Managed* in the {kib} UI, and is Elastic managed. This content cannot be edited or deleted. However, managed visualizations, dashboards, and saved searches can be cloned. The clones can be customized.

When cloning a dashboard the cloned panels become entirely independent copies that are unlinked from the original configurations and dependencies.

Managed content relating to specific visualization editors such as Lens, TSVB, and Maps, the clones retain the original reference configurations. The same applies to editing any saved searches in a managed visualization.

For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}172393[#172393]).
====

[discrete]
.Removed `is_nan`, `is_finite`, and `is_infinite` functions from {esql}. (8.13)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
These functions have been removed from {esql} queries as they are not supported. Errors would be thrown when trying to use them. For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}174674[#174674]).
====

[discrete]
.New SLO architecture. (8.12)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
We introduce a breaking change in the SLO features that will break any SLOs created before 8.12. These SLOs have to be manually reset through an API until we provide a UI for it. The data aggregated over time (rollup) is still available in the sli v2 index, but won't be used for summary calculation when reset.

The previous summary transforms summarizing every SLOs won't be used anymore and can be stopped and deleted:

* slo-summary-occurrences-7d-rolling
* slo-summary-occurrences-30d-rolling
* slo-summary-occurrences-90d-rolling
* slo-summary-occurrences-monthly-aligned
* slo-summary-occurrences-weekly-aligned
* slo-summary-timeslices-7d-rolling
* slo-summary-timeslices-30d-rolling
* slo-summary-timeslices-90d-rolling
* slo-summary-timeslices-monthly-aligned
* slo-summary-timeslices-weekly-aligned

Be aware that when installing a new SLO (or after resetting an SLO), we install two transforms (one for the rollup data and one that summarize the rollup data). Do not delete the new `slo-summary-{slo_id}-{slo_revision}` transforms. For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}172224[#172224]).
====

[discrete]
.A new sub-feature privilege to control user access to the cases settings. (8.12)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Roles with at least a sub-feature privilege configured will not have access to the cases setting like they had previously. All roles without a sub-feature privilege configured will not be affected. For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}170635[#170635]).
====

[discrete]
.Improved config output validation for default output. (8.11)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Improve config output validation to not allow to defining multiple default outputs in {kib} configuration. For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}167085[#167085]).
====

[discrete]
.Converted filterQuery to KQL.(8.11)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Converts `filterQuery` to a KQL query string. For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}161806[#161806]).
====

[discrete]
.Moved doc_root.vulnerability.package to doc_root.package (ECS). (8.11)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
This updates all instances of vulnerability.package to the ECS standard package fieldset. For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}164651[#164651]).
====

[discrete]
.Introduced new summary search capabilities that will cause existing SLOs to stop working. (8.10)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
New summary search capabilities introduce breaking changes in various places, and we have decided not to handle backward compatibility:

* SLO find API body parameters have changed.
* The index mapping used by the rollup data has changed, and we have added a summary index that becomes the new source of truth for search.
* The rollup transforms have been updated, but existing SLO with their transforms won't be updated.

If some SLOs have been installed in a prior version at 8.10, they won't work after migrating to 8.10. There are two approaches to handle this breaking change. The recommended route is to delete all SLOs before migrating to 8.10. The alternative is to migrate to 8.10 and manually remove the SLOs.

*Removing SLOs before migrating to 8.10*

Use the SLO UI or the SLO delete API to delete all existing SLOs. This takes care of the Saved Object, Transform and rollup data. When all SLOs have been deleted, then delete the residual rollup indices: `.slo-observability.sli-v1*`. Note that this is v1.

*Removing SLOs after migrating to 8.10*

After migrating to 8.10, the previously created SLOs wonâ€™t appear in the UI because the API is using a new index. The previously created SLOs still exist, and associated transforms are still rolling up data into the previous index `.slo-observability.sli-v1*`. The SLO delete API can't be used now, so remove the resources resources manually:

. Find all existing transforms
All SLO related transforms start with the `slo-` prefix, this request returns them all:
+
[source, bash]
----
GET _transform/slo-*
----
+
Make a note of all the transforms IDs for later.

. Stop all transforms
+
[source, bash]
----
POST _transform/slo-*/_stop?force=true
----

. Remove all transforms
+
From the list of transforms returned during the first step, now delete them one by one:
+
[source, bash]
----
DELETE _transform/{transform_id}?force=true
----

. Find the SLO saved objects
+
This request lists all the SLO saved objects. The SLO IDs and the saved object IDs are not the same.
+
[source, bash]
----
GET kbn:/api/saved_objects/_find?type=slo
----
+
Make a note of all the saved object IDs from the response.

. Remove the SLO saved objects
+
For each saved object ID, run the following:
+
[source, bash]
----
DELETE kbn:/api/saved_objects/slo/{Saved_Object_Id}
----

. Delete the rollup indices v1
+
Note that this is v1.
+
[source, bash]
----
DELETE .slo-observability.sli-v1*
----
====

[discrete]
.Get case metrics APIs became internal. (8.10)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +

====

[discrete]
.New case limits. (8.10)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Limits are now imposed on the number of objects cases can process or the amount of data those objects can store.
////
For example:
* Updating a case comment is now included in the 10000 user actions restriction. ({kibana-pull}163150[#163150])
* Updating a case now fails if the operation makes it reach more than 10000 user actions. ({kibana-pull}161848[#161848])
* The total number of characters per comment is limited to 30000. ({kibana-pull}161357[#161357])
* The getConnectors API now limits the number of supported connectors returned to 1000. ({kibana-pull}161282[#161282])
* There are new limits and restrictions when retrieving cases. ({kibana-pull}162411[#162411]), ({kibana-pull}162245[#162245]), ({kibana-pull}161111[#161111]), ({kibana-pull}160705[#160705])
* A case can now only have 100 external references and persistable state(excluding files) attachments combined. ({kibana-pull}162071[#162071]).
* New limits on titles, descriptions, tags and category. ({kibana-pull}160844[#160844]).
* The maximum number of cases that can be updated simultaneously is now 100. The minimum is 1. ({kibana-pull}161076[#161076]).
* The Delete cases API now limits the number of cases to be deleted to 100.({kibana-pull}160846[#160846]).

====

[discrete]
.The Download CSV endpoint has changed. (8.10)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The API endpoint for downloading a CSV file from a saved search in the Dashboard application has changed to reflect the fact that this is an internal API. The previous API path of
`/api/reporting/v1/generate/immediate/csv_searchsource` has been changed to `/internal/reporting/generate/immediate/csv_searchsource`. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}162288[#162288].
====

[discrete]
.Uptime app now hidden when no data is available. (8.9)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The Uptime app now gets hidden from the interface when it doesn't have any data for more than a week. If you have a standalone Heartbeat pushing data to Elasticsearch, the Uptime app is considered active. You can disable this automatic behavior from the advanced settings in Kibana using the **Always show legacy Uptime app** option.

*Impact* +
To generate CSV reports, grant `read` privileges to the underlying indices.
====

[discrete]
.Updated bulk action API to return actionId instead of agent success. (8.5)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
To make bulk action responses consistent, returns `actionId` instead of agent ids with `success: True` or `success: False` results. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}141757[#141757].

*Impact* +
To configure `setxpack.fleet.agents.fleet_server.hosts` and `xpack.fleet.agents.elasticsearch.hosts` on the Fleet UI, avoid configuring the settings in kibana.yml.
====

[discrete]
.Removed the legacy Timelion charts library. (8.4)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The legacy implementation of the *Timelion* visualization charts library has been removed. All *Timelion* visualizations now use the elastic-charts library, which was introduced in 7.15.0.

For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}134336[#134336].

*Impact* +
In 8.4.0 and later, you are unable to configure the *Timelion* legacy charts library advanced setting. For information about visualization Advanced Settings, check link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/8.4/advanced-options.html#kibana-visualization-settings[Visualization].
====

[discrete]
.Removed Quandl and Graphite integrations. (8.3)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The experimental `.quandl` and `.graphite` functions and advanced settings are removed from *Timelion*. For more information, check {kibana-pull}129581[#129581].

[discrete]
."All" base privilege option now also applies to Osquery. (8.3)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The Osquery {kib} privilege has been updated, so that when the *Privileges for all features level* is set to *All*, this now applies *All* to Osquery privileges as well. Previously, users had to choose the *Customize* option to grant any access to Osquery. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}130523[#130523].

*Impact* +
This impacts user roles that have *Privileges for all features* set to *All*. After this update, users with this role will have access to the Osquery page in {kib}. However, to use the Osquery feature fully, these requirements remain the same: users also need Read access to the logs-osquery_manager.result* index and the Osquery Manager integration must be deployed to Elastic Agents.
====

[discrete]
.Removed legacy CSV export type. (8.1)
[%collapsible]

=== Deprecation notices

The following functionality is deprecated and will be removed at a future date. Deprecated functionality 
does not have an immediate impact on your application, but we strongly recommend you make the necessary 
updates to avoid use of deprecated features.

Use the **Kibana Upgrade Assistant** to prepare for your upgrade to the next version of the Elastic Stack. 
The assistant identifies deprecated settings in your configuration and guides you through the process of 
resolving issues if any deprecated features are enabled. 
To access the assistant, go to **Stack Management** > **Upgrade Assistant**.

.Downloading a CSV file from a saved search panel in a dashboard has become deprecated in favor of generating a CSV report. (8.14)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The mechanism of exporting CSV data from a saved search panel in a dashboard has been changed to generate a CSV report, rather than allowing the CSV data to be downloaded
without creating a report. To preserve the original behavior, it is necessary to update `kibana.yml` with the setting of `xpack.reporting.csv.enablePanelActionDownload:
true`. The scope of this breaking change is limited to downloading CSV files from saved search panels only; downloading CSV files from other types of dashboard panels is
unchanged. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}178159[#178159].
====

[discrete]
.Action variables in the UI and in tests that were no longer used have been replaced. (8.10)
