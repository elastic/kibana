1. Copy and edit the template in the right area section of this file. Most recent entries should be at the top of the section. 
2. Edit the anchor ID [[REPO-PR]] of the template with proper values. 
3. Don't hardcode the link to the new entry. Instead, make it available through the doc link service files:
  - https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/packages/kbn-doc-links/src/get_doc_links.ts
  - https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/packages/kbn-doc-links/src/types.ts

The entry in the main links file should look like this:

id: `${KIBANA_DOCS}breaking-changes-summary.html#REPO-PR`

Where:
      - `id` is the ID of your choice.   
      - `REPO-PR` is the anchor ID that you assigned to the entry in this upgrade document.

4. You can then call the link from any Kibana code. For example: `href: docLinks.links.upgradeAssistant.id`
Check https://docs.elastic.dev/docs/kibana-doc-links (internal) for more details about the Doc links service.

.[SLOs]New SLO architecture. (8.12)
[%collapsible]

*Details* +
We introduced a breaking change in the SLO features that will break any SLOs created before 8.12. These SLOs have to be manually reset through an API until we provide a UI for it. The data aggregated over time (rollup) is still available in the SLI v2 index, but won't be used for summary calculation when reset.

The previous summary transforms summarizing every SLOs won't be used anymore and can be stopped and deleted:

* slo-summary-occurrences-7d-rolling
* slo-summary-occurrences-30d-rolling
* slo-summary-occurrences-90d-rolling
* slo-summary-occurrences-monthly-aligned

* slo-summary-timeslices-30d-rolling
* slo-summary-timeslices-90d-rolling
* slo-summary-timeslices-monthly-aligned
* slo-summary-timeslices-weekly-aligned

Be aware that when installing a new SLO (or after resetting an SLO), we install two transforms (one for the rollup data and one that summarize the rollup data). Do not delete the new `slo-summary-{slo_id}-{slo_revision}` transforms. For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}172224[#172224]).

.[SLO] Introduced new summary search capabilities that will cause SLOs created before 8.10 to stop working. (8.10)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +

* SLO find API body parameters have changed.
* The index mapping used by the rollup data has changed, and we have added a summary index that becomes the new source of truth for search.
* The rollup transforms have been updated, but existing SLO with their transforms won't be updated.

If some SLOs have been installed in a prior version at 8.10, they won't work after migrating to 8.10. There are two approaches to handle this breaking change. The recommended route is to delete all SLOs before migrating to 8.10. The alternative is to migrate to 8.10 and manually remove the SLOs.

*Removing SLOs before migrating to 8.10*

Use the SLO UI or the SLO delete API to delete all existing SLOs. This takes care of the saved object, transform and rollup data. When all SLOs have been deleted, then delete the residual rollup indices: `.slo-observability.sli-v1*`. Note that this is v1.

*Removing SLOs after migrating to 8.10*

After migrating to 8.10, the previously created SLOs won’t appear in the UI because the API is using a new index. The previously created SLOs still exist, and associated transforms are still rolling up data into the previous index `.slo-observability.sli-v1*`. The SLO delete API can't be used now, so remove the resources resources manually:

. Find all existing transforms
All SLO related transforms start with the `slo-` prefix, this request returns them all:
+
[source, bash]
----
GET _transform/slo-*
----
+
Make a note of all the transforms IDs for later.

. Stop all transforms
+
[source, bash]
----
POST _transform/slo-*/_stop?force=true
----

. Remove all transforms
+
From the list of transforms returned during the first step, now delete them one by one:
+
[source, bash]
----
DELETE _transform/{transform_id}?force=true
----

. Find the SLO saved objects
+
This request lists all the SLO saved objects. The SLO IDs and the saved object IDs are not the same.
+
[source, bash]
----
GET kbn:/api/saved_objects/_find?type=slo
----
+
Make a note of all the saved object IDs from the response.

. Remove the SLO saved objects
+
For each saved object ID, run the following:
+
[source, bash]
----
DELETE kbn:/api/saved_objects/slo/{Saved_Object_Id}
----

. Delete the rollup indices v1

Note that this is v1.
