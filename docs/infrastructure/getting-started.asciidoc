== Getting started with infrastructure monitoring


//+ I could leave this for now, pending the other document

// +++ to do. this is the text from Logging, suitable updated. It's not really much help as the referenced document leaves you on your own.

Kibana provides step-by-step instructions to help you add metrics data. The
{infra-guide}[Infrastructure Monitoring Guide] is a good source for more
detailed information and instructions.
