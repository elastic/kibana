Use the interactive Infrastructure UI to monitor your infrastructure and
identify problems in real time. You can explore metrics and logs for common
servers, containers, and services.

== Add data

Kibana provides step-by-step instructions to help you add log data. The
{infra-guide}[Infrastructure Monitoring Guide] is a good source for more
detailed information and instructions.

== Configure data sources 

The `metricbeat-*` index pattern is used to query the data by default.
If your metrics are located in a different set of indices, or use a
different timestamp field, you can adjust the source configuration via the user
interface or the {kib} configuration file.

NOTE: Logs and Infrastructure share a common data source definition in
each space. Changes in one of them can influence the data displayed in the
other.

[float]
=== Configure source

Configure source can be accessed via the corresponding
image:logs/images/logs-configure-source-gear-icon.png[Configure source icon]
button in the toolbar:

This opens the source configuration fly-out dialog, in which the following
configuration items can be inspected and adjusted:

* *Name*: The name of the source configuration.
* *Indices*: The patterns of the elasticsearch indices to read metrics and logs
  from.
* *Fields*: The names of particular fields in the indices that need to be known
  to the Infrastructure and Logs UIs in order to query and interpret the data
  correctly.

TIP: If <<xpack-spaces>> are enabled in your Kibana instance, any configuration
changes performed via Configure source are specific to that space. You can
therefore easily make different subsets of the data available by creating
multiple spaces with different data source configurations.

[[infra-read-only-access]]
=== Read only access
When you have insufficient privileges to change the source configuration, the following
indicator in Kibana will be displayed. The buttons to change the source configuration
won't be visible. For more information on granting access to
Kibana see <<xpack-security-authorization>>.

[float]
=== Configuration file

The settings in the configuration file are used as a fallback when no other
configuration for that space has been defined. They are located in the
configuration namespace `xpack.infra.sources.default`. See
<<infrastructure-ui-settings-kb>> for a complete list of the possible entries.
