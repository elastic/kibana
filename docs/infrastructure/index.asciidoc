Use the interactive Infrastructure UI to monitor your infrastructure and
identify problems in real time. You can explore metrics and logs for common
servers, containers, and services.

== Add data sources
Kibana provides step-by-step instructions to help you add your data sources.
The {infra-guide}[Infrastructure Monitoring Guide] is a good source for more detailed
instructions and information.

[float]
== Configure data sources 

By default the Infrastructure UI uses the `metricbeat-*` index pattern to query the data. If you configured Metricbeat to export data to a different set of indices, you will need to set `xpack.infra.sources.default.metricAlias` in `config/kibana.yml` to match your index pattern. You can also configure the timestamp field by overriding `xpack.infra.sources.default.fields.timestamp`. See <<infrastructure-ui-settings-kb>> for a complete list.
