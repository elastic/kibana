The Infrastructure UI enables you to monitor your infrastructure and identify problems in real time.
You start with a visual summary of your infrastructure where you can view basic metrics for common servers, containers, and services.
Then you can drill down to view more detailed metrics.
Alternatively, you can select a single component and view the metrics for that component, or seamlessly switch to view the corresponding logs, application traces or uptime information for that component.

You can:

* View an inventory of your infrastructure by hosts, Kubernetes pod or Docker containers.
You can group and filter the data in various ways to help you identify the items that interest you.

* View current and historic values for metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic for each component.
The available metrics depend on the kind of component being inspected.

* Use *Metrics Explorer* to group and visualize multiple customizable metrics for one or more components in a graphical format.
You can optionally save these views and add them to {kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[dashboards].

* Seamlessly switch to view the corresponding logs, application traces or uptime information for a component.
