== Viewing metrics

// ***** To do

here's some dummy content for now. this describes the detailed metrics screen.

We will have a quick screenshot, a description of the (kind of) things you can see/click, what happens when you do, and, non-intuitively, how to get back to the infrastructure screen.

Why do I sometimes get a Hosts AND Kubernetes view, and sometimes just one? see for example snagit screenshot of 2019-07-25_19_18_25 has both. but sometimes there is only one?
