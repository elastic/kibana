Something about whether it refreshes or not.

// +++ I think there are bugs here

// +++ Next (from last/next) doesn't always seem to work

// ++ It seems to start up at some random time (not particularly asked for) that doesn't match the default settings (see screenshot)

// +++ Could the next/prev time periods be outside the time selector? Or is that a stanbdard control?

// +++ Refresh seems to drop metrics to zero before redrawing

// ++ Is it time selector, or something else? the one in Metrics Explorer is different.

// ++ How does refresh work for historic values? It's meaningless, surely?

// ++ things like next (>) and previous (<) also don't seem to work for preselected time periods, for example "Yesterday"
