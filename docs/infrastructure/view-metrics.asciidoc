=== Specify the time and date range

Use the time filter to select the time and date range for the metrics.

To quickly select some popular time range options, click the calendar dropdown image:infrastructure/images/time-filter-calendar.png[]. In this popup you can choose from:

* *Quick select* to choose a recent time range, and use the back and forward arrows to move through the time ranges
* *Commonly used* to choose a time range from some commonly used options such as *Last 15 minutes*, *Today*, or *Week to date*
* *Refresh every* to specify an auto-refresh rate

NOTE: When you start auto-refresh from within this dialog, the calendar dropdown changes to a clock image:infrastructure/images/time-filter-clock.png[].

For complete control over the start and end times, click the start time or end time shown in the bar beside the calendar dropdown. In this popup, you can choose from the *Absolute*, *Relative* or *Now* tabs, then specify the required options.
