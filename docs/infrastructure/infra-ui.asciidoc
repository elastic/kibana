== Using the Metrics app

Use the Metrics app in {kib} to monitor your infrastructure and identify problems in real time.
You can explore metrics for hosts, containers, and services.
You can also drill down to view more detailed metrics, or seamlessly switch to view the corresponding logs, application traces, and uptime information.

Initially, the *Inventory* tab shows an overview of the hosts in of your infrastructure and the current CPU usage for each host.
From here, you can drill down into areas of interest.

[[infra-cat]]
=== Choose the high-level view of your infrastructure

Select the high-level view from *Hosts*, *Kubernetes*, or *Docker*.
When you change views, you see the same data through the perspective of a different category.

The default representation is the *Map view*, which shows your components in a _waffle map_ of one or more rectangular grids.
If the view you select has a large number of components, you can hover over a component to see the details for that component. Alternatively, if you would prefer to see your infrastructure as a table, click *Table view*.

[float]
[[infra-metric]]
=== Select the metric to view

Select the metric to view from the *Metric* dropdown list.
The available metrics are those that are most relevant for the high-level view you selected.

[float]
[[infra-group]]
=== Group components

Select the way you want to group the infrastructure components from the *Group By* dropdown list.
The available options are specific to your physical, virtual, or container-based infrastructure.
Examples of grouping options include *Availability Zone*, *Machine Type*, *Project ID*, and *Cloud Provider* for hosts, and *Namespace* and *Node* for Kubernetes.

[float]
[[infra-search]]
=== Use the power of search

Use the search bar to perform ad hoc searches for specific text.
You can also create structured searches using {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language].
For example, enter `host.hostname : "host1"` to see only the information for `host1`.

[float]
[[infra-date]]
=== Specify the time and date

Click the time filter image:infrastructure/images/infra-time-selector.png[time filter icon] to choose the timeframe for the metrics.
The values shown are the values for the last minute at the specified time and date.

[float]
[[infra-refresh]]
=== Auto-refresh metrics

Select *Auto-refresh* to keep up-to-date metrics information coming in, or *Stop refreshing* to focus on historical data without new distractions.

[float]
[[infra-configure-source]]
=== Configure the data to use for your metrics

If your metrics have custom index patterns, or use non-default field settings, you can override the default configuration settings.

The default source configuration for metrics is specified in the {kibana-ref}/infrastructure-ui-settings-kb.html[Metrics app settings] in the {kibana-ref}/settings.html[Kibana configuration file].
The default configuration uses the `metricbeat-*` index pattern to query the data.
The default configuration also defines field settings for things like timestamps and container names.

To change the configuration settings, click the *Settings* tab.

NOTE: These settings are shared with logs. Changes you make here may also affect the settings used by the *Logs* app.

In the *Settings* tab, you can change the values in these sections:

* *Name*: the name of the source configuration
* *Indices*: the index pattern or patterns in the Elasticsearch indices to read metrics data and log data from
* *Fields*: the names of specific fields in the indices that are used to query and interpret the data correctly

When you have completed your changes, click *Apply*.

If the fields are greyed out and cannot be edited, you may not have sufficient privileges to change the source configuration.
For more information see <<xpack-security-authorization>>.

TIP: If <<xpack-spaces>> are enabled in your Kibana instance, any configuration changes you make here are specific to the current space.
You can make different subsets of data available by creating multiple spaces with different data source configurations.

[[infra-metrics-explorer]]
=== Visualize multiple metrics in Metrics Explorer

<<metrics-explorer, Metrics Explorer>> allows you to visualize and analyze metrics for multiple components in a powerful and configurable way. Click the *Metrics Explorer* tab to get started.

[float]
[[infra-drill-down]]
=== Drill down for related information

Hover over a component to see more information about that component.

Click a component to see the other actions available for that component.
You can:

* Select *View Metrics* to <<xpack-view-metrics, view detailed infrastructure metrics>>.

* Select *View Logs* to <<xpack-logs-using, view the logs>> in the *Logs* app.

Depending on the features you have installed and configured, you may also be able to:

* Select *View APM* to <<traces, view APM traces>> in the *APM* app.

* Select *View Uptime* to <<uptime-overview, view uptime information>> in the *Uptime* app.
