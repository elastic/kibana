[[infra-cat]]
=== View your infrastructure by hosts or container

Select the high-level view: *Hosts*, *Kubernetes*, or *Docker*.
When you change views, you can see the same data through the perspective of a
different category.

[float]
[[infra-search]]
=== Use the power of Search

The Search bar is always available. You can use it to perform adhoc or structured searches.
The Search feature can surface the information you're looking for, even if the
other options you have selected would normally filter it out.

[float]
[[infra-metric]]
=== Start at a high-level by selecting the metric

This filter helps you start focusing on potential problem areas that may need
further investigation. You'll see metrics that are most relevant for hosts or
the container you selected.

[float]
[[infra-group]]
=== Group components 

The *Group By* selector offers grouping options that are native and specific for
your physical, virtual, and container-based infrastructure.
Examples include Availability Zone, Machine Type, Project ID, and Cloud Provider
for Hosts, and Namespace and Node for Kubernetes.

[float]
[[infra-date]]
=== Specify the date range

Use the time selector to focus on a specific timeframe.

[float]
[[infra-refresh]]
=== Auto-refresh or pause

Set auto-refresh to keep up-to-date information coming in, or stop
refreshing to focus on historical data without new distractions.

[float]
[[infra-configure-source]]
=== Adapt to your metric source

Using a custom index pattern to store the metrics, or want to limit the entries
presented in a space? Use configure source to change the index pattern and
other settings.
