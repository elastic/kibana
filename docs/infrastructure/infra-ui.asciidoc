== Using the Infrastructure UI

// +++ Gail provides this as an example of a good document. Leave it as is!

Use the Infrastructure UI in {kib} to monitor your infrastructure and identify
problems in real time. You can explore metrics for hosts, containers and services. You can also drill down to view more detailed metrics, or seamlessly switch to view the corresponding logs, application traces and uptime information for a component.

Initially, the *Inventory* tab shows an overview of the hosts in of your infrastructure and the current CPU usage for each host.
From here, you can drill down into areas of interest.

[float]
[[infra-cat]]
=== Choose the high-level view of your infrastructure

Select the high-level view from *Hosts*, *Kubernetes*, or *Docker*.
When you change views, you see the same data through the perspective of a different category.

If the view you select has a large number of components, you can hover over the component to see the the details for that component.

[float]
[[infra-metric]]
=== Select the metric to view

Select the metric to view from the *Metric* dropdown list.
The available metrics are those that are most relevant for the high level view you selected.

[float]
[[infra-group]]
=== Group components

Select the way you want to group the infrastructure components from the *Group By* dropdown list.
The available options are specific to your physical, virtual, or container-based infrastructure.
Examples of grouping options include Availability Zone, Machine Type, Project ID, and Cloud Provider for Hosts, and Namespace and Node for Kubernetes.

[float]
[[infra-search]]
=== Use the power of search

Use the search bar to perform ad hoc or structured searches using {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language] which features autocomplete and a simple, easy to use syntax.
For example, enter `host.hostname : "host1"` to see only the information for `host1`.

[float]
[[infra-date]]
=== Specify the time and date

Click the time selector to choose the timeframe for the metrics. The values shown are the values for the last minute at the specified time and date.

[float]
[[infra-refresh]]
=== Auto-refresh metrics

Select *Auto-refresh* to keep up-to-date metrics information coming in, or *Stop refreshing* to focus on historical data without new distractions.

[float]
[[infra-configure-source]]
=== Configure the data to use for your metrics

The deafult source configuration for metrics is specified in the {kibana-ref}/settings.html[Kibana configuration file].
The `metricbeat-*` index pattern is used to query the data and default field settings are also defined.

If your metrics have custom index patterns, or use non-default field settings for things like timestamps or container names, you can override the default settings.
Click *Configuration* to change the settings.
This opens the *Configure source* fly-out dialog.

NOTE: The settings here are shared with logs. Changes you make here also affect the settings used by the *Logs* tab.

In the *Configure source* dialog, you can change the following values:

* *Name*: the name of the source configuration.
* *Indices*: the index pattern or patterns in the Elasticsearch indices to read metrics data and log data
  from.
* *Fields*: the names of specific fields in the indices that need are used to query and interpret the data correctly.

TIP: If <<xpack-spaces>> are enabled in your Kibana instance, any configuration changes you make using Configure source are specific to the current space.
You can make different subsets of data available by creating multiple spaces with different data source configurations.

TIP: If you don't see the *Configuration* option, you may not have sufficient privileges to change the source configuration.
For more information on granting access to Kibana see <<xpack-security-authorization>>.

[[infra-drill-down]]
=== Drill down for related information

Hover over a component to see more information about that component.

Click a component to see the other actions available for that component.
You can select:

* *View Metrics* to <<xpack-view-metrics, view detailed metrics for the selected component>>.

* *View Logs* to <<xpack-logs-using, view the logs for the selected component>> in the *Logs* tab.

Depending on the features you have installed and configured, you may also be able to select:

* *View APM* to <<traces, view APM traces for the selected component>> in the *APM* tab.

* *View Uptime* to <<uptime-overview, view uptime information for the selected component>> in the *Uptime* tab.
