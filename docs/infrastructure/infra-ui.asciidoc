== Using the Infrastructure UI

// +++ Gail provides this as an example of a good document. Leave it as is!

Use the Infrastructure UI in {kib} to monitor your infrastructure and identify
problems in real time. You can explore metrics for hosts, containers and services. You can also drill down to view more detailed metrics, or seamlessly switch to view the corresponding logs, application traces and uptime information for a component.

Initially, the *Inventory* tab shows an overview the hosts in of your infrastructure and the current CPU usage for each host.
From here, you can drill down into areas of interest.

[float]
[[infra-cat]]
=== Choose the high-level view of your infrastructure

Select the high-level view from *Hosts*, *Kubernetes*, or *Docker*.
When you change views, you see the same data through the perspective of a different category.

[float]
[[infra-search]]
=== Use the power of Search

Use the Search bar to perform ad hoc or structured searches using {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language] which features autocomplete and a simple, easy to use syntax.
For example, enter `host.hostname : "host1"` to see only the information for `host1`.

[float]
[[infra-metric]]
=== Select the metric to view

Select the metric to view from the *Metric* dropdown list.
The available metrics are those that are most relevant for the high level view you selected.

[float]
[[infra-group]]
=== Group components

Select the way you want to group the infrastructure components from the *Group By* dropdown list.
The available options are specific to your physical, virtual, or container-based infrastructure.
Examples of grouping options include Availability Zone, Machine Type, Project ID, and Cloud Provider for Hosts, and Namespace and Node for Kubernetes.

[float]
[[infra-date]]
=== Specify the time and date range

Use the time selector to focus on a specific timeframe.

[float]
[[infra-refresh]]
=== Auto-refresh or pause

Select *Auto-refresh* to keep up-to-date metrics information coming in, or *Stop refreshing* to focus on historical data without new distractions.

[float]
[[infra-configure-source]]
=== Adapt to your metric source

Using a custom index pattern to store the metrics, or want to limit the entries
presented in a space? Use configure source to change the index pattern and
other settings.
// +++ more investigation needed here. Include info (currently in dumping ground topic) or add a link.  and what about the related logging features? Are the two configs identical or not?

[float]
[[infra-drill-down]]
=== Drill down for related information

Hover over a component to see more information about that component.

Click a component to see the other actions for that component that you can carry out from the Infrastructure tab.
You can select:

* *View Metrics* to {kibana-ref}/xpack-view-metrics.html[view detailed metrics for the selected component].

* *View Logs* to view the {kibana-ref}/xpack-logs-using.html[corresponding logs for the selected component] in the *Logs* tab.
// +++ I think this is the best link, but I may need to explain here that the tab opens with the appropriate component etc pre-selected.

Depending on the features you have installed and configured, you may also be able to select:

* *View APM* to {kibana-ref}/traces.html[view APM traces for the selected component] in the *APM* tab.
// +++ Comment as for Logs link

* *View Uptime* to {kibana-ref}/uptime-overview.html[view uptime information for the selected component] in the *Uptime* tab.
// +++ Comment as for logs link
