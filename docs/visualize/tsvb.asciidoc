[[TSVB]]
== TSVB

TSVB is a time series data visualizer that allows you to use the full power of the
Elasticsearch aggregation framework. With TSVB, you can combine an infinite
number of aggregations to display complex data.

NOTE: In Elasticsearch version 7.3.0 and later, the time series data visualizer is now referred to as TSVB instead of Time Series Visual Builder.
