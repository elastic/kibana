[[TSVB]]
== Visualizing your data with TSVB

TSVB is a time series data visualizer that allows you to use the full power of 
Elasticsearch aggregation framework. With TSVB, you can combine an infinite 
number of aggregations and pipeline aggregations to display complex data in a 
meaningful way.

NOTE: In Elasticsearch version 7.3.0 and later, the time series data visualizer is now referred to simply as TSVB instead of Time Series Visual Builder.

TSVB comes with 6 visualizations:

Time Series::
A histogram visualization that supports area, line, bar, and steps along with 
multiple y-axis.

Metric::
Displays the latest number in a series.

Top N::
A horizontal bar chart where the y-axis is based on a series of metrics, and the x-axis is the latest value in the series.

Gauge::
A single value gauge visualization based on the latest value in a series.

Markdown::
To customize the Markdown with data based on a set of series, enter Markdown text and embed Mustache template syntax.

Table::
Display data from multiple time series by defining the field group to show in 
the rows, and the columns of data to display.

==== Create a Time Series visualization

Display your data over time with area, line, and bar charts.

. Select *Time Series*.

. To specify the series labels and customize the colors, points, line thickness, and fill opacity, select *Data*.
+
For series that are grouped by a term, you can specify a mustache variable of `{{key}}` to substitute the term.

.. Select *Metrics*, then specify the options.
+
Each series supports multiple metrics (aggregations); the last metric (aggregation)
is the value that will be displayed for the series, this is indicated with the "eye"
icon to the left of the metric. Metrics can be composed using pipeline aggregations.
A common use case is to create a metric with a "max" aggregation then create a "derivative"
metric and choose the previous "max" metric as the source; this will create a rate.

.. Select *Options*, then specify the series options for your Time Series visualization.

.. To specify how the series should be grouped or split, select an option from the *Group by* drop-down list.

. To compare two time periods by using time shifting...

. To configure the panel, select *Panel options*.

. To add annotations that are loaded from a separate index based on a query, select *Annotations*.

==== Create a Metric visualization

With the Metric visualization, you can use a primary and secondary metric, and customize the labels and backgrounds based on a set of rules.

. Select *Metric*.

. To specify the series labels and colors that you want to represent your data, select *Data*.

For series that are grouped by a term, you can specify a mustache variable of `{{key}}` to substitute the term.

[[top-n-visualization]]
==== Create a Top N visualization

The values are displayed in descending order, and you can customize the color of the bars based on a set of rules.

. Select *Top N*.

[[gauge-visualization]]
==== Create a Gauge visualization

The face of the gauge displays as a half-circle or full-circle. You can customize the thicknesses of the inner and outer lines to achieve a desired design aesthetic, and customize the gauge and text color based on a set of rules.
 
. Select *Gauge*.

customize the Markdown with data based on a set of series

. Select *Markdown*.

==== Create a Table visualization

Display data from multiple time series

. Select *Table*.
