[[TSVB]]
== Visualizing your data with TSVB

TSVB is a time series data visualizer that allows you to use the full power of the 
Elasticsearch aggregation framework. With TSVB, combine an infinite 
number of aggregations and pipeline aggregations to display complex data in a 
meaningful way.

NOTE: In Elasticsearch version 7.3.0 and later, the time series data visualizer is now referred to simply as TSVB instead of Time Series Visual Builder.

TSVB comes with 6 types of visualizations:

* *Time Series* — A histogram visualization that supports area, line, bar, and steps along with multiple y-axis.

* *Metric* — Displays the latest number in a data series.

* *Top N* — A horizontal bar chart where the y-axis is based on a series of metrics, and the x-axis is the latest value in the series.

* *Gauge* — A single value gauge visualization based on the latest value in a series.

* *Markdown* — To customize the Markdown with data based on a set of series, enter Markdown text and embed Mustache template syntax.

* *Table* — Display data from multiple time series by defining the field group to show in the rows, and the columns of data to display.
