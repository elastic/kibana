[[TSVB]]
== TSVB

TSVB is a time series data visualizer that allows you to use the full power of the 
Elasticsearch aggregation framework. With TSVB, you can combine an infinite 
number of aggregations to display complex data.

NOTE: In Elasticsearch version 7.3.0 and later, the time series data visualizer is now referred to as TSVB instead of Time Series Visual Builder.

+ 
If you are using the *Table* visualization, select *Columns*.

.. In the *Label* field, enter a name for the data series, which is used on legends and titles.
+
For series that are grouped by a term, you can specify a mustache variable of `{{key}}` to substitute the term.
