Lens comes with these types of visualizations:

Bar:: Display numerical comparisons across multiple categories. In bar charts,
data is displayed using a number of bars that represent a particular category.

Stacked Bar:: Display numerical comparisons across multiple categories, with the
added ability to compare the different parts of a particular category. In
stacked bar charts, each bar represents a particular category, and the segments
of the bar represent the subcategories of that bar.
