*Lens* is a simple and fast way to create visualizations of your {es} data. To create visualizations, 
you drag and drop your data fields onto the visualization builder pane, and *Lens* automatically generates 
a visualization that best displays your data.

With Lens, you can:

* Use the automatically generated visualization suggestions to change the visualization type.

* Create visualizations with multiple layers and indices.

* Add your visualizations to dashboards and Canvas workpads.

To get started with *Lens*, select a field in the data panel, then drag and drop the field on a highlighted area.

You can incorporate many fields into your visualization, and Lens uses heuristics to decide how to apply each one to the visualization.

TIP: Drag-and-drop capabilities are available only when Lens knows how to use the data. If *Lens* is unable to automatically generate a visualization,
you can still configure the customization options for your visualization.

==== Change the data panel fields

The fields in the data panel are based on the selected <<index-patterns, index pattern>> and <<set-time-filter,time filter>>. 

To change the index pattern, click it, then select a new one. The fields in the data panel automatically update.

To filter the fields in the data panel:

* Enter the name in *Search field names*.

* Click *Filter by type*, then select the filter. To show all of the fields in the index pattern, deselect *Only show fields with data*.

[[view-data-summaries]]
==== Data summaries

To help you decide exactly the data you want to display, get a quick summary of each field. The summary shows the distribution of values within the selected time range.

To view the field summary information, navigate to the field, then click *i*.

When there is an exclamation point (!)
next to a visualization type, Lens is unable to transfer your data, but
still allows you to make the change.
