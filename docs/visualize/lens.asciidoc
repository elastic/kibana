== Lens

beta[]

*Lens* provides you with a simple and fast way to create visualizations from your {es} data. With Lens, you can:

* Quickly build visualizations by dragging and dropping data fields.

* Understand your data with a summary view on each field.

* Easily change the visualization type by selecting the automatically generated visualization suggestions.

* Save your visualization for use in a dashboard.

[[drag-drop]]
=== Drag and drop

The panel shows the data fields for the selected time period. When
you drag a field from the data panel, Lens highlights where you can drop that field. The first time you drag a data field,
you'll see two places highlighted in green:

* The visualization builder pane

* The *X-axis* or *Y-axis* fields

You can incorporate many fields into your visualization, and Lens uses heuristics to decide how
to apply each one to the visualization.

TIP: Drag-and-drop capabilities are available only when Lens knows how to use the data. You can still customize
your visualization if Lens is unable to make a suggestion.

[[apply-lens-filters]]
==== Find the right data

Lens shows you fields based on the <<index-patterns, index patterns>> you have defined in
{kib}, and the current time range. When you change the index pattern or time filter,
the list of fields are updated.

To narrow the list of fields, you can:

* Enter the field name in *Search field names*.

* Click *Filter by type*, then select the filter. You can also select *Only show fields with data*
to show the full list of fields from the index pattern.

[float]
[[view-data-summaries]]
==== Data summaries

To help you decide exactly the data you want to display, get a quick summary of each data field.
The summary shows the distribution of values in the time range.

To view the data information, navigate to a data field, then click *i*.

[[change-the-visualization-type]]
==== Change the visualization type

With Lens, you are no longer required to build each visualization from scratch. Lens allows
you to switch between any supported chart type at any time. Lens also provides
suggestions, which are shortcuts to alternate visualizations based on the data you have.

You can switch between suggestions without losing your previous state:

If you want to switch to a chart type that is not suggested, click the chart type,
then select a chart type. When there is an exclamation point (!)
next to a chart type, Lens is unable to transfer your current data, but
still allows you to make the change.

[float]
[[customize-operation]]
==== Customize the data for your visualization

Lens allows some customizations of the data for each visualization.

. Click the index pattern name, then select the new index pattern.
+
If there is a match, Lens displays the new data. All fields that do not match the index pattern are removed.

. Change the data field options, such as the aggregation or label.

.. Click *Drop a field here* or the field name in the column.

.. Change the options that appear depending on the type of field.

[float]
[[layers]]
==== Layers in bar, line, and area charts

The bar, line, and area charts allow you to layer two different series. To add a layer, click *+*.

To remove a layer, click the chart icon next to the index name:

[[lens-tutorial]]
=== Lens tutorial

Ready to create your own visualization with Lens? Use the following tutorial to create a visualization that
lets you compare sales over time.

[float]
[[lens-before-begin]]
==== Before you begin

To start, you'll need to add the <<add-sample-data, sample ecommerce data>>.

[float]
==== Build the visualization

Drag and drop your data onto the visualization builder pane.

. Open *Visualize*, then click *Create visualization*.

. On the *New Visualization* window, click *Lens*.

. Select the *kibana_sample_data_ecommerce* index.

. Click image:images/time-filter-calendar.png[], then click *Last 7 days*. The list of data fields are updated.

. Drag and drop the *taxful_total_price* data field to the visualization builder pane.
+

Lens has taken your intent to see *taxful_total_price* and added in the *order_date* field to show
average order prices over time.

To break down your data, drag the *category.keyword* field to the visualization builder pane. Lens
understands that you want to show the top categories and compare them across the dates,
and creates a chart that compares the sales for each of the top 3 categories:

[[customize-lens-visualization]]
==== Further customization

Customize your visualization to look exactly how you want.

. Click *Average of taxful_total_price*.

.. Change the *Label* to `Sales`, or a name that you prefer for the data.

. Click *Top values of category.keyword*.

.. Increase *Number of values* to `10`. The visualization updates in the background to show there are only
six available categories.

. Look at the suggestions. None of them show an area chart, but for sales data, a stacked area chart
might make sense. To switch the chart type:

.. Click *Stacked bar chart* in the column.

.. Click *Stacked area*.
