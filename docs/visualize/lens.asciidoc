*Lens* is a simple and fast way to create visualizations of your {es} data. With *Lens*, 
you drag and drop your data fields onto the visualization builder pane, and *Lens* automatically generates 
a visualization that best displays your data.

With Lens, you can:

* Explore your data in just a few clicks.

* Create visualizations with multiple layers and indices.

* Use the automatically generated visualization suggestions to change the visualization type.

* Add your visualizations to dashboards and Canvas workpads.

To get started with *Lens*, click a field in the data panel, then drag and drop the field on a highlighted area.

You can incorporate many fields into your visualization, and Lens uses heuristics to decide how to apply each one to the visualization.

TIP: Drag-and-drop capabilities are available only when Lens knows how to use the data. If *Lens* is unable to automatically generate a visualization,
you can still configure the customization options for your visualization.

To change the index pattern, click it, then select a new one. The fields in the data panel automatically update.

To filter the fields in the data panel:

* Enter the name in *Search field names*.

* Click *Filter by type*, then select the filter. To show all of the fields in the index pattern, deselect *Only show fields with data*.

To view the field summary information, navigate to the field, then click *i*.

When there is an exclamation point (!)
next to a visualization type, Lens is unable to transfer your data, but
still allows you to make the change.

==== Change the aggregation and labels

Lens allows some customizations of the data for each visualization.

. Click *Drop a field here* or the field name in the column.

. Change the options that appear depending on the type of field.

[[layers]]
==== Add layers and indices

Bar, line, and area charts allow you to visualize multiple data layers and indices so that you can compare and analyze data from multiple sources.

To add a layer, click *+*, then drag and drop the fields for the new layer. To view a different index, click it, then select a new one.
