== Markdown Widget

The Markdown widget is a text entry field that accepts GitHub-flavored Markdown text. Kibana renders the text you enter
in this field and displays the results on the dashboard. You can click the *Help* link to go to the
https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/[help page] for GitHub flavored Markdown. Click *Apply* to
display the rendered text in the Preview pane or *Discard* to revert to a previous version.
