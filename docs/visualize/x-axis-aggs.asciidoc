The X axis of this chart is the _buckets_ axis. You can define buckets for the X axis, for a split area on the
chart, or for split charts.

This chart's X axis supports the following aggregations. Click the linked name of each aggregation to visit the main
Elasticsearch documentation for that aggregation.

*Date Histogram*:: A {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html[_date histogram_] is built from a
numeric field and organized by date. You can specify a time frame for the intervals in seconds, minutes, hours, days,
weeks, months, or years. You can also specify a custom interval frame by selecting *Custom* as the interval and
specifying a number and a time unit in the text field. Custom interval time units are *s* for seconds, *m* for minutes,
*h* for hours, *d* for days, *w* for weeks, and *y* for years. Different units support different levels of precision,
down to one second.

*Histogram*:: A standard {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-histogram-aggregation.html[_histogram_] is built from a
numeric field. Specify an integer interval for this field. Select the *Show empty buckets* checkbox to include empty
intervals in the histogram.
*Range*:: With a {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-range-aggregation.html[_range_] aggregation, you can specify ranges
of values for a numeric field. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints. Click the red *(x)* symbol to remove
a range.
*Date Range*:: A {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-daterange-aggregation.html[_date range_] aggregation reports values
that are within a range of dates that you specify. You can specify the ranges for the dates using
{ref}/common-options.html#date-math[_date math_] expressions. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints.
Click the red *(x)* symbol to remove a range.
*IPv4 Range*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-iprange-aggregation.html[_IPv4 range_] aggregation enables you to
specify ranges of IPv4 addresses. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints. Click the red *(x)* symbol to
remove a range.
*Terms*:: A {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[_terms_] aggregation enables you to specify the top
or bottom _n_ elements of a  given field to display, ordered by count or a custom metric.
*Filters*:: You can specify a set of {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-filters-aggregation.html[_filters_] for the data.
You can specify a filter as a query string or in JSON format, just as in the Discover search bar. Click *Add Filter* to
add another filter. Click the image:images/labelbutton.png[Label button icon] *label* button to open the label field, where
you can type in a name to display on the visualization.
*Significant Terms*:: Displays the results of the experimental
{ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html[_significant terms_] aggregation.

Once you've specified an X axis aggregation, you can define sub-aggregations to refine the visualization. Click *+ Add
Sub Aggregation* to define a sub-aggregation, then choose *Split Area* or *Split Chart*, then select a sub-aggregation
from the list of types.

When multiple aggregations are defined on a chart's axis, you can use the up or down arrows to the right of the
aggregation's type to change the aggregation's priority.

Enter a string in the *Custom Label* field to change the display label.
