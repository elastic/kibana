== Most frequently used visualizations

The most frequently used visualizations allow you to plot aggregated data from a <<save-open-search, saved search>> or <<index-patterns, index pattern>>. They all support a single level of
Elasticsearch {es} {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics.html[metric] aggregations, and one or more
levels of {es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket.html[bucket] aggregations.

The most frequently used visualizations include:

* Line, area, and bar charts
* Pie charts
* Data tables
* Metric, goals, and gauges
* Heat maps
* Tag clouds

=== Configure your visualization

You configure visualizations using the default editor, which is broken into metrics and buckets, and includes a default count
metric. Each visualization supports different configurations for what the metrics and buckets
represent. For example, a bar chart allows you to add an X-axis:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-bucket.png["",height=478]

A common configuration for the X-axis is to use a {es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html[date histogram] aggregation:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-date-histogram.png[]

To see your changes, click *Apply changes* image:images/apply-changes-button.png[]

If it's supported by the visualization, you can add more buckets. In this example we have
added a
{es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[terms] aggregation on the field
`geo.src` to show the top 5 sources of log traffic.

image::images/visualize-date-histogram-split-1.png[]

The new aggregation is added after the first one, so the result shows
the top 5 sources of traffic per 3 hours. If you want to change the aggregation order, you can do
so by dragging:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-drag-reorder.png["",width=366]

The visualization
now shows the top 5 sources of traffic overall, and compares them in 3 hour increments:

image::images/visualize-date-histogram-split-2.png[]

For more information about how aggregations are used in visualizations, see <<supported-aggregations, supported aggregations>>.

Each visualization also has its own customization options. Most visualizations allow you to customize the color of a specific series:
