=== Supported aggregations

Basic visualizations support the following aggregations:

* <<visualize-metric-aggregations,Metric>>

* <<visualize-parent-pipeline-aggregations,Parent pipeline>>

* <<visualize-sibling-pipeline-aggregations,Sibling pipeline>>

* <<visualize-bucket-aggregations,Bucket>>

=== Configure your visualization

To configure basic visualizations, use the default editor. Each visualization supports different configurations of metric and bucket aggregations.

For example, a bar chart allows you to add an x-axis:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-bucket.png["",height=478]

A common configuration for the x-axis is to use a {es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html[date histogram] aggregation:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-date-histogram.png[]

To see your changes, click *Apply changes* image:images/apply-changes-button.png[]

If supported by the visualization, you can add more buckets. In this example, the
{es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[terms] aggregation is added on the `geo.src` field
to show the top five sources of log traffic.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-date-histogram-split-1.png[]

{kib} adds the aggregation after the first one, so the result shows
the top five sources of traffic for every three hours. To change the aggregation order, drag the aggregation:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-drag-reorder.png["",width=366]

The visualization shows the top five sources of traffic overall, and compares them in three hour increments:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-date-histogram-split-2.png[]

For more information about aggregations, refer to <<supported-aggregations, supported aggregations>>.

Each visualization has its own customization options. Most visualizations allow you to customize the color of a specific series:
