== Most frequently used visualizations

These are:

* Line, Area and Bar charts
* Pie charts
* Data table
* Metric visualization
* Goal and Gauge visualization
* Heat maps
* Tag cloud

These visualizations allow you to plot aggregated data from a <<save-open-search, saved search>> or <<index-patterns, index pattern>>. They all support a single level of 
Elasticsearch {es} {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics.html[metric] aggregations, and one or more
levels of {es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket.html[bucket] aggregations.

=== Configuring your visualization

Once you have selected a visualization and data source, you will see the default editor.
This editor is broken into *Metrics* and *Buckets*, and includes a default count
metric. Each visualization supports different configurations for what the metrics and buckets
represent. For example, a Bar chart would allow you to add an X axis:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-bucket.png["",height=478]

A common configuration for the X axis is to use a {es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html[date histogram] aggregation:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-date-histogram.png[]

After adding a metric or bucket, you will need to *Apply changes* image:images/apply-changes-button.png[]

If it's supported by the visualization, you can add more buckets. In this example we have
added a 
{es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[terms] aggregation on the field
`geo.src` to show the top 5 sources of log traffic.

image::images/visualize-date-histogram-split-1.png[]

As you can see in the image above, the new aggregation was added after the first one, so the result show
the top 5 sources of traffic per 3 hours. If you want to change the aggregation order, you can do
so by dragging:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-drag-reorder.png["",width=366]

After dragging the terms aggregation to the top of the buckets panel, you see that the visualization
now shows the top 5 sources of traffic overall, and compares them in 3 hour increments:

Each visualization also has its own customization options documented in the following pages.
Most of these visualizations allow you to customize the color of a specific series:
