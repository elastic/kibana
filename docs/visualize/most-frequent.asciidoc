== Most frequently used visualizations

The most frequently used visualizations allow you to plot aggregated data from a <<save-open-search, saved search>> or <<index-patterns, index pattern>>.

The most frequently used visualizations include:

* Line, area, and bar charts
* Pie chart
* Data table
* Metric, goal, and gauge
* Tag cloud

=== Supported aggregations

The most frequently used visualizations support the following aggregations:

* <<visualize-metric-aggregations,Metric>>

* <<visualize-parent-pipeline-aggregations,Parent pipeline>>

* <<visualize-sibling-pipeline-aggregations,Sibling pipeline>>

* <<visualize-bucket-aggregations,Bucket>>

=== Configure your visualization

You configure visualizations using the default editor. Each visualization supports different configurations of the metrics and buckets.

For example, a bar chart allows you to add an x-axis:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-bucket.png["",height=478]

A common configuration for the x-axis is to use a {es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html[date histogram] aggregation:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-date-histogram.png[]

To see your changes, click *Apply changes* image:images/apply-changes-button.png[]

If it's supported by the visualization, you can add more buckets. In this example we have
added a
{es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[terms] aggregation on the field
`geo.src` to show the top 5 sources of log traffic.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-date-histogram-split-1.png[]

The new aggregation is added after the first one, so the result shows
the top 5 sources of traffic per 3 hours. If you want to change the aggregation order, you can do
so by dragging:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-drag-reorder.png["",width=366]

The visualization
now shows the top 5 sources of traffic overall, and compares them in 3 hour increments:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-date-histogram-split-2.png[]

For more information about how aggregations are used in visualizations, see <<supported-aggregations, supported aggregations>>.

Each visualization also has its own customization options. Most visualizations allow you to customize the color of a specific series:
