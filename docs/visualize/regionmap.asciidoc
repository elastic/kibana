== Region Maps

Region maps are thematic maps in which boundary vector shapes are colored using a gradient: 
higher intensity colors indicate larger values, and lower intensity colors indicate smaller values. 
These are also known as choropleth maps.

=== Configuration

To create a region map, you configure an inner join that joins the result of an Elasticsearch terms aggregation 
and a reference vector file based on a shared key.

==== Data

===== Metrics

Select any of the supported _Metric_ or _Sibling Pipeline Aggregations_.

===== Buckets 

Configure a _Terms_ aggregation. The term is the _key_ that is used to join the results to the vector data on the map.

==== Options

===== Layer Settings
- *Vector map*: select from a list of vector maps. This list includes the maps that are hosted by the © [Elastic Maps Service](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-maps-service),
as well as your self-hosted layers that are configured in the *config/kibana.yml* file. To learn more about how to configure Kibana
to make self-hosted layers available, see the <<regionmap-settings,regionmap settings>> documentation.
- *Join field*: this is the property from the selected vector map that will be used to join on the terms in your terms-aggregation.

===== Style Settings
- *Color Schema*: the color range used to color the shapes.

===== Basic Settings
- *Legend Position*: the location on the screen where the legend should be rendered.
- *Show Tooltip*: indicates whether a tooltip should be displayed when hovering over a shape..
