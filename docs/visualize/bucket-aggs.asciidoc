*Date Histogram*:: A {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html[_date histogram_] splits a date field into buckets by interval. If the date field is the primary time field for the index pattern, it will pick an automatic interval for you. You can also choose a minimum time interval. You can also specify a custom interval frame by selecting *Custom* as the interval and
specifying a number and a time unit in the text field. Custom interval time units are *s* for seconds, *m* for minutes,
*h* for hours, *d* for days, *w* for weeks, and *y* for years. Different units support different levels of precision,
down to one millisecond. Intervals are labeled at the start of the interval, using the date-key returned by Elasticsearch. 
For example, the tooltip for a monthly interval will show the first day of the month.

*Histogram*:: A standard {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-histogram-aggregation.html[_histogram_] is built from a
numeric field. Specify an integer interval for this field. Select the *Show empty buckets* checkbox to include empty
intervals in the histogram.
*Range*:: With a {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-range-aggregation.html[_range_] aggregation, you can specify ranges
of values for a numeric field. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints. Click the red *(x)* symbol to remove
a range.
*Date Range*:: A {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-daterange-aggregation.html[_date range_] aggregation reports values
that are within a range of dates that you specify. You can specify the ranges for the dates using
{ref}/common-options.html#date-math[_date math_] expressions. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints.
Click the red *(x)* symbol to remove a range.
*IPv4 Range*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-iprange-aggregation.html[_IPv4 range_] aggregation enables you to
specify ranges of IPv4 addresses. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints. Click the red *(x)* symbol to
remove a range.
*Terms*:: A {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[_terms_] aggregation enables you to specify the top
or bottom _n_ elements of a  given field to display, ordered by count or a custom metric.
*Filters*:: Each filter creates a bucket of documents. You can specify a filter as a
<<kuery-query, KQL>> or <<lucene-query, Lucene>> query string. Click *Add Filter* to
add another filter. Click the image:images/labelbutton.png[Label button icon] *label* button to open the label field, where
you can type in a name to display on the visualization.
*Significant Terms*:: An aggregation that returns interesting or unusual occurrences of terms in a set. Uses the 
{ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html[Significant terms] aggregation.
