*JSON Input*:: A text field where you can add specific JSON-formatted properties to merge with the aggregation
definition, as in the following example:

[source,shell]
{ "script" : "doc['grade'].value * 1.2" }

This example implements a {es} {ref}/search-aggregations.html[Script Value Source] which replaces
the value in the metric. The availability of these options varies depending on the aggregation
you choose.
