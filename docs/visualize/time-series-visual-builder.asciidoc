== Time Series Visual Builder

*Experimental Feature*

Time Series Visual Builder is a time series data visualizer with an emphasis
on allowing you to use the full power of Elasticsearch aggregation framework.
Time Series Visual Builder allows you to combine an infinite number of
aggregations and pipeline aggregations to display complex data in a meaningful way.

=== Featured Visualizations

Time Series Visual Build comes with 5 different visualization types. You can
switch between each visualization type using the tabbed picker at the top of the
interface.


==== Time Series

A histogram visualization that supports area, line, bar, and steps along with
multiple y-axis. You can fully customize the colors, points, line thickness
and fill opacity. This visualization also supports time shifting to compare two
time periods. This visualization also supports annotations which can be loaded from
a seperate index based on a query.

==== Metric

A visualization for displaying the latest number in a series. This visualization
supports 2 metrics; a primary metric and a secondary metric. The labels and
backgrounds can be fully customizable based on a set of rules.

==== Top N

This is a horizontal bar chart where the y-axis is based on a series of metrics
and the x-axis is the latest value in those series; sorted in descending order.
The color of the bars are fully customizable based on set of rules.

==== Gauge

This is a single value gauge visualization based on the latest value in a series.
The face of the gauge can either be a half-circle gauge or full-circle. You
can customize the thicknesses of the inner and outer lines to achieve a desired
design aesthetic. The color of the gauge and the text are fully customizable based
on a set of rules.

==== Markdown

This visualization allows you to enter Markdown text and embed Mustache
template syntax to customize the Markdown with data based on a set of series.
This visualization also supports HTML markup along with the ability to define
a custom stylesheet.

=== Interface Overview

The user interface for each visualization is compose of a "Data" tab and "Panel
Options". The only exception to that is the Time Series and Markdown visualizations;
the Time Series has a third tab for annotations and the Markdown has a third tab for
the editor.

==== Data Tab

The data tab is used for configuring the series for each visualization. This tab
allows you to add multiple series, depending on what the visualization
supports, with multiple aggregations composed together to create a single metric.
Here is a breakdown of the significant components of the data tab UI.

===== Series Label and Color

Each series supports a label which will be used for legends and titles depending on
which visualization type is selected. For series that are grouped by a term, you
can specify a mustache variable of `{{key}}` to substitute the term. For most
visualizations you can also choose a color by clicking on the swatch, this will display
the color picker.

===== Metrics

Each series supports multiple metrics (aggregations); the last metric (aggregation)
is the value that will be displayed for the series, this is indicated with the "eye"
icon to the left of the metric. Metrics can be composed using pipeline aggregations.
A common use case is to create a metric with a "max" aggregation then create a "derivative"
metric and choose the previous "max" metric as the source; this will create a rate.

===== Series Options

Each series also supports a set of options which are dependent on the type of
visualizations you have selected. Universal across each visualization type
you can configure:

* Data format
* Time range offset
* Index pattern, timestamp, and interval override

For the Time Series visualization you can also configure:

* Chart type
* Options for each chart type
* Legend Visibility
* Y-Axis options
* Split color theme

===== Group By Controls

At the bottom of the metrics there is a set of "Group By" controls that allows you
to specify how the series should be grouped or split. There are four choices:

* Everything
* Filter (single)
* Filters (multiple with configurable colors)
* Terms

By default the series is grouped by everything.

==== Panel Options Tab

The panel options tab is used for configuring the entire panel; the set of options
available is dependent on which visualization you have selected. Below is a list
of the options available per visualization:

*Time Series*

* Index pattern, timestamp, and Interval
* Y-Axis min and max
* Y-Axis position
* Background color
* Legend visibility
* Legend position
* Panel filter

*Metric*

* Index pattern, timestamp, and interval
* Panel filter
* Color rules for background and primary value

*Top N*

* Index pattern, timestamp, and interval
* Panel filter
* Background color
* Item URL
* Color rules for bar colors

*Gauge*

* Index pattern, timestamp, and interval
* Panel filter
* Background color
* Gauge max
* Gauge style
* Inner gauge color
* Inner gauge width
* Gauge line width
* Color rules for gauge line

*Markdown*

* Index pattern, timestamp, and interval
* Panel filter
* Background color
* Scroll bar visibility
* Vertical alignment of content
* Custom Panel CSS with support for Less syntax

==== Annotations Tab

The annotations tab is used for adding annotation data sources to the Time Series
Visualization. You can configure the following options:

* Index pattern and time field
* Annotation color
* Annotation icon
* Fields to include in message
* Format of message
* Filtering options at the panel and global level

==== Markdown Tab

The markdown tab is used for editing the source for the Markdown visualization.
The user interface has an editor on the left side and the available variables from
the data tab on the right side. You can click on the variable names to insert
the mustache template variable into the markdown at the cursor position. The mustache
syntax uses the Handlebar.js processor which is an extended version of the Mustache
template language.
