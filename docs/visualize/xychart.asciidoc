=== Line, Area, and Bar charts

Charts are expected to contain a single X axis, but you can split charts into multiple smaller Line, Area, or Bar
charts using the Split Charts feature.

You can click the *Advanced* link to display more customization options for your metrics or bucket aggregation:

*Exclude Pattern*:: Specify a pattern in this field to exclude from the results.
*Include Pattern*:: Specify a pattern in this field to include in the results.

[[metrics-axes]]
==== Metrics & Axes

Select the *Metrics & Axes* tab to change the way each individual metric is shown on the chart.
The data series are styled in the _Metrics_ section, while the axes are styled in the X and Y axis sections.

[float]
===== Metrics
Modify how each metric from the Data panel is visualized on the chart.

*Chart type*:: Choose between *Area*, *Line*, and *Bar* types.
*Mode*:: stack the different metrics, or plot them next to each other
*Value Axis*:: choose the axis you want to plot this data too (the properties of each are configured under Y-axes).
*Line mode*:: should the outline of lines or bars appear *smooth*, *straight*, or *stepped*.

[float]
===== Y-axis

Style all the Y-axes of the chart.

*Position*:: position of the Y-axis (*left* or *right* for vertical charts, and *top* or *bottom* for horizontal charts).
*Scale type*:: scaling of the values (*linear*, *log*, or *square root*)
*Advanced Options*::
*Labels - Show Labels*:::: Allows you to hide axis labels
*Labels - Filter Labels*:::: If filter labels is enabled some labels will be hidden in case there is not enough space to display them
*Labels - Rotate*:::: You can enter the number in degrees for how much you want to rotate labels
*Labels - Truncate*:::: You can enter the size in pixels to which the label is truncated
*Scale to Data Bounds*:::: The default Y-axis bounds are zero and the maximum value returned in the data. Check
                           this box to change both upper and lower bounds to match the values returned in the data. 
                           Checking this option may cause that the bar, which value equals to the lower bounds/
                           upper bounds (in case only negative values are depicted) is hidden. 
                           To avoid that, you can define bounds margin. Via bounds margin you specify a value, 
                           which decreases/increases the lower/upper bounds when displaying the plot.
*Custom Extents*:::: You can define custom minimum and maximum for each axis

[float]
===== X-Axis

*Position*:: position of the X-Axis (*left* or *right* for horizontal charts, and *top* or *bottom* for vertical charts).
*Advanced Options*::
*Labels - Show Labels*:::: Allows you to hide axis labels
*Labels - Filter Labels*:::: If filter labels is enabled some labels will be hidden in case there is not enough spave to display them
*Labels - Rotate*:::: You can enter the number in degrees for how much you want to rotate labels
*Labels - Truncate*:::: You can enter the size in pixels to which the label is truncated

[[panel-settings]]
==== Panel Settings

These are options that apply to the entire chart and not just the individual data series.

[float]
===== Common options
*Legend Position*:: Move your legend to the *left*, *right*, *top* or *bottom*
*Show Tooltip*:: Enables or disables the display of tooltip on hovering over chart objects
*Current Time Marker*:: Show a line indicating the current time

[float]
===== Grid options
You can enable grid on the chart. By default grid is displayed on the category axis only.

*X-axis*:: You can disable the display of grid lines on category axis
*Y-axis*:: You can choose on which (if any) of the value axes you want to display grid lines
