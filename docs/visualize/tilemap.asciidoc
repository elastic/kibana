== Coordinate map

Coordinate maps display geographic areas overlaid with circles keyed to the data determined by the buckets you specify. To use coordinate maps, you plot latitude and longitude coordinates.

NOTE: Coordinate maps have been replaced with <<maps>>, which offers more functionality and is easier to use.

To create coordinate maps in Visualize:

* Set `xpack.maps.showMapVisualizationTypes` to `true`.

* To display map tiles, {kib} uses the https://www.elastic.co/elastic-maps-service[Elastic Maps Service].
To use other tile service providers, configure the <<tilemap-settings,tilemap settings>>
in `kibana.yml`.

[[coordinate-map-aggregation]]
=== Supported aggregations

Coordinate maps support the metric and bucket aggregations.

[float]
===== Metric aggregations

The following metric aggregations are supported:

{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-valuecount-aggregation.html[Count]:: Returns a raw count of
the elements in the index pattern. The default metrics aggregation for a coordinate map is *Count*.

{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-avg-aggregation.html[Average]:: Returns the average of a numeric
field.

{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-sum-aggregation.html[Sum]:: Returns the total sum of a numeric
field.

{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-min-aggregation.html[Min]:: Returns the minimum value of a
numeric field.

{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-max-aggregation.html[Max]:: Returns the maximum value of a
numeric field.

{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html[Unique Count]:: Returns
the number of unique values in a field.

[float]
[[coordinate-bucket-aggregation]]
===== Bucket aggregation

Coordinate maps support the {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.html[_geohash_] bucket aggregation.

When you deselect *Change precision on map zoom*, the *Precision* slider appears. The *Precision* slider determines the granularity of the results displayed on the map. For details on the area specified by each precision level, refer to {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.html#_cell_dimensions_at_the_equator[geohash grid].

NOTE: Higher precisions increase memory usage for the browser that displays {kib} and the underlying
{es} cluster.

When you select *Place markers off grid (use {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-geocentroid-aggregation.html[geocentroid])*, the markers are
placed in the center of all documents in the bucket, and a more accurate visualization is created.
NOTE: When you have multiple values in the geo_point, the coordinate map is unable to accurately calculate the geo_centroid.

When you deselect *Place markers off grid (use {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-geocentroid-aggregation.html[geocentroid])*, the markers are placed in the center
of the geohash grid cell.

[[navigate-map]]
=== Navigate the coordinate map

Use the following navigation options:

* To move the map center, click and hold anywhere on the map and move the cursor.
* To change the zoom level, click *Zoom In* or *Zoom out* image:images/viz-zoom.png[].
* To automatically crop the map boundaries to the
geohash buckets that have at least one result, click *Fit Data Bounds* image:images/viz-fit-bounds.png[].
