== Maps

To tell a story and answer questions about your geographical data, you can create several types of interactive maps with Visualize.

Visualize supports the following maps:

* *Coordinate* &mdash; Display latitude and longitude coordinates that are associated to the specified bucket aggregation.

* *Region* &mdash; Display colored boundary vector shapes using a gradient. Darker colors indicate larger values, and lighter colors indicate smaller values.

* *Heat* &mdash; Display graphical representations of data where the individual values are represented by colors.

NOTE: The maps in Visualize have been replaced with <<maps>>, which offers more functionality.

[[coordinate-map]]
=== Coordinate map

Use a coordinate map when your data set includes latitude and longitude values. For example, use a coordinate map to see the varying popularity of destination airports using the sample flight data.

==== Build a coordinate map

Configure the `kibana.yml` settings and add the aggregations.

. Configure the following `kibana.yml` settings:

* Set `xpack.maps.showMapVisualizationTypes` to `true`.

* To use a tile service provider for coordinate maps other than https://www.elastic.co/elastic-maps-service[Elastic Maps Service], configure the <<tilemap-settings,tilemap settings>>.

. To display your data on the coordinate map, use the following aggregations:

* <<visualize-metric-aggregations,Metric>>

* <<visualize-bucket-aggregations,Geohash bucket aggregation>>

. Specify the geohash bucket aggregation options:

* *Precision* slider &mdash; Determines the granularity of the results displayed on the map. To show the *Precision* slider, deselect *Change precision on map zoom*. For information on the area specified by each precision level, refer to {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.html#_cell_dimensions_at_the_equator[geohash grid].
+
NOTE: Higher precisions increase memory usage for the browser that displays {kib} and the underlying
{es} cluster.

* *Place markers off grid (use {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-geocentroid-aggregation.html[geocentroid])* &mdash; When you selected, the markers are
placed in the center of all documents in the bucket, and a more accurate visualization is created. When deselected, the markers are placed in the center
of the geohash grid cell.
+
NOTE: When you have multiple values in the geo_point, the coordinate map is unable to accurately calculate the geo_centroid.

==== Navigate the coordinate map

To navigate the coordinate map, use the navigation options.

* To move the map center, click and hold anywhere on the map and move the cursor.

* To change the zoom level, click *Zoom In* or *Zoom out* image:images/viz-zoom.png[].

* To automatically crop the map boundaries to the
geohash buckets that have at least one result, click *Fit Data Bounds* image:images/viz-fit-bounds.png[].

[float]
[[region-map]]
=== Region map

Use region maps when you want to show statistical data on a geographic area, such as a county, country, province, or state. For example, use a region map if you want to see the average sales for each country with the sample eCommerce order data.

[[build-region-maps]]
==== Build a region map

Configure the `kibana.yml` settings and add the aggregations.

. In `kibana.yml`, set `xpack.maps.showMapVisualizationTypes` to `true`.

. To display your data on the region map, use the following aggregations:

* <<visualize-metric-aggregations,Metric>>
* <<visualize-sibling-pipeline-aggregations,Sibling pipeline>>
* <<visualize-bucket-aggregations,Terms bucket aggregation>>

[float]
[[navigate-region-map]]
==== Navigate the region map

To navigate the region map, use the navigation options.

* To change the zoom level, click *Zoom In* or *Zoom out* image:images/viz-zoom.png[].

* To automatically crop the map boundaries, click *Fit Data Bounds* image:images/viz-fit-bounds.png[].

[float]
[[heat-map]]
=== Heat map

Use heat maps when your data set includes categorical data. For example, use a heat map to see the flights of origin countries compared to destination countries using the sample flight data.

[float]
[[build-heat-map]]
==== Build a heat map

To display your data on the heat map, use the supported aggregations.

Heat maps support the following aggregations:

* <<visualize-metric-aggregations,Metric>>
* <<visualize-parent-pipeline-aggregations,Parent pipeline>>
* <<visualize-sibling-pipeline-aggregations,Sibling pipeline>>
* <<visualize-bucket-aggregations,Bucket>>

[float]

==== Change the color ranges

When only one color displays on the heat map, you might need to change the color ranges.

To specify the number of color ranges:

. Click *Options*.

. Enter the *Number of colors* to display.

To specify custom ranges:

. Click *Options*.

. Select *Use custom ranges*.

. Enter the ranges to display.
