== Maps

To visualize and analyze your geographical data, Visualize provides you with several types of maps.

Visualize supports the following types of maps:

* Coordinate map - Displays geographic areas overlaid with circles keyed to the data determined by the buckets you specify. To use coordinate maps, you plot latitude and longitude coordinates.

* Region (Choropleth) map - Displays colored boundary vector shapes using a gradient. Darker colors indicate larger values, and lighter colors indicate smaller values.

* Heat map - Displays graphical representations of data where the individual values are represented as colors.

NOTE: Coordinate, region, and heat maps have been replaced with <<maps>>, which offers more functionality.

[[maps-supported-aggregations]]
=== Supported aggregations

Each map type supports a different set of aggregations.

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Map type
|Supported aggregations

|Coordinate
a|
* <<visualize-metric-aggregations,Metric>>
* <<visualize-bucket-aggregations,Geohash Bucket aggregation>>

|Region
a|
* <<visualize-metric-aggregations,Metric>>
* <<visualize-sibling-pipeline-aggregations,Sibling pipeline>>

To join the results to the vector data, use the _key_ term.

[[tilemap]]
=== Create coordinate maps

To create coordinate maps in Visualize:

* Set `xpack.maps.showMapVisualizationTypes` to `true`.

* To display map tiles, {kib} uses the https://www.elastic.co/elastic-maps-service[Elastic Maps Service].
To use other tile service providers, configure the <<tilemap-settings,tilemap settings>>
in `kibana.yml`.

When you deselect *Change precision on map zoom*, the *Precision* slider appears. The *Precision* slider determines the granularity of the results displayed on the map. For details on the area specified by each precision level, refer to {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.html#_cell_dimensions_at_the_equator[geohash grid].

NOTE: Higher precisions increase memory usage for the browser that displays {kib} and the underlying
{es} cluster.

When you select *Place markers off grid (use {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-geocentroid-aggregation.html[geocentroid])*, the markers are
placed in the center of all documents in the bucket, and a more accurate visualization is created.
NOTE: When you have multiple values in the geo_point, the coordinate map is unable to accurately calculate the geo_centroid.

When you deselect *Place markers off grid (use {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-geocentroid-aggregation.html[geocentroid])*, the markers are placed in the center
of the geohash grid cell.

[[navigate-map]]
==== Navigate the coordinate map

Use the following navigation options:

* To move the map center, click and hold anywhere on the map and move the cursor.
* To change the zoom level, click *Zoom In* or *Zoom out* image:images/viz-zoom.png[].
* To automatically crop the map boundaries to the
geohash buckets that have at least one result, click *Fit Data Bounds* image:images/viz-fit-bounds.png[].

[float]
[[region-map]]
=== Create region maps

Configure an inner join that joins the result of an {es} terms aggregation
and a reference vector file based on a shared key.

[[heat-map]]
=== Create heat maps

Something cool.

[float]
[[navigate-heatmap]]
=== Change the color ranges

When only one color displays on the heat map, you might need to change the color ranges.

To specify the number of color ranges:

. Click *Options*.

. Enter the *Number of colors* to display.

To specify custom ranges:

. Click *Options*.

. Select *Use custom ranges*.

. Enter the ranges to display.
