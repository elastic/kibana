== Coordinate Maps

A coordinate map displays a geographic area overlaid with circles keyed to the data determined by the buckets you specify.

NOTE: By default, Kibana uses the https://www.elastic.co/elastic-tile-service[Elastic Maps Service]
to display map tiles. To use other tile service providers, configure the <<tilemap-settings,tilemap settings>>
in `kibana.yml`.

=== Configuration

==== Data

===== Metrics

The default _metrics_ aggregation for a coordinate map is the *Count* aggregation. You can select any of the following
aggregations as the metrics aggregation:

*Count*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-valuecount-aggregation.html[_count_] aggregation returns a raw count of
the elements in the selected index pattern.
*Average*:: This aggregation returns the {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-avg-aggregation.html[_average_] of a numeric
field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Sum*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-sum-aggregation.html[_sum_] aggregation returns the total sum of a numeric
field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Min*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-min-aggregation.html[_min_] aggregation returns the minimum value of a
numeric field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Max*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-max-aggregation.html[_max_] aggregation returns the maximum value of a
numeric field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Unique Count*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html[_cardinality_] aggregation returns
the number of unique values in a field. Select a field from the drop-down.

Enter a string in the *Custom Label* field to change the display label.

===== Buckets

Coordinate maps use the {es-ref}search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.html[_geohash_] aggregation. Select a field, typically coordinates, from the
drop-down. 

- The_Change precision on map zoom_ box is checked by default. Uncheck the box to disable this behavior.
The _Precision_ slider determines the granularity of the results displayed on the map. See the documentation
for the {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.html#_cell_dimensions_at_the_equator[geohash grid]
aggregation for details on the area specified by each precision level.

NOTE: Higher precisions increase memory usage for the browser displaying Kibana as well as for the underlying
Elasticsearch cluster.

- The _place markers off grid (use {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-geocentroid-aggregation.html[geocentroid])_ box is checked by default. When this box is checked, the markers are
placed in the center of all the documents in that bucket. When unchecked, the markers are placed in the center
of the geohash grid cell. Leaving this checked generally results in a more accurate visualization.


Enter a string in the *Custom Label* field to change the display label.

You can click the *Advanced* link to display more customization options for your metrics or bucket aggregation:

*Exclude Pattern*:: Specify a pattern in this field to exclude from the results.
*Include Pattern*:: Specify a pattern in this field to include in the results.
*JSON Input*:: A text field where you can add specific JSON-formatted properties to merge with the aggregation
definition, as in the following example:

[source,shell]
{ "script" : "doc['grade'].value * 1.2" }

NOTE: In Elasticsearch releases 1.4.3 and later, this functionality requires you to enable
{ref}/modules-scripting.html[dynamic Groovy scripting].

The availability of these options varies depending on the aggregation you choose.

==== Options


*Map type*:: Select one of the following options from the drop-down.
*_Scaled Circle Markers_*:: Scale the size of the markers based on the metric aggregation's value.
*_Shaded Circle Markers_*:: Displays the markers with different shades based on the metric aggregation's value.
*_Shaded Geohash Grid_*:: Displays the rectangular cells of the geohash grid instead of circular markers, with different
shades based on the metric aggregation's value.
*_Heatmap_*:: A heat map applies blurring to the circle markers and applies shading based on the amount of overlap.
Heatmaps have the following options:

* *Radius*: Sets the size of the individual heatmap dots.
* *Blur*: Sets the amount of blurring for the heatmap dots.
* *Maximum zoom*: Tilemaps in Kibana support 18 zoom levels. This slider defines the maximum zoom level at which the
heatmap dots appear at full intensity.
* *Minimum opacity*: Sets the opacity cutoff for the dots.
* *Show Tooltip*: Check this box to have a tooltip with the values for a given dot when the cursor is on that dot.

*Desaturate map tiles*:: Desaturate the map's color in order to make the markers stand out more clearly.
*WMS compliant map server*:: Check this box to enable the use of a third-party mapping service that complies with the Web
Map Service (WMS) standard. Specify the following elements:

* *WMS url*: The URL for the WMS map service.
* *WMS layers*: A comma-separated list of the layers to use in this visualization. Each map server provides its own list of
layers.
* *WMS version*: The WMS version used by this map service.
* *WMS format*: The image format used by this map service. The two most common formats are `image/png` and `image/jpeg`.
* *WMS attribution*: An optional, user-defined string that identifies the map source. Maps display the attribution string
in the lower right corner.
* *WMS styles*: A comma-separated list of the styles to use in this visualization. Each map server provides its own styling
options.

After changing options, click the  *Apply changes* button to update your visualization, or the grey *Discard
changes* button to keep your visualization in its current state.

=== Navigating the Map

Once your tilemap visualization is ready, you can explore the map in several ways:

* Click and hold anywhere on the map and move the cursor to move the map center. Hold Shift and drag a bounding box
across the map to zoom in on the selection.
* Click the *Zoom In/Out* image:images/viz-zoom.png[] buttons to change the zoom level manually.
* Click the *Fit Data Bounds* image:images/viz-fit-bounds.png[] button to automatically crop the map boundaries to the
geohash buckets that have at least one result.
* Click the *Latitude/Longitude Filter* image:images/viz-lat-long-filter.png[] button, then drag a bounding box across the
map, to create a filter for the box coordinates.
