== Goal and Gauge

A goal visualization displays how your metric progresses toward a fixed goal. A gauge visualization displays in which 
predefined range falls your metric.

Open the *Advanced* link to display more customization options:

*JSON Input*:: A text field where you can add specific JSON-formatted properties to merge with the aggregation
definition, as in the following example:

[source,shell]
{ "script" : "doc['grade'].value * 1.2" }

NOTE: In Elasticsearch releases 1.4.3 and later, this functionality requires you to enable
{ref}/modules-scripting.html[dynamic Groovy scripting].

The availability of these options varies depending on the aggregation you choose.

Click the *Options* tab to change the following options:

- *Gauge Type* select between arc, circle and metric display type.
- *Percentage Mode* will show all values as percentages
- *Vertical Split* will put the gauges one under another instead of one next to another
- *Show Labels* selects whether you want to show or hide the labels
- *Sub Text* text for the label that appears below the value
- *Auto Extend Range* automatically grows the gauge if value is over its extents.
- *Ranges* you can add custom ranges. Each range will get assigned a color. If value falls within that range it will get
assigned that color. A chart with a single range is called a goal chart. A chart with multiple ranges is called a gauge
chart.
- *Color Options* define how to color your ranges (which color schema to use). Color options are only visible if more than
one range is defined.
- *Style - Show Scale* shows or hides the scale
- *Style - Color Labels* whether the labels should have the same color as the range where the value falls in
