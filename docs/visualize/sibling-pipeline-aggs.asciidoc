**Sibling Pipeline Aggregations:**

Just like with parent pipeline aggregations you need to provide a metric for which to calculate the sibling aggregation.
On top of that you also need to provide a bucket aggregation which will define the buckets on which the sibling
aggregation will run

*Average Bucket*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-avg-bucket-aggregation.html[_avg bucket_]
calculates the (mean) average value of a specified metric in a sibling aggregation
*Sum Bucket*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-avg-bucket-aggregation.html[_sum bucket_]
calculates the sum of values of a specified metric in a sibling aggregation
*Min Bucket*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-avg-bucket-aggregation.html[_min bucket_]
calculates the minimum value of a specified metric in a sibling aggregation
*Max Bucket*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-avg-bucket-aggregation.html[_max bucket_] 
calculates the maximum value of a specified metric in a sibling aggregation
