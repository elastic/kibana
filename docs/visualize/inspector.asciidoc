== Inspecting Visualizations

Many visualizations allow you to inspect the data behind the 
visualization. 

To inspect a visualization, click the *Inspect* button in the editor or 
select *Inspect* from the Dashboard panel menu.

The initial view shows the underlying data for the visualization. You can 
download the data as a comma separated values (CSV) file in 
*Formatted* or *Raw* format. Formatted downloads the data in table format.
Raw downloads the data as provided -- dates are timestamps, numbers donâ€™t have
thousand separators, and so on.

To view the requests that collected the data, select *Requests* from the *View* 
menu in the upper right.

Which views are available depends on the inspected visualization.
