== Inspector

Many visualizations have an Inspector that can help you gain insight to the data
behind the visualization.

To open the Inspector use the Inspector button while in the editor or select Inspector
from the Dashboard panel menu.

From the Inspector, you can download the visualization data as a comma separated
values (CSV) file in Formatted or Raw format. Formatted downloads the data in table format.
Raw downloads the data as provided -- dates are timestamps, numbers donâ€™t have
thousand separators, and so on.

To view the requests that collected the data, select Requests from the View menu in the upper right.

Which views are available depends on the inspected visualization.
