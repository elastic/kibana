Metric Aggregations:

*Count*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-valuecount-aggregation.html[_count_] aggregation returns a raw count of
the elements in the selected index pattern.
*Average*:: This aggregation returns the {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-avg-aggregation.html[_average_] of a numeric
field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Sum*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-sum-aggregation.html[_sum_] aggregation returns the total sum of a numeric
field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Min*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-min-aggregation.html[_min_] aggregation returns the minimum value of a
numeric field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Max*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-max-aggregation.html[_max_] aggregation returns the maximum value of a
numeric field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Unique Count*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html[_cardinality_] aggregation returns
the number of unique values in a field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Standard Deviation*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-extendedstats-aggregation.html[_extended stats_]
aggregation returns the standard deviation of data in a numeric field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Percentiles*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-percentile-aggregation.html[_percentile_] aggregation divides the
values in a numeric field into percentile bands that you specify. Select a field from the drop-down, then specify one
or more ranges in the *Percentiles* fields. Click the *X* to remove a percentile field. Click *+ Add* to add a
percentile field.
*Percentile Rank*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-percentile-rank-aggregation.html[_percentile ranks_]
aggregation returns the percentile rankings for the values in the numeric field you specify. Select a numeric field
from the drop-down, then specify one or more percentile rank values in the *Values* fields. Click the *X* to remove a
values field. Click *+Add* to add a values field.

Parent Pipeline Aggregations:

For each of the parent pipeline aggregations you have to define the metric for which the aggregation is calculated.
That could be one of your existing metrics or a new one. You can also nest this aggregations
(for example to produce 3rd derivative)

*Derivative*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-derivative-aggregation.html[_derivative_] aggregation calculates
the derivative of specific metrics.
*Cumulative Sum*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-cumulative-sum-aggregation.html[_cumulative sum_] aggregation
calculates the cumulative sum of a specified metric in a parent histogram
*Moving Average*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-movavg-aggregation.html[_moving average_] aggregation  will
slide a window across the data and emit the average value of that window
*Serial Diff*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-serialdiff-aggregation.html[_serial differencing_] is a technique
where values in a time series are subtracted from itself at different time lags or period

Sibling Pipeline Aggregations:

Just like with parent pipeline aggregations you need to provide a metric for which to calculate the sibling aggregation.
On top of that you also need to provide a bucket aggregation which will define the buckets on which the sibling
aggregation will run

*Average Bucket*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-avg-bucket-aggregation.html[_avg bucket_]
calculates the (mean) average value of a specified metric in a sibling aggregation
*Sum Bucket*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-avg-bucket-aggregation.html[_sum bucket_]
calculates the sum of values of a specified metric in a sibling aggregation
*Min Bucket*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-avg-bucket-aggregation.html[_min bucket_]
calculates the minimum value of a specified metric in a sibling aggregation
*Max Bucket*:: The {ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-avg-bucket-aggregation.html[_max bucket_] 
calculates the maximum value of a specified metric in a sibling aggregation

You can add an aggregation by clicking the *+ Add Metrics* button.

Enter a string in the *Custom Label* field to change the display label.
