The Controls widget enables you to add interactive inputs
on a dashboard.  You can create two types of inputs:

* Dropdown menu - Filters content when you select one or more options from a list. The dropdown menu is dynamically populated with the results of a terms aggregation.

* Radio slider -- Filter content within a range of numbers. The minimum and maximum values are dynamically populated with the results of a min and max aggregation.
