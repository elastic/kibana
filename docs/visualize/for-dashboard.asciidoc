=== Controls
experimental[]

The controls tool enables you to add interactive inputs
on a dashboard.

You can add two types of interactive inputs:

* *Options list* - Filters content based on one or more specified options. The dropdown menu is dynamically populated with the results of a terms aggregation. For example, use the options list on the sample flight dashboard when you want to filter the data by origin city and destination city.

* *Range slider* - Filters data within a specified range of numbers. The minimum and maximum values are dynamically populated with the results of a min and max aggregation. For example, use the range slider when you want to filter the sample flight dashboard by a specific average ticket price.

=== Markdown

The Markdown tool is a text entry field that accepts GitHub-flavored Markdown text. When you enter the text, the tool populates the results on the dashboard.

Markdown is helpful when you want to include important information, instructions, and images on your dashboard.

For information about GitHub-flavored Markdown text, click *Help*.

For example, when you enter:
