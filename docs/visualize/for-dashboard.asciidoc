The Controls widget enables you to add interactive inputs
on a dashboard.

You can create two types of controls:

* Range slider - Filters data within a specified range of numbers. The minimum and maximum values are dynamically populated with the results of a min and max aggregation.

* Options list - Filters content based on one or more specified options. The dropdown menu is dynamically populated with the results of a terms aggregation.

=== Markdown

The Markdown control is a text entry field that accepts GitHub-flavored Markdown text. When you enter your text, the control populates the results on the dashboard.

Markdown is helpful when you want to include important information or instructions on your dashboard. For example, when you enter:

`### Sample Flight data
This dashboard contains sample data for you to play with. You can view it, search it, and interact with the visualizations. For more information about Kibana, check our [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index).`
