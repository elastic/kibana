== Controls

Controls provide the ability to add interactive inputs to Kibana Dashboards.
Controls can be used to create two types of inputs; dropdowns and range sliders.

=== Configuration

==== Dropdown

The dropdown options lists are dynamically populated with the results of a terms aggregation.

==== Range slider

The range slider minimum and maximum values are dynamically populated with the results of a min and max aggregation.
