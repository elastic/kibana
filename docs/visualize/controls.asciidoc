== Controls Visualization

Controls provide the ability to add interactive inputs to Kibana Dashboards.
Controls can be used to create two types of inputs; dropdowns and range sliders.

=== Configuration
Create Controls visualizations by following the <<createvis,Creating a Visualization>> instructions.
Select *Controls* as the visualization type.

==== Dropdown

Dropdown inputs allow users to easily filter content by selecting options from a list.
The dropdown options list is dynamically populated with the results of a terms aggregation.

Add dropdown inputs to your Controls Visualization by selecting *Options list* and clicking *Add*.

*Control Label*:: By default, the control label will be the *Field*. Set this configuration to customize the control's label.
*Index Pattern*:: Specify the data set by selecting an <<index-patterns,Index Pattern>>.
*Field*:: Select the Field that will be used to populate the options list
and will be filtered on when users interact with the input.
The list of available fields is derived from the selected *Index Pattern* configuration.
*Parent control*:: Set parent control to chain dropdown inputs so that the selection of the first input
will filter the terms of the second input. Configuration is only available when multiple dropdowns have been created.
*Multiselect*:: When enabled, the dropdown will allow users to select multiple options.
*Size*:: Use the size parameter to define the number of options.

==== Range slider

Range sliders allow users to easily filter content by selecting a numerical range.
The range slider minimum and maximum values are dynamically populated with the results of a min and max aggregation.

Add range sliders to your Controls Visualization by selecting *Range slider* and clicking *Add*.

*Field*:: Select the Field that will be used to populate the slider range
and will be filtered on when users interact with the input.
The list of available fields is derived from the selected *Index Pattern* configuration.

*Update Kibana filters on each change*:: When enabled, all input interactions will immediately
create filters that will cause the dashboard to refresh. When disabled, Kibana filters will only be created
once *Apply changes* is clicked.
*Use time filter*:: When enabled, the aggregations used to generate the dropdown options list and
range minimum and maximum will be bound to <<set-time-filter,Kibana's global time range>>.
*Pin filters to global state*:: When enabled, all filters created by interacting with the inputs
will be automatically pinned.
