=== Uptime alerting

The Uptime app integrates with Kibana's {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[alerting and actions]
feature. It provides a set of built-in actions and Uptime specific threshold alerts for you to use
and enables central management of all alerts from {kibana-ref}/management.html[Kibana Management].

==== Monitor status alerts

To receive alerts when a monitor goes down, use the alerting menu at the top of the 
overview page. Use a query in the alert flyout to determine which monitors to check
with your alert. If you already have a query in the overview page search bar it will
be carried over into this box.

==== TLS alerts

Uptime also provides the ability to create an alert that will notify you when one or
more of your monitors have a TLS certificate that will expire within some threshold,
or when its age exceeds a limit. The values for these thresholds are configurable on
the <<uptime-settings, Settings page>>.
