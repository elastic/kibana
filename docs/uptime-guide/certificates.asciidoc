=== Certificates

The certificates page enables you to visualize TLS certificate data in your indices. In addition to the
common name, associated monitors, issuer information, and SHA fingerprints, Uptime also assigns a status
derived from the threshold values in the <<uptime-settings, Settings page>>.

Several of the columns on this page are sortable. You can use the search bar at the top of the view
to find values in most of the TLS-related fields in your Uptime indices. Additionally, using the `Alerts`
dropdown at the top of the page you can create a TLS alert.
