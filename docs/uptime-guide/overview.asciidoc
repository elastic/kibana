== Overview

The Elastic Uptime solution built on the Elastic Stack.
It allows you to monitor the availability and response time of software services and applications in real time.

Based on {heartbeat-ref}/index.html[Heartbeat], an open source uptime monitor, Elastic Uptime is transparent,
flexible, and developer-friendly.
It can be deployed both inside and outside your organization's network to understand service uptime and
response time characteristics from multiple network vantage points.
