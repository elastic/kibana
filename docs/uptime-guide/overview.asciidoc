== Overview

Uptime allows you to monitor the status of network endpoints via HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP.
You can explore endpoint status over time, drill down into specific monitors,
and easily view a high-level snapshot of your environment at any point in time.

Uptime requires the setup of monitors in {heartbeat-ref}/index.html[Heartbeat].
Once monitors have been set up, you can visualize the data they provide in the
{uptime-guide}/overview.html[Uptime UI].
