== Getting started

The easiest way to get started with Elastic Uptime is by using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud. The {es} Service is available on both AWS and GCP.
and automatically configures APM Server to work with {es} and {kib}.

=== Hosted Elasticsearch Service

Skip managing your own {es}, and {kib} instance by using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud.

then jump straight to <<install-heartbeat>>.

=== Install the stack yourself

If you'd rather install the stack yourself,
first see the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Elastic Support Matrix] for information about supported operating systems and product compatibility.

[[install-elasticsearch]]
=== Step 1: Install Elasticsearch

Install an Elasticsearch cluster, start it up, and make sure it's running.

. Verify that your system meets the
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_jvm[minimum JVM requirements] for {es}.
. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-elasticsearch[Install Elasticsearch].
. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#_make_sure_elasticsearch_is_up_and_running[Make sure elasticsearch is up and running].

[[install-kibana]]
=== Step 2: Install Kibana

Install Kibana, start it up, and open up the web interface:

. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-kibana[Install Kibana].
. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#_launch_the_kibana_web_interface[Launch the Kibana Web Interface].

[[install-heartbeat]]
=== Step 3: Install and configure Heartbeat

IMPORTANT: Make sure you're using the same major versions of Heartbeat and Kibana.

The *Setup Instructions* in Kibana will get you started with installing and configuring Heartbeat.

Index patterns tell Kibana which Elasticsearch indices you want to explore.
The Uptime UI requires a `heartbeat-7*`` index pattern.
If you have configured a different index pattern, you can use field aliases to ensure data is recognized by the UI.

After you install and configure Heartbeat,
the {uptime-guide}/overview.html[Uptime UI] will automatically populate with the Heartbeat monitors.
