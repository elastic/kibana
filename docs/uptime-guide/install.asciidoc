== Install Uptime

The easiest way to get started with Elastic Uptime is by using our hosted {es} Service on Elastic Cloud.
The {es} Service is available on both AWS and GCP,
and automatically configures {es} and {kib}.

=== Hosted Elasticsearch Service

Skip managing your own {es} and {kib} instance by using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud.

then jump straight to <<install-heartbeat>>.

=== Install the stack yourself

If you'd rather install the stack yourself,
first see the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Elastic Support Matrix] for information about supported operating systems and product compatibility.

* <<install-elasticsearch>>
* <<install-kibana>>
* <<install-heartbeat>>

[[install-elasticsearch]]
=== Step 1: Install Elasticsearch

Install an {es} cluster, start it up, and make sure it's running.

. Verify that your system meets the
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_jvm[minimum JVM requirements] for {es}.
. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-elasticsearch[Install Elasticsearch].
. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#_make_sure_elasticsearch_is_up_and_running[Make sure elasticsearch is up and running].

[[install-kibana]]
=== Step 2: Install Kibana

Install {kib}, start it up, and open up the web interface:

. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-kibana[Install Kibana].
. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#_launch_the_kibana_web_interface[Launch the Kibana Web Interface].

[[install-heartbeat]]
=== Step 3: Install and configure Heartbeat

Uptime requires the setup of monitors in Heartbeat.
These monitors provide the data you'll be visualizing in the {kibana-ref}/xpack-uptime.html[Uptime app].

For instructions on installing and configuring Heartbeat, see the *Setup Instructions* in {kib}.
Additional information is available in {heartbeat-ref}/heartbeat-configuration.html[Configure Heartbeat].

=== Step 4: Set up Security

Secure your installation by following the {heartbeat-ref}/securing-heartbeat.html[Secure Heartbeat] documentation.

==== Important considerations

* Make sure you're using the same major versions of Heartbeat and {kib}.

* Index patterns tell {kib} which {es} indices you want to explore.
The Uptime app requires a +heartbeat-{major-version-only}*+ index pattern.
If you have configured a different index pattern, you can use {ref}/indices-aliases.html[index aliases] to ensure data is recognized by the Uptime app.

After you install and configure Heartbeat,
the {kibana-ref}/xpack-uptime.html[Uptime app] is automatically populated with the Heartbeat monitors.
