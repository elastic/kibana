You can interactively explore your data from the Discover page. You have access to every document in every index that
matches the selected index pattern. You can submit search queries, filter the search results, and view document data.
You can also see the number of documents that match the search query and get field value statistics. If a time field is
configured for the selected index pattern, the distribution of documents over time is displayed in a histogram at the
top of the page.
