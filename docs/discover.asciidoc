[[discover]]
== Discover
You can interactively explore your data from the Discover page. You have access to every document in every index that 
matches the selected index pattern. You can submit search queries, filter the search results, and view document data. 
You can also see the number of documents that match the search query and get field value statistics. If a time field is 
configured for the selected index pattern, the distribution of documents over time is displayed in a histogram at the 
top of the page.

[[set-time-filter]]
=== Setting the Time Filter
The Time Filter restricts the search results to a specific time period. You can set a time filter if your index 
contains time-based events and a time-field is configured for the selected index pattern.

By default the time filter is set to the last 15 minutes. You can use the Time Picker to change the time filter
or select a specific time interval or time range in the histogram at the top of the page.

To set a time filter with the Time Picker:

. Click the Time Filter displayed in the upper right corner of the menu bar to open the Time Picker.
. To set a quick filter, simply click one of the shortcut links.
. To specify a relative Time Filter, click *Relative* and enter the relative start time. You can specify
the relative start time as any number of seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years ago.
. To specify an absolute Time Filter, click *Absolute* and enter the start date in the *From* field and the end date in 
the *To* field.
. Click the caret at the bottom of the Time Picker to hide it. 

To set a Time Filter from the histogram, do one of the following:

* Click the bar that represents the time interval you want to zoom in on.
* Click and drag to view a specific timespan. You must start the selection with the cursor over the background of the 
chart--the cursor changes to a plus sign when you hover over a valid start point. 

You can use the browser Back button to undo your changes. 

The histogram lists the time range you're currently exploring, as well as the intervals that range is currently using. 
To change the intervals, click the link and select an interval from the drop-down. The default behavior automatically 
sets an interval based on the time range.

[[search]]
=== Searching Your Data
You can search the indices that match the current index pattern by submitting a search from the Discover page.
You can enter simple query strings, use the 
Lucene https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html[query syntax], or use the full JSON-based 
{ref}/query-dsl.html[Elasticsearch Query DSL]. 

When you submit a search, the histogram, Documents table, and Fields list are updated to reflect 
the search results. The total number of hits (matching documents) is shown in the upper right corner of the
histogram. The Documents table shows the first five hundred hits. By default, the hits are listed in reverse 
chronological order, with the newest documents shown first. You can reverse the sort order by by clicking on the Time 
column header. You can also sort the table using the values in any indexed field. For more information, see 
<<sorting,Sorting the Documents Table>>.

To search your data:

. Enter a query string in the Search field: 
+
* To perform a free text search, simply enter a text string. For example, if you're searching web server logs, you 
could enter `safari` to search all fields for the term `safari`.
+
* To search for a value in a specific field, you prefix the value with the name of the field. For example, you could 
enter `status:200` to limit the results to entries that contain the value `200` in the `status` field.
+
* To search for a range of values, you can use the bracketed range syntax, `[START_VALUE TO END_VALUE]`. For example, 
to find entries that have 4xx status codes, you could enter `status:[400 TO 499]`.
+
* To specify more complex search criteria, you can use the Boolean operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. For example,
to find entries that have 4xx status codes and have an extension of `php` or `html`, you could enter `status:[400 TO 
499] AND (extension:php OR extension:html)`.
+
NOTE: These examples use the Lucene query syntax. You can also submit queries using the Elasticsearch Query DSL. For 
examples, see {ref}/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax[query string syntax] in the Elasticsearch 
Reference.
+
. Press *Enter* or click the *Search* button to submit your search query.

[[field-filter]]
=== Filtering by Field
You can filter the search results to display only those documents that contain a particular value in a field. You can 
also create negative filters that exclude documents that contain the specified field value.

You can add filters from the Fields list or from the Documents table. When you add a filter, it is displayed in the 
filter bar below the search query. From the filter bar, you can enable or disable a filter, invert the filter (change 
it from a positive filter to a negative filter and vice-versa), toggle the filter on or off, or remove it entirely. 
Click the small left-facing arrow to the right of the index pattern selection drop-down to collapse the Fields list.

To add a filter from the Fields list:

. Click the name of the field you want to filter on. This displays the top five values for that field. To the right of 
each value, there are two magnifying glass buttons--one for adding a regular (positive) filter, and 
one for adding a negative filter. 
. To add a positive filter, click the *Positive Filter* button image:images/PositiveFilter.jpg[Positive Filter Button]. 
This filters out documents that don't contain that value in the field.
. To add a negative filter, click the *Negative Filter* button image:images/NegativeFilter.jpg[Negative Filter Button]. 
This excludes documents that contain that value in the field. 

To add a filter from the Documents table:

. Expand a document in the Documents table by clicking the *Expand* button image:images/ExpandButton.jpg[Expand Button] 
to the left of the document's entry in the first column (the first column is usually Time). To the right of each field 
name, there are two magnifying glass buttons--one for adding a regular (positive) filter, and one for adding a negative 
filter. 
. To add a positive filter  based on the document's value in a field, click the 
*Positive Filter* button image:images/PositiveFilter.jpg[Positive Filter Button]. This filters out documents that don't 
contain the specified value in that field.
. To add a negative filter based on the document's value in a field, click the 
*Negative Filter* button image:images/NegativeFilter.jpg[Negative Filter Button]. This excludes documents that contain 
the specified value in that field.

[[document-data]]
=== Viewing Document Data
When you submit a search query, the 500 most recent documents that match the query are listed in the Documents table. 
You can configure the number of documents shown in the table by setting the `discover:sampleSize` property in 
<<advanced-options,Advanced Settings>>. By default, the table shows the localized version of the time field specified 
in the selected index pattern and the document `_source`. You can <<adding-columns, add fields to the Documents table>> 
from the Fields list. You can <<sorting, sort the listed documents>> by any indexed field that's included in the table.

To view a document's field data, click the *Expand* button image:images/ExpandButton.jpg[Expand Button] to the left of 
the document's entry in the first column (the first column is usually Time). Kibana reads the document data from 
Elasticsearch and displays the document fields in a table. The table contains a row for each field that contains the 
name of the field, add filter buttons, and the field value.

. To view the original JSON document (pretty-printed), click the *JSON* tab.
. To view the document data as a separate page, click the link. You can bookmark and share this link to provide direct 
access to a particular document.
. To collapse the document details, click the *Collapse* button image:images/CollapseButton.jpg[Collapse Button].
. To toggle a particular field's column in the Documents table, click the 
image:images/add-column-button.png[Add Column] *Toggle column in table* button.

[float]
[[sorting]]
==== Sorting the Document List
You can sort the documents in the Documents table by the values in any indexed field. Documents in index patterns that 
are configured with time fields are sorted in reverse chronological order by default.

To change the sort order, click the name of the field you want to sort by. The fields you can use for sorting have a 
sort button to the right of the field name. Clicking the field name a second time reverses the sort order.

[float]
[[adding-columns]]
==== Adding Field Columns to the Documents Table
By default, the Documents table shows the localized version of the time field specified in the selected index pattern 
and the document `_source`. You can add fields to the table from the Fields list or from a document's expanded view.

To add field columns to the Documents table:

. Mouse over a field in the Fields list and click its  *add* button image:images/AddFieldButton.jpg[Add Field Button].  
. Repeat until you've added all the fields you want to display in the Documents table.
. Alternately, add a field column directly from a document's expanded view by clicking the 
image:images/add-column-button.png[Add Column] *Toggle column in table* button.

The added field columns replace the `_source` column in the Documents table. The added fields are also
listed in the *Selected Fields* section at the top of the field list. 

To rearrange the field columns in the table, mouse over the header of the column you want to move and click the *Move* 
button.

[[removing-columns]]
==== Removing Field Columns from the Documents Table
To remove field columns from the Documents table:

. Mouse over the field you want to remove in the *Selected Fields* section of the Fields list and click its *remove* 
button image:images/RemoveFieldButton.jpg[Remove Field Button].
. Repeat until you've removed all the fields you want to drop from the Documents table.

[float]
[[viewing-field-stats]]
=== Viewing Field Data Statistics
From the field list, you can see how many documents in the Documents table contain a particular field, what the top 5 
values are, and what percentage of documents contain each value. 

To view field data statistics, click the name of a field in the Fields list. The field can be anywhere in the Fields 
list.
