== Visualize

You can use the _Visualize_ page to design data visualizations. You can save these visualizations, use them 
individually, or combine visualizations into a _dashboard_. A visualization can be based on one of the following 
data source types:

* A new interactive search
* A saved search
* An existing saved visualization

Visualizations are based on the {ref}search-aggregations.html[aggregation] feature introduced in Elasticsearch 1.x.

=== Creating a New Visualization

Click on the *Visualize* image:images/visualize-icon.png[chart icon] tab in the left-hand navigation bar. If you are
already creating a visualization, you can click the *New* button in the toolbar. To set up your visualization, follow
these steps:

[[newvis01]]
==== Step 1: Choose the Visualization Type

Choose a visualization type when you start the New Visualization wizard:

[horizontal]
<<area-chart,Area chart>>:: Use area charts to visualize the total contribution of several different series.
<<data-table,Data table>>:: Use data tables to display the raw data of a composed aggregation. You can display the data 
table for several other visualizations by clicking at the bottom of the visualization.
<<line-chart,Line chart>>:: Use line charts to compare different series.
<<markdown-widget,Markdown widget>>:: Use the Markdown widget to display free-form information or instructions about your 
dashboard.
<<metric-chart,Metric>>:: Use the metric visualization to display a single number on your dashboard.
<<pie-chart,Pie chart>>:: Use pie charts to display each source's contribution to a total.
<<tilemap,Tile map>>:: Use tile maps to associate the results of an aggregation with geographic points.
<<vertical-bar-chart,Vertical bar chart>>:: Use vertical bar charts as a general-purpose chart.

You can also load a saved visualization that you created earlier. The saved visualization selector includes a text 
field to filter by visualization name and a link to the Object Editor, accessible through *Settings > Objects*, to 
manage your saved visualizations.

If your new visualization is a Markdown widget, selecting that type takes you to a text entry field where you enter the 
text to display in the widget. For all other types of visualization, selecting the type takes you to data source 
selection.

==== Step 2: Choose a Data Source

You can choose a new or saved search to serve as the data source for your visualization. Searches are associated with
an index or a set of indexes. When you select _new search_ on a system with multiple indices configured, select an 
index pattern from the drop-down to bring up the visualization editor. 

When you create a visualization from a saved search and save the visualization, the search is tied to the visualization.
When you make changes to the search that is linked to the visualization, the visualization updates automatically.

==== Step 3: The Visualization Editor

The visualization editor enables you to configure and edit visualizations. The visualization editor has the following 
main elements:

1. <<toolbar-panel,Toolbar>>
2. <<aggregation-builder,Aggregation Builder>>
3. <<preview-canvas,Preview Canvas>>

[[toolbar-panel]]
===== Toolbar

The toolbar has a search field for interactive data searches, as well as controls to manage saving and loading
visualizations. For visualizations based on saved searches, the search bar is grayed out. To edit the search, replacing 
the saved search with the edited version, double-click the search field.

The toolbar at the right of the search box has buttons for creating new visualizations, saving the current 
visualization, loading an existing visualization, sharing or embedding the visualization, and refreshing the data for 
the current visualization.

[float]
[[aggregation-builder]]
===== Aggregation Builder

Use the aggregation builder on the left of the page to configure the {ref}search-aggregations-metrics.html[metric] and {ref}search-aggregations-bucket.html[bucket] aggregations used in your 
visualization. Buckets are analogous to SQL `GROUP BY` statements. For more information on aggregations, see the main
{ref}search-aggregations.html[Elasticsearch aggregations reference].

Bar, line, or area chart visualizations use _metrics_ for the y-axis and _buckets_ are used for the x-axis, segment bar 
colors, and row/column splits. For pie charts, use the metric for the slice size and the bucket for the number of 
slices.

Choose the metric aggregation for your visualization's Y axis, such as 
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-valuecount-aggregation.html[count], 
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-avg-aggregation.html[average], 
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-sum-aggregation.html[sum], 
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-min-aggregation.html[min], 
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-max-aggregation.html[max], or 
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html[cardinality] 
(unique count). Use bucket aggregations for the visualization's X axis, color slices, and row/column splits. Common 
bucket aggregations include date histogram, range, terms, filters, and significant terms.

You can set the order in which buckets execute. In Elasticsearch, the first aggregation determines the data set 
for any subsequent aggregations. The following example involves a date bar chart of Web page hits for the top 5 file 
extensions.

To use the same extension across all hits, set this order:

1.  *Color:* Terms aggregation of extensions
2.  *X-Axis:* Date bar chart of `@timestamp`

Elasticsearch collects the records for the top 5 extensions, then creates a date bar chart for each extension.

To chart the top 5 extensions for each hour, use the following order:

1.  *X-Axis:* Date bar chart of `@timestamp` (with 1 hour interval)
2.  *Color:* Terms aggregation of extensions

For these requests, Elasticsearch creates a date bar chart from all the records, then groups the top five extensions 
inside each bucket, which in this example is a one-hour interval.

NOTE: Remember, each subsequent bucket slices the data from the previous bucket.

To render the visualization on the _preview canvas_, click the  *Apply Changes* button at the top right of the
Aggregation Builder.

===== Preview Canvas

The preview canvas displays a preview of the visualization you've defined in the aggregation builder. To refresh the 
visualization preview, clicking the *Apply Changes* image:images/apply-changes-button.png[] button on the toolbar.
