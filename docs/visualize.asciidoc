Visualize enables you to create visualizations of the data from your Elasticsearch indices, which you can then add to dashboards for analysis.
 
Kibana visualizations are based on Elasticsearch queries. By using a series of Elasticsearch aggregations to extract and process your data, you can create charts that show you the trends, spikes, and dips you need to know about.
 
Create visualizations from a search saved in Discover, or start with a new search query.
 
With visualizations, you can:
* Cool thing 1
* Cool thing 2
* Cool thing 3
