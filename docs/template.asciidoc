Include a short description. The short description should always include 
the value prop, answer why users want to use the feature, and how the 
feature benefits them. 

For easy navigation, include the links to the key sections in a bulleted 
list. This way, users can click exactly where they want to go instead of 
scrolling down the page:

* <<task-section-description, Task section title>>
* <<section2-description, Task section title>>
* <<section3-description, Task section title>>

TIP: Keep lists to 5-7 items, plus or minus 2 when absolutely necessary.

Provide a screenshot or video.

TIP: Need inspiration? Here are some good examples:
* <<snapshot-repositories, Snapshot and Restore>>
* <<dashboard, Dashboard>>
* <<canvas, Canvas>>

. Step 5.

TIP: When you create task sections, you only need to explain the details that users can't see on the screen. Avoid giving users a tour of the UI or providing instructions on how to use every action on the screen. Delete and save are common actions that users can typically figure out themselves.
