////
To make it easier to scan the TOC, include critical information first. For example, instead of `Backing up your data with snapshot and restore`, use `Snapshot and restore`.
////

Include a short description. The short description should always include 
the value prop, answer why users want to use the feature, and how the 
feature benefits them.

For easy navigation, include the links to the key sections in a bulleted 
list. This way, users can click exactly where they want to go instead of 
scrolling down the page:

* <<task-section-description, Task section title>>
* <<section2-description, Task section title>>
* <<section3-description, Task section title>>

TIP: Keep lists to 5-7 items, plus or minus 2 when absolutely necessary.

Provide a screenshot or video.
//Screenshots must be 16:9 ratio.

TIP: Need introduction inspiration? Here are some good examples:
* <<dashboard, Dashboard>>
* <<canvas, Canvas>>

////
For task section titles, do not use gerunds. For example, instead of `Creating a Canvas workpad`, use `Create a Canvas workpad`.

Provide an example or walkthrough of how to use the feature. Whenever possible, 
use the <<add-sample-data, sample data>>.

[[section2-description]]
=== Task section title

Add an optional short description for what this task accomplishes. For example, why would someone want to do this task and how does it benefit them? 

When you create task sections, you only need to explain the details that users can't see on the screen. Avoid giving a tour of the UI or providing instructions on how to use every action on the screen. Delete and save are common actions that users can typically figure out themselves.

To provide steps, use the following:

. Step 1.
. Step 2.
+
When necessary, include explanatory text for the task step.
. Step 3.
. Step 4.

. Step 5.

////
When you develop your task content, use the following guidelines:
* Match your text to the UI.
* For clickable items, use *bold*.
* When you refer to a UI button, use `click`. For example, `Click *New*.`
* When you refer to a UI checkbox or path, use `select`. For example, `Select all index checkboxes` and `Select *Manage index* > *Add lifecycle policy*.`
* Avoid using `button` and similar words. For example, use `Click *Save*.` instead of `Click on the *Save* button.`
