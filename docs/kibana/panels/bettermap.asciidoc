== Bettermap
Status: *Experimental*

Bettermap is called bettermap for lack of a better name. Bettermap uses geographic coordinates to
create clusters of markers on map and shade them orange, yellow and green depending on the
density of the cluster.

To drill down, click on a cluster. The map will be zoomed and the cluster broken into smaller cluster.
When it no longer makes visual sense to cluster, individual markers will be displayed. Hover over
a marker to see the tooltip value/

IMPORTANT: bettermap requires an internet connection to download its map panels.

=== Parameters

field:: The field that contains the coordinates, in geojson format. GeoJSON is
+[longitude,latitude]+ in an array. This is different from most implementations, which use
latitude, longitude.
size:: The number of documents to use when drawing the map
spyable:: Should the `inspect` icon be shown?
tooltip:: Which field to use for the tooltip when hovering over a marker

==== Queries
queries object:: This object describes the queries to use on this panel.
queries.mode::: Of the queries available, which to use. Options: +all, pinned, unpinned, selected+
queries.ids::: In +selected+ mode, which query ids are selected.
