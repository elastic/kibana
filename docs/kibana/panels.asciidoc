*Kibana* dashboards are made up of blocks called +panels+. Panels are organized into rows
and can serve many purposes, though most are designed to provide the results of a query or
multiple queries as a visualization. Other panels may show collections of documents or
allow you to insert instructions for your users.

Panels can be configured easily via the Kibana web interface. For more advanced usage, such
as templated or scripted dashboards, documentation of panel properties is available in this
section. You may find settings here which are not exposed via the web interface.

Each panel type has its own properties, however there are several that are shared.

span:: A number, 1-12, that describes the width of the panel.
editable:: Enable or disable the edit button of the panel
type:: The type of panel this object contains. Each panel type will require additional
properties. See the panel types list to the right.
