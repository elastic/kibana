Dashboard panels have an *Explore underlying data* action that navigates you to *Discover*,
where you can narrow your documents to the ones you'll most likely use in a  visualization.
This action is available for visualizations backed by a single index pattern.

You can access *Explore underlying data* in two ways: from the panel context
menu or from the menu that appears when you interact with the chart.

carrying over the index pattern, filters, query, and time range for the visualization.

Initiating *Explore underlying data* from the chart also navigates to Discover,
carrying over the current context for the visualization. In addition, this action
applies the filters and time range created by the events that triggered the action.
