== Explore data underlying visualizations

Dashboard panels have "Explore underlying data" actions that will redirect
you to Discover app narrowing down Discover documents to ones likely used in
the visualization.

"Explore underlying data" actions are available for visualizations which are
backed by a single index pattern.

There are two "Explore underlying data" actions: (1) one which appears in the
panel's context menu; (2) and the other which appears when user clicks or brushes
the chart.

Context menu "Explore underlying data" action will navigate you to Discover app,
to the index pattern used in the visualization and will carry over all filters,
query, and time range used in the visualization.

=== Explore data from chart action

In-chart "Explore underlying data" action will also navigate you to Discover app,
to the index pattern used in the visualization and will carry over all the
filters, query and time range, but it will also apply the filters and time range
created from the click or brush events that triggered this action to appear in
context menu. For example, if you will brush a chart the time range associated
with that brush event will be carried over to Discover app.
