[[drilldowns]]
== Use drilldowns for dashboard actions

Drilldowns, also known as custom actions, allow you to configure a
workflow for analyzing and troubleshooting your data.
Using a drilldown, you can navigate from one dashboard to another,
taking the current time range, filters, and other parameters with you.
Although the destination dashboard shows the data in a different structure,
the context is the same. You can continue your investigation from a new perspective.

For example, you might have a dashboard that shows the overall status of multiple data centers.
You can create a drilldown that navigates from this dashboard to a dashboard
that shows a specific data center or server.

=== How drilldowns work

Drilldowns are Kibana actions configured by the user and stored
in the dashboard saved object. Drilldowns are specific to the dashboard panel
for which they are created&mdash;they are not shared across panels.
A panel can have multiple drilldowns.

This example shows a dashboard panel that contains a pie chart.
Typically, clicking a pie slice applies the current filter.
When a panel has a drilldown, clicking a pie slice opens a menu with
the default action and your drilldowns. See the <<drilldowns-example, Try it section>> of this doc
for instructions on how to create this drilldown.

Third-party developers can create drilldowns.
See https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/x-pack/examples/ui_actions_enhanced_examples[this example plugin]
to learn how to code drilldowns.

[[create-manage-drilldowns]]
=== Create and manage drilldowns

To create and manage drilldowns, your dashboard must be in *Edit* mode.
The panel menu will then include a *Create drilldown* action.
Once a panel has at least one drilldown, the menu also includes a *Manage drilldowns* action
for editing and deleting drilldowns.

==== Set up the dashboards

. Add the <<get-data-in, sample web logs>> data set.

. Create a new dashboard, called *Host Overview*, and include these visualizations
from the sample data set:
+
[%hardbreaks]
*[Logs] Heatmap*
*[Logs] Visitors by OS*
*[Logs] Host, Visits, and Bytes Table*
*[Logs] Total Requests and Bytes*
+
TIP: If you don’t see data for a panel, try changing the time range.

. Open the prebuilt *[Logs] Web traffic* dashboard.

. Set a search and filter.
+
[%hardbreaks]
Search: `extension.keyword:( “gz” or “css” or “deb”)`
Filter: `geo.src : CN`

[float]
==== Create the drilldown


. In the dashboard menu bar, click *Edit*.

. In *[Logs] Visitors by OS*, open the panel menu, and then select *Create drilldown*.

. Give the drilldown a name.

. Select *Host Overview* as the destination dashboard.

. Keep both filters enabled so that the drilldown carries over the global filters and date range.

. Save the dashboard.
+
If you don’t save the drilldown, and then navigate away, the drilldown is lost.

. In *[Logs] Visitors by OS*, click the “win 8” slice of the pie, and then click the name of your drilldown.
+
You are navigated to your destination dashboard. Verify that the search query, filters,
and time range are carried over.
