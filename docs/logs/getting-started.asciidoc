== Getting started with the log monitoring

To get started with the Logs app in Kibana, you need to start collecting logs data for your infrastructure.

Kibana provides step-by-step instructions to help you add log data. The
{infra-guide}[Infrastructure Monitoring Guide] is a good source for more
detailed information and instructions.
