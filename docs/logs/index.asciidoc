The Logs app in Kibana enables you to explore logs for common servers, containers, and services.

The Logs app has a compact, console-like display that you can customize.
You can filter the logs by various fields, start and stop live streaming, and highlight text of interest.

You can open the Logs app from the *Logs* tab in Kibana.
You can also open the Logs app directly from a component in the Metrics app.
In this case, you will only see the logs for the selected component.
