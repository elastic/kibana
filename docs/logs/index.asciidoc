== Add data sources

Kibana provides step-by-step instructions to help you add your data sources.
The {infra-guide}[Infrastructure Monitoring Guide] is a good source for more detailed information and
instructions.

[float]
== Configure data sources 

By default the Logs UI uses the `filebeat-*` index pattern to query the data. If your logs are located in a different set of indices, you will need to set `xpack.infra.sources.default.logAlias` in `config/kibana.yml` to match your log's index pattern. You can also configure the timestamp field by overriding `xpack.infra.sources.default.fields.timestamp`, by default it is set to `@timestamp`. See <<logs-ui-settings-kb>> for a complete list.
