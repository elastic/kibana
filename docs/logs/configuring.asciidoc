== Configuring the Logs UI

The `filebeat-*` index pattern is used to query data by default. If your logs
are located in a different set of indices, use a different timestamp field, or
contain parsed fields which you want to expose as individual columns, you can
adjust the source configuration via the user interface or the {kib}
configuration file.

NOTE: Logs and Infrastructure share a common data source definition in
each space. Changes in one of them can influence the data displayed in the
other.

=== Configure source

*Configure source* can be accessed via
image:logs/images/logs-configure-source-gear-icon.png[Configure source icon]
in the toolbar.

This opens the source configuration fly-out dialog with multiple tabs, where
you can inspect and adjust various index settings and log column configuration.

TIP: If <<xpack-spaces>> are enabled in your Kibana instance, any configuration
changes performed via *Configure source* are specific to that space. You can
therefore easily make different subsets of the data available by creating
multiple spaces with different data source configurations.

==== Read only access
When you have insufficient privileges to change the source configuration, the
following indicator in Kibana will be displayed, and the buttons to change the
source configuration won't be visible. For more information, see
<<xpack-security-authorization>>.

==== Indices and fields configuration

The *Indices and fields* tab provides access to the following configuration
items:

* *Name*: The name of the source configuration.
* *Indices*: The patterns of the Elasticsearch indices to read metrics and logs
  from.
* *Fields*: The names of particular fields in the indices that need to be known
  to the Infrastructure and Logs UIs in order to query and interpret the data
  correctly.

==== Log columns configuration

The *Log columns* tab enables you to change the set of columns that are
displayed in the Logs UI. By default the following columns are shown:

* *Timestamp*: The log entry's timestamp as defined in the `timestamp` field.
* *events.dataset*: The event dataset as indicated by this {ecs-link} field.
* *Message*: The message extracted from the document. The exact content of that
  field depends on the type of log message. If no special type is detected, the
  {ecs-link} field `message` is used.

To add a new column, click
image:logs/images/logs-configure-source-dialog-add-column-button.png[Add column]
above the list. This will cause a popover to be shown in which you can filter a
list of the available fields and select one for inclusion:

To remove a column, click
image:logs/images/logs-configure-source-dialog-remove-column-button.png[Remove column]
in the respective entry. The list must contain at least one column to apply the
changes.

[float]
=== Configuration file

The settings in the configuration file are used as a fallback when no other
configuration for that space has been defined. They are located in the
configuration namespace `xpack.infra.sources.default`. See
<<logs-ui-settings-kb>> for a complete list of the possible entries.
