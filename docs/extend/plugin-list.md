Functions can be configured using arguments provided by the user. The final output of the expression pipeline can be rendered using one of the *renderers* registered in `expressions` plugin.  All the arguments to expression functions need to be serializable, as well as input and output. Expression functions should try to stay 'pure'. This makes functions easy to reuse and also  make it possible to serialize the whole chain as well as output at every step of execution.  It is possible to add comments to expressions by starting them with a `//` sequence or by using `/*` and `*/` to enclose multi-line comments.  Expressions power visualizations in Dashboard and Lens, as well as, every *element* in Canvas is backed by an expression.

For example, to the dashboard filtering trigger multiple actions can be attached. Once a user filters on the dashboard all possible actions are displayed to the user in a popup menu and the user has to chose one.  In general this plugin provides:  - Creating custom functionality (actions). - Creating custom user interaction events (triggers). - Attaching and detaching actions to triggers. - Emitting trigger events. - Executing actions attached to a given trigger. - Exposing a context menu for the user to choose the appropriate action when there are multiple actions attached to a single trigger. |
