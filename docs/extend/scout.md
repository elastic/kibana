# Scout [scout]

Scout is Kibana’s **modern UI and API test framework** built on [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). It focuses on **fast test execution**, a good **developer experience**, and **reusable** test building blocks (e.g., [fixtures](./scout/fixtures.md), [page objects](./scout/page-objects.md) and [API services](./scout/api-services.md)).

## Start here [scout-start-here]

- [Getting started](./scout/getting-started.md)
- [Best practices](./scout/best-practices.md) (see also [UI test best practices](./scout/ui-best-practices.md) and [API test best practices](./scout/api-best-practices.md))
- [UI testing](./scout/ui-testing.md)
- [API testing](./scout/api-testing.md)

## Scout benefits [scout-main-features]

- **Parallel execution**: run UI suites in [parallel](./scout/parallelism.md) against the same deployment.
- **Selective testing**: PR builds run only the Scout tests scoped to changed modules, cutting CI time.
- **Co-located tests**: keep tests close to [plugin code](./scout/setup-plugin.md) for easier iteration and maintenance.
- **Deployment-agnostic**: write tests once, then use [tags](./scout/deployment-tags.md) to declare where they should run (stateful/serverless).
- **Fixture-based**: [fixtures](./scout/fixtures.md) cover auth, data setup, clients, and common workflows.
- **Better debugging**: use Playwright [UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode).
- **Reporting**: we capture test events that power our dashboards (for example, skipped tests, flaky tests, and more).
- **Reusability**: reuse or write reusable fixtures, page objects and API helpers to reduce duplication.
- **Follows modern best practices**: check out our [Scout best practices](./scout/best-practices.md).

## Scout packages [scout-packages]

**Import the right Scout package in your Scout tests:**

- **Platform-owned tests** → `@kbn/scout`

| Package      | Use in tests               |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| `@kbn/scout` | Platform (shared baseline) |

- **Solution-owned tests** → your solution Scout package (it builds on `@kbn/scout`)

| Package               | Use in tests                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `@kbn/scout-oblt`     | {icon}`logo_observability` Observability solution |
| `@kbn/scout-security` | {icon}`logo_security` Security solution           |
| `@kbn/scout-search`   | {icon}`logo_elasticsearch` Search solution        |

::::::{note}
Fixtures, page objects, and API helpers defined in `@kbn/scout` can be imported by solution-specific Scout packages. When they are defined in a solution package or a plugin they will only be available to that solution or plugin.

## FAQ [scout-faq]

#### Q: Does Scout prevent flaky tests? [scout-faq-flakes]

No—good test design still matters.

#### Q: Is Scout designed to be _just_ a Playwright UI test runner? [scout-faq-ui-only]

No. Scout supports both UI and API testing with Playwright.

#### Q: Are test runs going to be faster? [scout-faq-faster]

Often yes, especially with [parallel test execution](./scout/parallelism.md) and selective testing.

#### Q: What is selective testing? [scout-faq-selective-testing]

In PR builds, Scout automatically detects which modules changed and runs only the relevant tests, reducing CI time. You can confirm your tests ran by looking for the `affected Scout:` prefix on Buildkite steps. See PR [#261510](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/261510) for details.

#### Q: Why is it a good idea for tests to be close to the plugin code? [scout-faq-colocation]

It’s easier to iterate and maintain, and it enables selective testing: PR builds automatically run only the Scout tests for affected modules.

#### Q: Can I use FTR services in Scout (for example, `esArchiver`)? [scout-faq-ftr-services]

Not directly—use Scout [fixtures](./scout/fixtures.md) instead.

#### Q: What happens to FTR tests? [scout-faq-ftr-tests]

Existing FTR tests continue to run, and teams can migrate them to Scout incrementally over time.

#### Q: Does Scout support feature flags? [scout-faq-feature-flags]

Yes. See [Feature flags](./scout/feature-flags.md) for details on enabling flags at runtime with `apiServices.core.settings()` or using custom server configurations.
