==== Read only access
When you have insufficient privileges to save Timelion sheets, the following indicator in Kibana will be
displayed and the *Save* button won't be visible. For more information on granting access to
Kibana see <<xpack-security-authorization>>.

==== Save entire Timelion sheet

Saving an entire Timelion sheet allows you to reload it in the Timelion application and make changes to any of the expressions:

. Click the `Save` option in the top menu
. Select `Save entire Timelion sheet`
. Name your sheet and click `Save`

==== Save as dashboard panel

To save a Timelion expression as a dashboard panel, follow the steps below.

. Select the visualization you’d like to add to one (or multiple) dashboards
. Click the `Save` option in the top menu
. Select `Save current expression as Kibana dashboard panel`
. Name your panel and and click `Save` to save as a dashboard visualization

Now you can add this dashboard panel to any dashboard you’d like. This visualization will now be listed in the Visualize list. Go ahead and follow the same process for the rest of the visualizations you created.

Create a new dashboard or open an existing one to add the Timelion visualizations as you would any other visualization.

TIP: You can also create time series visualizations right from the Visualize
app--just select the Timeseries visualization type and enter a Timelion
expression in the expression field.
