Easy-peasy, now you can add this dashboard panel to any dashboard you’d like! Let’s go ahead and follow the same process for the rest of the visualizations we created.

Now, open up a new or existing dashboard and add the Timelion visualizations as you would any other visualization.

TIP: You can also create time series visualizations right from the Visualize
app--just select the Timeseries visualization type and enter a Timelion
expression in the expression field.
