=== Moving saved objects between spaces
You can use {kib}'s <<managing-saved-objects-export-objects, import/export>> interface to copy objects from one space to another:

1.  Navigate to the space that contains your saved objects.
2.  Export your saved objects via the <<managing-saved-objects-export-objects, import/export>> interface.
3.  Navigate to the space you are importing to.
4.  Import your saved objects via the <<managing-saved-objects-export-objects, import/export>> interface.
5. (optional) Delete the saved objects from the space you exported from, if you don't want to keep a copy there.


[NOTE]
{kib} also has experimental <<dashboard-import-api-import, import>> and <<dashboard-import-api-export, export>> dashboard APIs if you are looking for a dashboard-centric way to automate this process.
