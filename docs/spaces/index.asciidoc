== Spaces

Spaces enable you to organize your dashboards and other saved 
objects into meaningful categories. Once inside a space, you see only 
the dashboards and saved objects that belong to that space. 

{kib} creates a default space for you. 
After you create your own 
spaces, you're asked to choose a space when you enter Kibana. You can change your 
current space at any time.

Kibana supports spaces in several ways.  You can:

[[spaces-getting-started]]

* <<spaces-managing, View&comma; create&comma; and delete spaces>>
* <<spaces-control-feature-visibility, Control feature access based on user need>>
* <<spaces-control-user-access, Control feature access based on user privilege>>
* <<spaces-moving-objects, Move objects between spaces>>
* <<spaces-delete-started, Disable the Spaces feature>>

[[spaces-managing]]
=== View, create, and delete spaces

The **Management > Spaces** overview lists your spaces and provides actions 
for you to create, edit, and delete spaces.

==== Create a space 

You can create as many spaces as you like. Each space must have a unique 
space identifier. This short text string becomes part of the 
{kib} URL when you are inside that space. {kib} suggests a space identifier based 
on the name of your space, but you can customize the identifier to your liking.
You cannot change the space identifier once you create the space.

{kib} also has an <<spaces-api, experimental API>> if you prefer to create spaces programatically.

[float]
==== Delete a space

Deleting a space permanently removes the space and all of its contents. 
You can't delete the default space, but you can customize it to your liking.

[float]
[[spaces-control-feature-visibility]]
=== Control feature access based on user need

You have control over which features are visible in each space. 
For example, you might hide Dev Tools 
in your "Executive" space or show Stack Monitoring only in your "Admin" space.
Controlling feature 
visibility is part of the add and edit workflow.

Feature controls is not a security feature. To secure access 
to specific features on a per-user basis, you must configure 
<<xpack-security-authorization, Kibana Security>>.

[float]
[[spaces-control-user-access]]
=== Control feature access based on user privilege

When using Kibana with security, you can configure applications and features 
based on your usersâ€™ privileges. This means different roles can have access 
to different features in the same space. 
Power users might have privileges to create and edit visualizations and dashboards, 
while analysts or executives might have Dashboard and Canvas with read-only privileges.
See <<adding_kibana_privileges>> for details.

[[spaces-moving-objects]]
=== Move saved objects between spaces
Use {kib}'s <<managing-saved-objects-export-objects, import/export>> 
interface to copy objects from one space to another.

. Navigate to the space that contains your saved objects.
. Export your saved objects via the import/export interface.
. Navigate to the space where you want to import the objects.
. Import your saved objects via the import/export interface.
. (Optional) Delete the saved objects from the space you exported from, if you don't want to keep a copy there.

{kib} also has experimental <<dashboard-import-api-import, import>> and 
<<dashboard-import-api-export, export>> dashboard APIs if you want
a dashboard-centric way to automate this process.

[[spaces-delete-started]]
=== Disable and version updates

Spaces are automatically enabled in {kib}. If you don't want use this feature, 
you can disable it
by setting `xpack.spaces.enabled` to `false` in your 
`kibana.yml` configuration file.

If you are upgrading your 
version of {kib}, the default space will contain all of your existing saved objects.
