== Spaces

With spaces, you can organize your dashboards and other saved objects into meaningful categories.
After creating your own spaces, you will be asked to choose a space when you enter {kib}. Once inside a space,
you will only see the dashboards and other saved objects that belong to that space. You can change your active space at any time.

With security enabled, you can control which users have access to individual spaces.
