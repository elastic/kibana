== Spaces

Spaces enable you to organize your dashboards and other saved
objects into meaningful categories. Once inside a space, you see only
the dashboards and saved objects that belong to that space.

{kib} creates a default space for you.
After you create your own
spaces, you're asked to choose a space when you log in to Kibana. You can change your
current space at any time by using the menu.

Kibana supports spaces in several ways.  You can:

[[spaces-getting-started]]

* <<spaces-managing, View&comma; create&comma; and delete spaces>>
* <<spaces-control-feature-visibility, Control feature access based on user needs>>
* <<spaces-control-user-access, Control feature access based on user privileges>>
* <<spaces-moving-objects, Move objects between spaces>>
* <<spaces-default-route, Configure a Space-level landing page>>
* <<spaces-delete-started, Disable the Spaces feature>>

[[spaces-managing]]
=== View, create, and delete spaces

Open the menu, then go to *Stack Management > {kib} > Spaces* for an overview of your spaces.  This view provides actions
for you to create, edit, and delete spaces.

==== Create or edit a space

You can create as many spaces as you like. Click *Create a space* and provide a name,
URL identifier, optional description.

The URL identifier is a short text string that becomes part of the
{kib} URL when you are inside that space. {kib} suggests a URL identifier based
on the name of your space, but you can customize the identifier to your liking.
You cannot change the space identifier once you create the space.

{kib} also has an <<spaces-api, API>>
if you prefer to create spaces programatically.

==== Delete a space

Deleting a space permanently removes the space and all of its contents.
Find the space on the *Spaces* overview page and click the trash icon in the Actions column.
You can't delete the default space, but you can customize it to your liking.

[[spaces-control-feature-visibility]]
=== Control feature access based on user needs

You have control over which features are visible in each space.
For example, you might hide Dev Tools
in your "Executive" space or show Stack Monitoring only in your "Admin" space.
You can define which features to show or hide when you add or edit a space.

Controlling feature
visibility is not a security feature. To secure access
to specific features on a per-user basis, you must configure
<<xpack-security-authorization, Kibana Security>>.

[float]
[[spaces-control-user-access]]
=== Control feature access based on user privileges

When using Kibana with security, you can configure applications and features
based on your usersâ€™ privileges. This means different roles can have access
to different features in the same space.
Power users might have privileges to create and edit visualizations and dashboards,
while analysts or executives might have Dashboard and Canvas with read-only privileges.
See <<adding_kibana_privileges>> for details.

[[spaces-moving-objects]]
=== Move saved objects between spaces

To <<managing-saved-objects-copy-to-space, copy objects>> from one space to another, open the menu,
then go to *Stack Management > {kib} > Saved objects*.

Alternately, you can move objects using {kib}'s <<managing-saved-objects-export-objects, import and export>>
interface.

. Navigate to the space that contains your saved objects.
. Export your saved objects.
. Navigate to the space where you want to import the objects.
. Import your saved objects.
. (Optional) Delete objects in the export space that you no longer need.

{kib} also has beta <<saved-objects-api-import, import>> and
<<saved-objects-api-export, export>> APIs if you want to automate this process.

[float]
[[spaces-default-route]]
=== Configure a Space-level landing page

You can create a custom experience for users by configuring the {kib} landing page on a per-space basis.
The landing page can route users to a specific dashboard, application, or saved object as they enter each space.

To configure the landing page, use the default route setting in <<kibana-general-settings, Management > Advanced settings>>.
For example, you might set the default route to `/app/kibana#/dashboards`.

[[spaces-delete-started]]
=== Disable and version updates

Spaces are automatically enabled in {kib}. If you don't want use this feature,
you can disable it
by setting `xpack.spaces.enabled` to `false` in your
`kibana.yml` configuration file.

If you are upgrading your
version of {kib}, the default space will contain all of your existing saved objects.
