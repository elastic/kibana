== Spaces

With spaces, you can organize your dashboards and other saved objects into meaningful categories.
After creating your own spaces, you will be asked to choose a space when you enter {kib}. Once inside a space,
you will only see the dashboards and other saved objects that belong to that space. You can change your active space at any time.

With {xpack} security, you can control which users have access to individual spaces.
