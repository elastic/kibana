== Spaces

Spaces enable you to organize your dashboards and other saved
objects into meaningful categories. Once inside a space, you see only
the dashboards and saved objects that belong to that space.

{kib} creates a default space for you.
After you create your own
spaces, you're asked to choose a space when you log in to {kib}. You can change your
current space at any time by using the menu.

==== Required privileges

The `kibana_admin` role or equivalent is required to manage **Spaces**.

TIP: Looking to support multiple tenants? Refer to <<xpack-security-multiple-tenants, the Security documentation>> for more information.

[[spaces-managing]]
=== View, create, and delete spaces

Open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Spaces* for an overview of your spaces.  This view provides actions
for you to create, edit, and delete spaces.

[float]
==== Create or edit a space

You can create as many spaces as you like. Click *Create a space* and provide a name,
URL identifier, optional description.

The URL identifier is a short text string that becomes part of the
{kib} URL when you are inside that space. {kib} suggests a URL identifier based
on the name of your space, but you can customize the identifier to your liking.
You cannot change the space identifier once you create the space.

{kib} also has an <<spaces-api, API>>
if you prefer to create spaces programmatically.

==== Delete a space

Deleting a space permanently removes the space and all of its contents.
Find the space on the *Spaces* overview page and click the trash icon in the Actions column.
You can't delete the default space, but you can customize it to your liking.

[float]
[[spaces-control-feature-visibility]]
=== Control feature access based on user needs

You have control over which features are visible in each space.
For example, you might hide *Dev Tools*
in your "Executive" space or show *Stack Monitoring* only in your "Admin" space.
You can define which features to show or hide when you add or edit a space.

Controlling feature
visibility is not a security feature. To secure access
to specific features on a per-user basis, you must configure
<<xpack-security-authorization, {kib} Security>>.

[float]
[[spaces-control-user-access]]
=== Control feature access based on user privileges

When using {kib} with security, you can configure applications and features
based on your users’ privileges. This means different roles can have access
to different features in the same space.
Power users might have privileges to create and edit visualizations and dashboards,
while analysts or executives might have read-only privileges for *Dashboard* and *Canvas*.
Refer to <<adding_kibana_privileges>> for details.

[[spaces-moving-objects]]
=== Move saved objects between spaces

To move saved objects between spaces, you can <<managing-saved-objects-copy-to-space, copy objects>>, or <<managing-saved-objects-export-objects, export and import objects>>.

[float]
[[spaces-default-route]]
=== Configure a space-level landing page

You can create a custom experience for users by configuring the {kib} landing page on a per-space basis.
The landing page can route users to a specific dashboard, application, or saved object as they enter each space.

To configure the landing page, use the default route setting in
<<kibana-general-settings, Stack Management > {kib} > Advanced settings>>.
For example, you might set the default route to `/app/dashboards`.
