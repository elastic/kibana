== Getting Started

Spaces are automatically enabled in {kib}. If you don't wish to use this feature, you can disable it
by setting `xpack.spaces.enabled` to `false` in your `kibana.yml` configuration file.

=== The default space
{kib} will automatically create a default space for you. If you are upgrading from another version of Kibana, then the default space will contain all of your existing saved objects. The default space cannot be deleted, but you are free to customize it to your liking.

=== Managing your spaces
