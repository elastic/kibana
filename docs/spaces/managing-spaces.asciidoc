=== Managing spaces
You can manage spaces from the **Management > Spaces** page. Here you can create, edit, and delete your spaces.

[NOTE]
{kib} has an <<spaces-api, experimental API>> if you want to create your spaces programatically.

==== Creating and updating spaces
You can create as many spaces as you like, but each space must have a unique space identifier. The space identifier is a short string of text that is part of the {kib} URL when you are inside that space. {kib} automatically suggests a space identifier based on the name of your space, but you are free to customize this to your liking.

[NOTE]
You cannot change the space identifier once the space is created.

==== Controlling feature visibility
You can control which {kib} features are visible in each space. For example, you can hide “Dev Tools” in your “Executive” space, if users of that space don’t need this feature.

NOTE: This is not considered a security feature. If you wish to secure access to specific features on a per-user basis, then you need to configure <<xpack-security-authorization, Kibana Security>>.

==== Deleting spaces
Deleting a space is a destructive operation, which cannot be undone. When you delete a space, all of the saved objects that belong to that space are also deleted.
