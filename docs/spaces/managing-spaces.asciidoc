=== Managing spaces
Spaces can be managed from the Management => Spaces screen. From here, you can create, edit, or delete any of your spaces.

[NOTE]
There is an <<spaces-api, experimental API>> available if you wish to create your spaces programatically.

==== Creating and updating spaces
Spaces can be managed from the Management => Spaces screen. You can create as many spaces as you'd like, but each space must have a unique space identifier.

==== Deleting spaces
Deleting a space is a destructive operation, which cannot be undone. When you delete a space, all of the saved objects that belong to that space are also deleted.
