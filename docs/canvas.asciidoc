Canvas is a data visualization and presentation layer that sits within {kib}. 
Backed by {es}, Canvas lets you create dynamic, pixel-perfect, infographic-style 
presentations of your live data. Play with color palettes, add your own CSS elements, 
drag and drop assets â€” and turn your presentations and reports into dynamic works of art.

Canvas combines data with colors, shapes, text, and your own imagination to bring 
dynamic, multi-page, pixel-perfect, data displays to screens large and small.

=== Getting started with Canvas

Each Canvas workpad is made up of at least one page. Pages contain elements, which you 
can arrange and style, and connect to data to create dynamic presentations.

You can install a <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample data set>> to play around. 
Each sample data set includes a Canvas workpad to go along with the data. Once you've 
added the data, open *Canvas* and click the name of the workpad to test things out.

. Try changing the color palette. Click the Back button in your 
browser to undo your change.

. Try dragging the chart around the page. Grab the resize handles to make 
the chart bigger and smaller.

. Now click somewhere off of the element (just not on another element) 
to deselect it. 
+
You will notice a change in the sidebar menu. When no element is selected, you have 
access to the page and workpad-level settings. Feel free to change the page 
background color or rename the workpad.
