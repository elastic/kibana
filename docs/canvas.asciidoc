Congratulations on finding the Canvas application in {kib}. You are in for a treat. 
Canvas is a whole new way of making data look amazing. Canvas combines data with 
colors, shapes, text, and your own imagination to bring dynamic, multi-page, 
pixel-perfect, data displays to screens large and small. 

We made Canvas for people like us. We figure, you are probably people like us: 
you make neat stuff and you want to show that neat stuff to others. Canvas is 
for makers who are a little bit creative, a little bit technical, and whole lot 
of curious.

We've put together <<canvas-getting-started, this Getting Started>> to get you
up and running with Canvas. 

If you want to dig into the expression language and the functions that drive 
Canvas, see the <<canvas-common-functions>> and 
<<canvas-tinymath-functions>>.
