Canvas is a data visualization and presentation layer that sits within {kib}. 
Backed by {es}, Canvas lets you create dynamic, pixel-perfect, infographic-style 
presentations of your live data. Play with color palettes, add your own CSS elements, 
drag and drop assets â€” and turn your presentations and reports into dynamic works of art.

Canvas combines data with colors, shapes, text, and your own imagination to bring 
dynamic, multi-page, pixel-perfect, data displays to screens large and small.
