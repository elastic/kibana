Canvas is a data visualization and presentation layer that sits within {kib}. 
Backed by {es}, Canvas lets you create dynamic, pixel-perfect, infographic-style 
presentations of your live data. Play with color palettes, add your own CSS elements, 
drag and drop assets â€” and turn your presentations and reports into dynamic works of art.

Canvas combines data with colors, shapes, text, and your own imagination to bring 
dynamic, multi-page, pixel-perfect, data displays to screens large and small.

=== Getting started with Canvas

EachCanvas workpad is made up of at least one page. Pages contains elements 
that you can arrange, style, and connect to a data source to create live data displays.

Install a <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample data set>>. Each sample data set includes 
a Canvas workpad to go along with the data. Once you've added the data, open *Canvas* 
and click the name of the workpad to test things out.

. Try changing the color palette. Click the Back button in your 
browser to undo your change.

. Try dragging the chart around the page. Grab the resize handles to make 
the chart bigger and smaller.

. Now click somewhere off of the element, but not on another element, 
to deselect it. 
+
You will notice a change in the sidebar menu. When no element is selected, you have 
access to the page and workpad-level settings. Feel free to change the page 
background color or rename the workpad.
