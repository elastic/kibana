The easiest way to "get started" with {kib} is to use our {es} Service. The Elasticsearch Service is available on AWS, GCP, and Azure, and automatically configures {kib} to work with {es}.

[[hosted-elasticsearch-service]]
== Hosted {es} Service

Skip managing your own Kibana installation by using our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud.

Try out the Elasticsearch Service for free, and then begin configuring your own user settings right in the Elasticsearch Service Console. Any changes are automatically changed in the kibana.yml configuration file. For detailed information about the kibana.yml settings, refer to <<settings, Configure {kib}>>.

[[install-and-manage-the-stack-yourself]]
== Install and manage the Elastic Stack yourself

If youâ€™d rather install the Elastic Stack yourself, review the Elastic Support Matrix for information about supported operating systems and product compatibility.

We recommend you use the same version of Elasticsearch and Kibana.

//[insert image]

. To install the Elastic Stack, go to Getting started with the Elastic Stack.

. Download and install Kibana.

1. 
Install on-prem
** Install {kib}
** Start {kib}

Install with Cloud
* Set up on Cloud

2. 
* Configure the kibana.yml settings (optional for Cloud deployments)
* Securing access to Kibana
* Configure security

* Configure reporting (Only necessary if you want to share your findings)
* Configure monitoring (Only necessary if you want to look at stats for the Stack)

[[supported-platforms]]
[float]
== Supported platforms

Packages of Kibana are provided for and tested against Linux, Darwin, and
Windows. Since Kibana runs on Node.js, we include the necessary Node.js
binaries for these platforms. Running Kibana against a separately maintained
version of Node.js is not supported.

[float]
[[elasticsearch-version]]
== Elasticsearch version

Kibana should be configured to run against an Elasticsearch node of the same
version. This is the officially supported configuration.

Running different major version releases of Kibana and Elasticsearch (e.g.
Kibana 5.x and Elasticsearch 2.x) is not supported, nor is running a minor
version of Kibana that is newer than the version of Elasticsearch (e.g. Kibana
5.1 and Elasticsearch 5.0).

Running a minor version of Elasticsearch that is higher than Kibana will
generally work in order to facilitate an upgrade process where Elasticsearch
is upgraded first (e.g. Kibana 5.0 and Elasticsearch 5.1). In this
configuration, a warning will be logged on Kibana server startup, so it's only
meant to be temporary until Kibana is upgraded to the same version as
Elasticsearch.

Running different patch version releases of Kibana and Elasticsearch (e.g.
Kibana 5.0.0 and Elasticsearch 5.0.1) is generally supported, though we
encourage users to run the same versions of Kibana and Elasticsearch down to
the patch version.
