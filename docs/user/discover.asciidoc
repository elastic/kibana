Use *Discover* to drill down into and understand your data, so you can determine the best way 
to visualize it. This saves you time
in creating your visualizations and helps you build better dashboards.

With *Discover*, you can:

* Access every document in every index that matches the selected index pattern
* Search your data and filter the search results
* Get field-level details about the documents that match your search
* View what events occurred just before and after a document


[float]
=== Set up your index pattern 

The first thing to do in *Discover* is to select an <<index-patterns, index pattern>>
to define the data to work with. The current index pattern and options for 
changing it are in the upper left.
If you haven't yet created an index pattern, you can download a <<add-sample-data, sample data set>>, 
which has pre-built index patterns. 

[float]
=== Set a time filter

By default, *Discover* shows data for the last 15 minutes.
If you have a time-based index, and no data displays,
you might need to increase the time range. Using the <<set-time-filter, time filter>> in the upper right,
you can specify a common or recently-used time range, a relative time
from now, or an absolute time range.

[float]
=== Search your data

You have your data, and now you start asking questions about it. 
You can search for insights into your data using the <<kuery-query, Kibana Query language>>,
which offers a simplified query syntax that allows boolean operators, wildcards, and field filtering. 
For example, if 
you search for `day_of_week : Friday`, you'll get a list of all documents 
in which `day_of_week` is set to `Friday`. If you prefer 
Lucene query syntax, you can switch to it using the KQL menu. 

To save a search, so you can use it in visualizations and dashboards,
click *Save* in the menu bar. You can open a saved search at any time
by clicking *Open*.

[float]
=== Filter by field

You can filter your search results to find exactly what you want.
When you click on a name in the field list, you'll see 
the top five values for the field, the number of documents that contain the field, 
and the percentage of documents that contain each value. From this view, you can
use the (+) magnifier icon to quickly find all 
documents that have that value or (-) to exclude all 
documents with that value. See <<field-filter, filtering by field>> for more filter options.

[float]
=== View field-level details

Want to view the field-level details? You can expand a document to 
examine its contents either formatted or as JSON.
From the table your, you can further refine your search with a single click.
See <<document-data, Viewing document data>> for more options.

[float]
=== View a document in context

Suppose you're troubleshooting your data, and you've narrowed down your results to a single document.  
Now you want to to see all the documents that occurred just before and after the 
document that you are looking at. You can do that by expanding the document and 
clicking <<document-context, View surrounding documents>>.

[float]
=== Share your search

Finally, its time to share your data.  You can export your data as a CSV filterEditor
or create direct link to share.  The *Share* action is in the menu bar..
