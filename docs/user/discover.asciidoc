**_Tell {kib} where to find your data, then search and filter it for hidden insights and relationships._**

You’ve added your data, and now you’re ready to dig in. You have questions about your data.
What events were logged most recently? What pages on your website contain a
specific word or phrase? What processes on your server take longer than 500 milliseconds to respond?
This tutorial shows you how to use *Discover* to quickly search large amounts of
data and understand what’s going on at any given time.

You’ll learn to:

- **Select** data for your exploration, and then set a time range for that data,
search it with the {kib} Query Language, and filter the results.
- **Explore** the details of your data, view individual documents, and create tables
that summarize the contents of the data.
- **Present** your findings in reports and visualizations.

At the end of this tutorial, you’ll be ready to start exploring with your own
data in *Discover*.

=== Prerequisites

- If you don’t already have {kib}, set it up with https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup?baymax=docs-body&elektra=docs[our free trial].
- You must have data in {es}.  This tutorial uses the
<<gs-get-data-into-kibana,ecommerce sample data set>>, but you can use your own data.
- You should have an understanding of {ref}/documents-indices.html[{es} documents and indices].


[float]
[[whats-you-goal-in-discover]]
=== What’s your goal?

When you start exploring your data in **Discover**, it's common to start with one or two goals:

- **Get an overview of what is happening.**
For example, you might look for
information on the overall health and performance of your ecommerce business.
You want to periodically gather the data and then generate a report that you can share.

- **Find an answer to a specific question.** You want
to dig into your ecommerce data to
determine which products, in what locations, and what day of the week to target your ads. You want to visualize
this data and present it to your marketing team.

[float]
[[find-the-data-you-want-to-use]]
=== Step 1. Find the data you want to use

Tell {kib} where to find your data, then specify the time range in which to view that data.

. Open the main menu, and select **Discover**.

. Select the data you want to work with by choosing an index pattern.
+
{kib} requires an <<index-patterns,index pattern>> to tell it which {es} indices you want to work with.
To view the ecommerce sample data, make sure the index pattern is set to **kibana_sample_data_ecommerce**.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/discover-index-pattern.png[How to set the index pattern in Discover]

. Adjust the time range to view data for the *Last 7 days*.
+
NOTE: The range selection is based on the default time field in your data.
If you are using the sample data, this value was set when you added the data.
If you  are using your own data, and it does not have a time field, the range selection is not available.

. To view the count of documents for a given time in the specified range,
click and drag the mouse over the histogram, and then click *Refresh*.

[float]
[[explore-fields-in-your-data]]
=== Step 2. Explore the fields in your data

**Discover** includes a table that shows all the documents that match your search.
By default, the table includes columns for the time field and the document `_source`.
You’ll modify this table to display only your fields of interest.

. Scan through the list of **Available fields** to see
what’s in your data. You can also search for a field by name.

. Find the `manufacturer` field, and then click it to view the five most popular values for that field.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/filter-field.png[Fields list that displays the top five search results]

. Click image:images/add-icon.png[Add icon] to toggle the field into the document table.

. Add `geoip.country_iso_code` and `day of week` so your document table looks like this:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/document-table.png[Document table with fields for manufacturer, geo.country_iso_code, and day_of_week]

. To rearrange the table columns, hover the mouse over a
column header, and then use the move and sort controls.

[float]
[[search-in-discover]]
=== Step 3. Search your data

One of the unique capabilities of **Discover** is the ability to combine
free text search with filtering based on structured data.
To search all fields, enter a simple string in the **Search** field. To search particular fields and
build more complex queries, use the <<kuery-query,Kibana Query language>>.
As you type, KQL prompts you with the fields you can search and the operators
you can use to build a structured query.

To search the ecommerce data for documents where the country matches US:

. Enter `g`, and then select *geoip.country_iso_code*.
. Select *equals some value* and *US*, and then click *Update*.
. For a more complex search, try:
+
`geoip.country_iso_code : US and products.taxless_price >= 75`

[float]
[[filter-in-discover]]
=== Step 4. Filter your data

Whereas the query defines the set of documents you are interested in,
filters enable you to zero in on different subsets of those documents.
You can filter results to include or exclude specific fields,
filter by data type, filter for a value in a range, and more.

To exclude documents when day of week is Wednesday:

. Click **Add filter**.
. Set **Field** to *day_of_week*, **Operator** to *is not*, and **Value** to *Wednesday*.
. Save the filter.
. Continue your exploration by adding more filters.
. To remove a filter,
click the close icon (x) next to its name in the filter bar.

[float]
[[look-inside-a-document]]
=== Step 5.  Look inside a document

Dive into an individual document and view the documents
that occurred before and after it.

. In the document table, expand any document.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/document-table-expanded.png[Table view with document expanded]

. Scan through the fields and their values. If you find a field of interest,
hover of its name for filters and other controls.

. To view documents that occurred before or after the event you are looking at, click **View surrounding documents**.

. To view document data as a separate page, click **View single document**.
+
For direct access to a particular document, you can bookmark and share the document link.

[float]
[[save-your-search]]
=== Step 6.  Save your search for later use

Save your search so you can repeat it later, generate a CSV report, or use it in visualizations, dashboards, and Canvas workpads.
Saving a search saves the query and the filters.

. In the toolbar, click **Save**.

. Give your search a title, and then click **Save**.

[float]
[[share-findings-in-a-report]]
=== Step 7. Share your findings in a report

Export your data into a spreadsheet.

. In the toolbar, click **Share**, then **CSV Reports**.

. Click **Generate CSV**.
+
Your report is available in **Stack Management > Reporting**.

[float]
=== Step 8. Visualize your findings
If a field can be {ref}/search-aggregations.html[aggregated], you can quickly
visualize it from **Discover**.

. From the **Available fields** list, click  `day_of_week`, and then click **Visualize**.
+
{kib} creates a visualization best suited for this field.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/visualize-from-discover.png[Visualization that opens from Discover based on your data]

. Customize the visualization and then save it for use in a dashboard or Canvas workpad.

[float]
=== What’s next?

There’s much more you can do with your data.


* <<kuery-query, Get examples of KQL queries>> that you can try.

* <<kibana-discover-settings, Configure Discover>> to better meet your needs.
In **Advanced Settings**, you can configure the number of documents to show,
the columns that display by default, and more.

* <<dashboard,Create a dashboard>> with even more awesome visualizations, like treemaps, metrics, and tables.
