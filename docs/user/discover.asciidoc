Use *Discover* to drill down into and understand your data, so you can determine the best way 
to visualize it. This saves you time
in creating your visualizations and helps you build better dashboards.

With *Discover*, you can:

* Access every document in every index that matches the selected index pattern
* Submit search queries and filter the search results
* Get field-level details about the documents that match your search
* View what occurred just before and after an event


[float]
=== Set up your index pattern 

The first thing to do in *Discover* is to select an <<index-patterns, index pattern>>
to define the data to work with. The current index pattern and options for 
changing it are in the upper left.
If you haven't yet created an index pattern, try downloading a <<add-sample-data, sample data set>>, 
which has pre-built index patterns. 

[float]
=== Set a time filter

By default, *Discover* shows data for the last 15 minutes.
If you have a time-based index, and no data displays,
you might need to increase the time range. Use the <<set-time-filter, time filter>> in the upper right
to specify a common or recently-used time range, a relative time
from now, or an absolute time range.

[float]
=== Search your data

To search your data,
enter your search criteria in the query bar.
By default, you'll use the <<kuery-query, Kibana Query language>>,
which offers a simplified query syntax and autocomplete. 
For example, if 
you search for `day_of_week : Friday`, you'll get a list of all documents 
in which `day_of_week` is set to `Friday`. 

To save a search, so you can use it in visualizations and dashboards,
click *Save* in the menu bar. You can open the search at a later date by clicking *Open*.

[float]
=== Filter by field

If you click on a name in the field list, you'll see 
the top five values for the field, the number of documents that contain the field, 
and the percentage of documents that contain each value. From this view, you can
use the (+) magnifier icon to quickly filter for all 
documents that have that value or (-) to exclude all 
documents with that value. See <<field-filter, filtering by field>> for more filter options.

[float]
=== Modify the document table

Most likely, you're only interested in some of the fields of each document. 
You can add fields add and remove fields from the document table
by clicking *add* or *remove* next to the field 
name in field list. 
See <<document-data, Viewing document data>> for details.

[float]
=== View a document in context

Suppose you're troubleshooting your data, and you've narrowed down your results to a single document.  
Now you want to to see all the documents that occurred just before and after the 
document that you are looking at. You can do that by expanding the document and 
clicking <<document-context, View surrounding documents>>.
