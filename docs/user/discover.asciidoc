When you know what your data includes, you can create visualizations
that best display that data and build better dashboards.
*Discover* enables you to explore your data, find
hidden insights and relationships, and get answers to your questions.

With *Discover*, you can:

* Access every document in every index that matches your selected index pattern
* Search your data and filter the search results
* Get field-level details about the documents that match your search
* View the events that occurred just before and after a document

[float]
=== Set up your index pattern

The first thing to do in *Discover* is to select an <<index-patterns, index pattern>>, which
defines the data you want to explore and visualize. The current index pattern is in the upper left.
If you haven't yet created an index pattern, you can add a <<add-sample-data, sample data set>>,
which has a pre-built index pattern.

[float]
=== Set a time filter

By default, *Discover* shows data for the last 15 minutes.
If you have a time-based index, and no data displays,
you might need to increase the time range. Using the <<set-time-filter, time filter>> in the upper right,
you can specify a common or recently-used time range, a relative time
from now, or an absolute time range.

[float]
=== Search your data

Now that you have your data and set the time span, you can start asking your questions.
You can search your data using the <<kuery-query, Kibana Query language>>,
which offers a simplified query syntax.
For example, if
you search for `day_of_week : Friday`, you'll get a list of all documents
in which `day_of_week` is set to `Friday`. If you prefer
<<lucene-query, Lucene query syntax>>, you can access it from the KQL menu.

[float]
=== Filter your search results

Next, you'll want narrow your search results to a more manageable data set.
When you click on a name in the field list, you'll see
the top five values for the field, the number of documents that contain the field,
and the percentage of documents that contain each value. From this view, you can
use the (+) magnifier icon to quickly find all
documents that have that value, or (-) to exclude all
documents with that value. For more filter options, see <<field-filter, filtering by field>>.

[float]
=== Add and remove fields

The sortable documents table
lists the documents that match your search.
By default, the table includes columns for the time field and the document `_source`.
To zero in on a specific field, click *add* next to the field name in the left sidebar.
For example, if you add the `currency`, `customer_last_name`, and `day_of_week` fields,
the document table includes columns for those three fields.

[float]
=== Examine document contents

From the documents table, you can expand a document to
examine its field data in either table or JSON format.
The table view provides yet another filtering option&mdash;filtering for whether the field
is present.  See <<document-data, Viewing document data>> for details.

[float]
=== View a document in context

Suppose you're troubleshooting your data, and you've narrowed down your results to a single document.
Now you want to to see the events that occurred just before and after the
document that you are looking at. You can do that by expanding the document and
clicking <<document-context, View surrounding documents>>.

[float]
=== Save and share your search

Finally, its time to save and share your data.  You can export your data as a CSV file
or create a direct link to share.  The *Save* and *Share* actions are in the menu bar.
