Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) provide encryption for data-in-transit. While these terms are often used
interchangeably, {kib} supports only TLS, which supersedes the old SSL protocols.

Browsers send traffic to {kib} and {kib} sends traffic to {es}. These communication channels are configured separately to use TLS.

TLS requires X.509 certificates to authenticate the communicating parties and perform encryption of data-in-transit. Each certificate
contains a public key and has an associated -- but separate -- private key; these keys are used for cryptographic operations. {kib}
supports certificates and private keys in PEM or PKCS#12 format.

See {ref}/security-basic-setup-https.html[Set up basic security for the Elastic Stack] to encrypt HTTP communications for {es} and {kib}.
