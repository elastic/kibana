=== API Keys


API keys are security mechanisms used to authenticate and authorize access to {es} resources. They ensure that only authorized users or applications interact with {es}.

For example, if you extract data from an {es} cluster on a daily basis, you might create an API key tied to your credentials, configure it with minimum access, and then put the API credentials into a cron job. Or you might create API keys to automate ingestion of new data from remote sources, without a live user interaction.

You can use {kib} to manage your different API keys:

* Personal API key: allows external services to access the Elastic Stack on behalf of a user.
* Cross-Cluster API key: allows remote clusters to connect to your local cluster.
* Managed API key: created and managed by Kibana to correctly run background tasks.

To manage API keys, open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Security > API Keys*.

[[view-api-keys]]
=== View and delete API keys

The *API Keys* feature in {kib} lists your API keys, including the name, date created, and status. If an API key expires, its status changes from `Active` to `Expired`.

If you have `manage_security` or `manage_api_key` permissions, you can view the API keys of all users, and see which API key was created by which user in which realm.
If you have only the `manage_own_api_key` permission, you see only a list of your own keys.

You can delete API keys individually or in bulk, but you need the `manage_api_keys` or `manage_own_api_key` privileges.
