[[api-keys]]
=== API Keys


API keys enable you to create secondary credentials so that you can send
requests on behalf of the user. Secondary credentials have
the same or lower access rights.

For example, if you extract data from an {es} cluster on a daily
basis, you might create an API key tied to your credentials,
configure it with minimum access,
and then put the API credentials into a cron job.
Or, you might create API keys to automate ingestion of new data from
remote sources, without a live user interaction.

You can create API keys from the {kib} Console. To view and invalidate 
API keys, open the menu, then go to *Stack Management > Security > API Keys*.

[[api-keys-service]]
=== {es} API key service

The {es} API key service is automatically enabled when you configure
{ref}/configuring-tls.html#tls-http[TLS on the HTTP interface].
This ensures that clients are unable to send API keys in clear-text.

When HTTPS connections are not enabled between {kib} and {es},
you cannot create or manage API keys, and you get an error message.
For more information, see the
{ref}/security-api-create-api-key.html[{es} API key documentation],
or contact your system administrator.

[[api-keys-security-privileges]]
=== Security privileges

You must have the `manage_security`, `manage_api_key`, or the `manage_own_api_key` 
cluster privileges to use API keys in {kib}. To manage roles, open the menu, then go to 
*Stack Management > Security > Roles*, or use the <<role-management-api, {kib} Role Management API>>.

[[create-api-key]]
=== Create an API key
You can {ref}/security-api-create-api-key.html[create an API key] from
the {kib} Console. This example shows how to create an API key
to authenticate to a <<api, Kibana API>>.

[source,js]
POST /_security/api_key
{
  "name": "kibana_api_key",
}

This creates an API key with the
name `kibana_api_key`. API key
names must be globally unique.
An expiration date is optional and follows
{ref}/common-options.html#time-units[{es} time unit format].
When an expiration is not provided, the API key does not expire.

The response should look something like this:

[source,js]
{
  "id" : "XFcbCnIBnbwqt2o79G4q",
  "name" : "kibana_api_key",
  "api_key" : "FD6P5UA4QCWlZZQhYF3YGw"
}

Now, you can use the API key to request {kib} roles. You will need
to base64-encode the `id` and `api_key` provided in the response
and add it to your request as an authorization header. For example:

[source,js]
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:5601/api/security/role' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
--header 'kbn-xsrf: true' \
--header 'Authorization: ApiKey aVZlLUMzSUJuYndxdDJvN0k1bU46aGxlYUpNS2lTa2FKeVZua1FnY1VEdw==' \

[float]
[[view-api-keys]]
=== View and invalidate API keys
The *API Keys* feature in Kibana lists your API keys, including the name, date created,
and expiration date. If an API key expires, its status changes from `Active` to `Expired`.

If you have `manage_security` or `manage_api_key` permissions,
you can view the API keys of all users, and see which API key was
created by which user in which realm.
If you have only the `manage_own_api_key` permission, you see only a list of your own keys.

You can invalidate API keys individually or in bulk.
Invalidated keys are deleted in batch after seven days.

[role="screenshot"]
image:user/security/api-keys/images/api-key-invalidate.png["API Keys invalidate"]

You cannot modify an API key. If you need additional privileges,
you must create a new key with the desired configuration and invalidate the old key.
