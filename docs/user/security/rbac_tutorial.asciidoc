=== Tutorial:  Use role-based access control to customize Kibana spaces

With role-based access control (RBAC), you can provide users access to data, tools,
and Kibana spaces.  In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure roles
that provide the right users with the right access to the data, tools, and
Kibana spaces.

==== Scenario

Our user is a web developer working on a bank's
online mortgage service.  The web developer has these 
three requirements:

* Have access to the data for that service 
* Build visualizations and dashboards
* Monitor the performance of the system

You'll provide the web developer with the access and privileges to get the job done.

==== Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need the following:

*  You must have a role that grants privileges to create a space, role, and user. See the {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in] roles.
*  A **space**: In this tutorial use `Dev Mortgage` as the space 
name. See <<spaces-managing, view, create, and delete spaces>> for 
details on creating a space.
*  **Data**:  You can use <<tutorial-sample-data, sample data>> or 
live data.  In the steps below, Filebeat and Metricbeat data are used.

==== Steps

With the requirements in mind, here are the steps that you will work 
through in this tutorial:

* Create a role named `mortgage-developer`
* Give the role the ability to monitor the Elastic Stack
* Give the role permission to access the data in the relevant indices
* Give the role permission to create visualizations and dashboards 
* Create the web developer's user account with the proper roles

==== Create a role

Go to **Management > Roles** 
for an overview of your roles.  This view provides actions
for you to create, edit, and delete roles.

You can create as many roles as you like. Click *Create role* and 
provide a name. Use `dev-mortgage` because this role is for a developer 
working on the bank's mortgage application.

==== Give the role the ability to monitor the Elastic Stack

Stack monitoring is an important feature for system admins and developers.  
Both of these groups use stack monitoring to look at 
performance.  Developers also use stack monitoring to evaluate and tune ingest pipelines.  For more information on stack monitoring see the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/monitoring-overview.html[monitoring overview].

Stack monitoring is a cluster level privilege, so in *Cluster 
privileges*, select  **monitor**

==== Give the role permission to access the data

Access to data in indices is an index level privilege, so in 
*Index privileges*, add lines for the indices that contain the 
data for this role.  Two privileges needed: `read` and 
`view_index_metadata`.  All privileges are detailed in the 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html[security privileges] documentaion.
In the screenshots, Filebeat and Metricbeat data is used, but you 
should use the index patterns for your indices.

==== Give the role permission to create visualizations and dashboards

By default, roles do not give Kibana privileges.  Click **Add space 
privilege** and associate this role with the `Dev Mortgage` space.

To enable users with the `dev-mortgage` role to create visualizations 
and dashboards, click *All* for *Visualize* and *Dashboard*. Also 
assign *All* for *Discover* because it is common for developers 
to create saved searches while designing visualizations.

==== Create the developer's user account with the proper roles

Go to **Management > Users** and click on **Create user** to create a 
user.  Give the user the `dev-mortgage` role 
and the `monitoring-user` role, which is required for users of **Stack Monitoring**.

Finally, have the developer log in and access the Dev Mortgage space 
and create a new visualization.
