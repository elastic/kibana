=== Tutorial: Use role-based access control to customize Kibana spaces

With role-based access control (RBAC), you can provide users access to data, tools,
and Kibana spaces.  In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure roles
that provide the right users with the right access to the data, tools, and
Kibana spaces.

==== Scenario

Our user is a web developer working on a bank's
online mortgage service.  The web developer has these
three requirements:

* Have access to the data for that service
* Build visualizations and dashboards
* Monitor the performance of the system

You'll provide the web developer with the access and privileges to get the job done.

==== Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need the following:

*  **Administrative privileges**: You must have a role that grants privileges to create a space, role, and user. This is any role which grants the `manage_security` cluster privilege. By default, the `superuser` role provides this access. See the {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in] roles.
*  **A space**: In this tutorial, use `Dev Mortgage` as the space
name. See <<spaces-managing, spaces management>> for
details on creating a space.
*  **Data**:  You can use <<tutorial-sample-data, sample data>> or
live data.  In the following steps, Filebeat and Metricbeat data are used.

==== Steps

With the requirements in mind, here are the steps that you will work
through in this tutorial:

* Create a role named `mortgage-developer`
* Give the role permission to access the data in the relevant indices
* Give the role permission to create visualizations and dashboards
* Create the web developer's user account with the proper roles

==== Create a role

Open the menu, then go to *Stack Management > Security > Roles*
for an overview of your roles.  This view provides actions
for you to create, edit, and delete roles.

You can create as many roles as you like. Click *Create role* and
provide a name. Use `dev-mortgage` because this role is for a developer
working on the bank's mortgage application.

==== Give the role permission to access the data

Access to data in indices is an index-level privilege, so in
*Index privileges*, add lines for the indices that contain the
data for this role.  Two privileges are required: `read` and
`view_index_metadata`.  All privileges are detailed in the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html[security privileges] documentation.

In the screenshots, Filebeat and Metricbeat data is used, but you
should use the index patterns for your indices.

==== Give the role permission to create visualizations and dashboards

By default, roles do not give Kibana privileges.  Click **Add space
privilege** and associate this role with the `Dev Mortgage` space.

To enable users with the `dev-mortgage` role to create visualizations
and dashboards, click *All* for *Visualize* and *Dashboard*. Also
assign *All* for *Discover* because it is common for developers
to create saved searches while designing visualizations.

==== Create the developer user account with the proper roles

. Open the menu, then go to *Stack Management > Users*.
. Click **Create user**, then give the user the `dev-mortgage`
and `monitoring-user` roles, which are required for *Stack Monitoring* users.

Finally, have the developer log in and access the Dev Mortgage space
and create a new visualization.

NOTE: If the user is assigned to only one space, they will automatically enter that space on login.
