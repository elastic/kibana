=== Role mappings

Role mappings allow you to describe which roles to assign to your users
using a set of rules. Role mappings are required when authenticating via
an external identity provider, such as Active Directory, Kerberos, PKI, OIDC,
or SAML.

Role mappings have no effect for users inside the `native` or `file` realms.

To manage your role mappings, open the menu, then go to *Stack Management > Security > Role Mappings*.

With *Role mappings*, you can:

* View your configured role mappings
* Create/Edit/Delete role mappings

=== Create a role mapping

. Open the menu, then go to *Stack Management > Security > Role Mappings*.
. Click *Create role mapping*.
. Give your role mapping a unique name, and choose which roles you wish to assign to your users.
+
If you need more flexibility, you can use {ref}/security-api-put-role-mapping.html#_role_templates[role templates] instead.
. Define the rules describing which users should receive the roles you defined. Rules can optionally grouped and nested, allowing for sophisticated logic to suite complex requirements.
. View the {ref}/role-mapping-resources.html[role mapping resources for an overview of the allowed rule types].

=== Example

Let's create a `sales-users` role mapping, which assigns a `sales` role to users whose username
starts with `sls_`, *or* belongs to the `executive` group.

First, we give the role mapping a name, and assign the `sales` role:

Next, we define the two rules, making sure to set the group to *Any are true*:

Click *Save role mapping* once you're finished.
