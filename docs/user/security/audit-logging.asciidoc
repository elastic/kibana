=== Audit logs

You can enable auditing to keep track of security-related events such as
authorization success and failures. Logging these events enables you
to monitor {kib} for suspicious activity and provides evidence in the
event of an attack.

Use the {kib} audit logs in conjunction with {es}'s
audit logging to get a holistic view of all security related events. 
{kib} defers to {es}'s security model for authentication, data
index authorization, and features that are driven by cluster-wide privileges.
For more information on enabling audit logging in {es}, see
{ref}/auditing.html[Auditing security events].

[IMPORTANT]
============================================================================
Audit logs are **disabled** by default. To enable this functionality, you
must set `xpack.security.audit.enabled` to `true` in `kibana.yml`.
============================================================================

Audit logging uses the standard {kib} logging output, which can be configured
in the `kibana.yml` and is discussed in <<settings>>.

==== Audit event types

When you are auditing security events, each request can generate 
multiple audit events. The following is a list of the events that can be generated:

|======
| `saved_objects_authorization_success`    | Logged when a user is authorized to access a saved
                                             objects when using a role with <<kibana-privileges>>
| `saved_objects_authorization_failure`    | Logged when a user isn't authorized to access a saved
                                             objects when using a role with <<kibana-privileges>>
|======

==== ECS audit events

beta[]

[IMPORTANT]
============================================================================
The following events are only logged if the new audit logger (beta) is enabled, by setting the `xpack.security.audit.appender` option, as shown in <<audit-logging-settings>>.
============================================================================

Below is a list of events that can be logged for auditing purposes. 

Each event is broken down into `category`, `type`, `action` and `outcome` fields to make it easy to filter, query and aggregate the resulting logs. 

[NOTE]
============================================================================
To ensure that a record of every operation is persisted even in case of an unexpected error, asynchronous write operations are logged immediately after all authorisation checks have passed, but before the response is received. Please consult the corresponding Elasticsearch logs to see potential write errors.
