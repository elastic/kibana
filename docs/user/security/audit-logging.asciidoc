=== Audit logs

You can enable auditing to keep track of security-related events such as
authorization success and failures. Logging these events enables you to monitor
{kib} for suspicious activity and provides evidence in the event of an attack.

Use the {kib} audit logs in conjunction with {ref}/enable-audit-logging.html[{es} audit logging] to get a
holistic view of all security related events. {kib} defers to the {es} security
model for authentication, data index authorization, and features that are driven
by cluster-wide privileges. For more information on enabling audit logging in
{es}, refer to {ref}/auditing.html[Auditing security events].

[IMPORTANT]
============================================================================
Audit logs are **disabled** by default. To enable this functionality, you must
set `xpack.security.audit.enabled` to `true` in `kibana.yml`.
============================================================================

The current version of the audit logger uses the standard {kib} logging output,
which can be configured in `kibana.yml`. For more information, refer to <<settings>>.
The audit logger uses a separate logger and can be configured using
the options in <<audit-logging-settings>>. 

==== Audit event types

When you are auditing security events, each request can generate multiple audit
events. The following is a list of the events that can be generated:

|======
| `saved_objects_authorization_success`    | Logged when a user is authorized to access a saved
                                             objects when using a role with <<kibana-privileges>>
| `saved_objects_authorization_failure`    | Logged when a user isn't authorized to access a saved
                                             objects when using a role with <<kibana-privileges>>
|======

[[xpack-security-ecs-audit-logging]]
==== ECS audit events

[IMPORTANT]
============================================================================
The following events are only logged if the ECS audit logger is enabled.
For information on how to configure `xpack.security.audit.appender`, refer to
<<ecs-audit-logging-settings>>.
============================================================================

Refer to the table of events that can be logged for auditing purposes. 

Each event is broken down into <<field-event-category, category>>, <<field-event-type, type>>, <<field-event-action, action>> and
<<field-event-outcome, outcome>> fields to make it easy to filter, query and aggregate the resulting logs. The <<field-trace-id, trace.id>>
field can be used to correlate multiple events that originate from the same request.

Refer to <<xpack-security-ecs-audit-schema>> for a table of fields that get logged with audit event. 

[NOTE]
============================================================================
To ensure that a record of every operation is persisted even in case of an
unexpected error, asynchronous write operations are logged immediately after all
authorization checks have passed, but before the response from {es} is received.
Refer to the corresponding {es} logs for potential write errors.

[[xpack-security-ecs-audit-correlation]]
==== Correlating ECS audit events

Audit events can be correlated in two ways:

1. Multiple {kib} audit events that resulted from the same request can be correlated together.
2. If {ref}/enable-audit-logging.html[{es} audit logging] is enabled, {kib} audit events from one request can be correlated with backend
   calls that create {es} audit events.

NOTE: The examples below are simplified, many fields have been omitted and values have been shortened for clarity.

===== Example 1: correlating multiple {kib} audit events

When "thom" creates a new alerting rule, five audit events are written:

[source,json]
-------------
{"event":{"action":"http_request","category":["web"],"outcome":"unknown"},"http":{"request":{"method":"post"}},"url":{"domain":"localhost","path":"/api/alerting/rule","port":5601,"scheme":"https"},"user":{"name":"thom","roles":["superuser"]},"kibana":{"space_id":"default","session_id":"3dHCZRB..."},"@timestamp":"2022-01-25T13:05:34.449-05:00","message":"User is requesting [/api/alerting/rule] endpoint","trace":{"id":"e300e06..."}}
{"event":{"action":"space_get","category":["database"],"type":["access"],"outcome":"success"},"kibana":{"space_id":"default","session_id":"3dHCZRB...","saved_object":{"type":"space","id":"default"}},"user":{"name":"thom","roles":["superuser"]},"@timestamp":"2022-01-25T13:05:34.454-05:00","message":"User has accessed space [id=default]","trace":{"id":"e300e06..."}}
{"event":{"action":"connector_get","category":["database"],"type":["access"],"outcome":"success"},"kibana":{"space_id":"default","session_id":"3dHCZRB...","saved_object":{"type":"action","id":"5e3b1ae..."}},"user":{"name":"thom","roles":["superuser"]},"@timestamp":"2022-01-25T13:05:34.948-05:00","message":"User has accessed connector [id=5e3b1ae...]","trace":{"id":"e300e06..."}}
{"event":{"action":"connector_get","category":["database"],"type":["access"],"outcome":"success"},"kibana":{"space_id":"default","session_id":"3dHCZRB...","saved_object":{"type":"action","id":"5e3b1ae..."}},"user":{"name":"thom","roles":["superuser"]},"@timestamp":"2022-01-25T13:05:34.956-05:00","message":"User has accessed connector [id=5e3b1ae...]","trace":{"id":"e300e06..."}}
{"event":{"action":"rule_create","category":["database"],"type":["creation"],"outcome":"unknown"},"kibana":{"space_id":"default","session_id":"3dHCZRB...","saved_object":{"type":"alert","id":"64517c3..."}},"user":{"name":"thom","roles":["superuser"]},"@timestamp":"2022-01-25T13:05:34.956-05:00","message":"User is creating rule [id=64517c3...]","trace":{"id":"e300e06..."}}
-------------

All of these audit events can be correlated together by the same `trace.id` value `"e300e06..."`. The first event is the HTTP API call, the
next audit events are checks to validate the space and the connectors, and the last audit event is the actual rule creation.

===== Example 2: correlating a {kib} audit event with {es} audit events

When "thom" logs in, a "user_login" {kib} audit event is written:

[source,json]
-------------
{"event":{"action":"user_login","category":["authentication"],"outcome":"success"},"user":{"name":"thom","roles":["superuser"]},"@timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:39.267-05:00","message":"User [thom] has logged in using basic provider [name=basic]","trace":{"id":"818cbf3..."}}
-------------

The `trace.id` value `"818cbf3..."` in the {kib} audit event can be correlated with the `opaque_id` value in these six {es} audit events:

[source,json]
-------------
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,604-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"thom", "user.roles":["superuser"], "request.id":"YCx8wxs...", "action":"cluster:admin/xpack/security/user/authenticate", "request.name":"AuthenticateRequest", "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,613-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"kibana_system", "user.roles":["kibana_system"], "request.id":"Ksx73Ad...", "action":"indices:data/write/index", "request.name":"IndexRequest", "indices":[".kibana_security_session_1"], "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,613-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"kibana_system", "user.roles":["kibana_system"], "request.id":"Ksx73Ad...", "action":"indices:data/write/bulk", "request.name":"BulkRequest", "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,613-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"kibana_system", "user.roles":["kibana_system"], "request.id":"Ksx73Ad...", "action":"indices:data/write/bulk[s]", "request.name":"BulkShardRequest", "indices":[".kibana_security_session_1"], "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,613-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"kibana_system", "user.roles":["kibana_system"], "request.id":"Ksx73Ad...", "action":"indices:data/write/index:op_type/create", "request.name":"BulkItemRequest", "indices":[".kibana_security_session_1"], "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,613-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"kibana_system", "user.roles":["kibana_system"], "request.id":"Ksx73Ad...", "action":"indices:data/write/bulk[s][p]", "request.name":"BulkShardRequest", "indices":[".kibana_security_session_1"], "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
-------------

The {es} audit events show that "thom" authenticated, then subsequently "kibana_system" created a session for that user.
