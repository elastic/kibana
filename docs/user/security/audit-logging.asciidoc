=== Audit logs

Audit logging is a https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription feature] that you can enable to keep track of security-related events,
such as authorization success and failures. Logging these events enables you to monitor {kib} for suspicious activity and provides evidence
in the event of an attack.

Use the {kib} audit logs in conjunction with {ref}/enable-audit-logging.html[{es} audit logging] to get a
holistic view of all security related events. {kib} defers to the {es} security
model for authentication, data index authorization, and features that are driven
by cluster-wide privileges. For more information on enabling audit logging in
{es}, refer to {ref}/auditing.html[Auditing security events].

[NOTE]
============================================================================
Audit logs are **disabled** by default. To enable this functionality, you must
set `xpack.security.audit.enabled` to `true` in `kibana.yml`, and optionally configure
an <<audit-logging-settings, appender>> to write the audit log to a location of your choosing.
============================================================================

[[xpack-security-ecs-audit-logging]]
==== Audit events

Refer to the table of events that can be logged for auditing purposes. 

Each event is broken down into <<field-event-category, category>>, <<field-event-type, type>>, <<field-event-action, action>> and <<field-event-outcome, outcome>> fields
to make it easy to filter, query and aggregate the resulting logs. 

Refer to <<xpack-security-ecs-audit-schema>> for a table of fields that get logged with audit event. 

[NOTE]
============================================================================
To ensure that a record of every operation is persisted even in case of an
unexpected error, asynchronous write operations are logged immediately after all
authorization checks have passed, but before the response from {es} is received.
Refer to the corresponding {es} logs for potential write errors.
