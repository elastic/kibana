=== Access agreement

Some work environments require you to acknowledge and accept an agreement before you can access {kib}, which can contain sensitive information. The agreement text supports Markdown format and can be specified using the `xpack.security.authc.providers.<provider-type>.<provider-name>.accessAgreement.message` setting.

[NOTE]
============================================================================
You need to acknowledge the access agreement only once per session, and {kib} reports the acknowledgement in the audit logs.
============================================================================

Here is how your `kibana.yml` can look like if you define an access agreement:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.providers:
  basic.basic1:
    order: 0
    accessAgreement:
      message: "**You are accessing a system with a sensitive information** \n\n
                  By logging in, you acknowledge that (shortened ...)"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you authenticate using `basic.basic1`, you'll see the following agreement that you must acknowledge before you can access {kib}:
