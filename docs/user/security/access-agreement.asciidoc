=== Access agreement

Access agreement is a https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription feature] that requires users to acknowledge and accept an
agreement before accessing {kib}. The agreement text supports Markdown format and can be specified using the
`xpack.security.authc.providers.<provider-type>.<provider-name>.accessAgreement.message` setting.

You can specify a default access agreement  using the `xpack.security.accessAgreement.message` setting. 
This message will be used for each provider who doesn't specify an access agreement.

[NOTE]
============================================================================
You need to acknowledge the access agreement only once per session, and {kib} reports the acknowledgement in the audit logs.
============================================================================

Here is an example of defining an access agreement in `kibana.yml`:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.providers:
  basic.basic1:
    order: 0
    accessAgreement:
      message: |
        **You are accessing a system with sensitive information**

        By logging in, you acknowledge that information system usage
        ...(shortened)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you authenticate using `basic.basic1`, you'll see the following agreement that you must acknowledge before you can access {kib}:
