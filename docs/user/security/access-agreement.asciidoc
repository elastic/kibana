=== Access Agreement

Some work environments require you to acknowledge and accept an agreement before accessing a product that may contain sensitive information. You can define such an agreement individually for every authentication provider in {kib} as well. The agreement text supports Markdown format and can be specified using `xpack.security.authc.providers.<provider-type>.<provider-name>.accessAgreement.message` setting.

[NOTE]
============================================================================
Users need to acknowledge access agreement only once per session, and {kib} will record the fact of acknowledgement in the audit logs.
============================================================================

Here is how your `kibana.yml` can look like if you define an access agreement:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.providers:
  basic.basic1:
    order: 0
    accessAgreement:
      message: "**You are accessing a system with a sensitive information** \n\n
                  By logging in, you acknowledge that (shortened ...)"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a result users that authenticated using `basic.basic1` authentication provider will see the following agreement that they have to acknowledge before they can access anything else in {kib}:
