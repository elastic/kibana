=== Granting access to {kib}
The Elastic Stack comes with the `kibana_admin` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role], which you can use to grant access to all {kib} features in all spaces. To grant users access to a subset of spaces or features, you can create a custom role that grants the desired {kib} privileges.

When you assign a user multiple roles, the user receives a union of the roles’ privileges. Therefore, assigning the `kibana_admin` role in addition to a custom role that grants {kib} privileges is ineffective because `kibana_admin` has access to all the features in all spaces.

NOTE: When running multiple tenants of {kib} by changing the `kibana.index` in your `kibana.yml`, you cannot use `kibana_admin` to grant access. You must create custom roles that authorize the user for that specific tenant. Although multi-tenant installations are supported, the recommended approach to securing access to {kib} segments is to grant users access to specific spaces.

=== {kib} role management

To create a role that grants {kib} privileges, open the menu, then click *Stack Management > Roles* and click **Create role**.

==== Required permissions

The `manage_security` cluster privilege is required to access role management.

[[adding_kibana_privileges]]
==== Adding {kib} privileges

To assign {kib} privileges to the role, click **Add {kib} privilege** in the {kib} section.

Open the **Spaces** selection control to specify whether to grant the role access to all spaces *** Global (all spaces)** or one or more individual spaces. If you select *** Global (all spaces)**, you can’t select individual spaces until you clear your selection.

Use the **Privilege** menu to grant access to features. The default is **Custom**, which you can use to grant access to individual features. Otherwise, you can grant read and write access to all current and future features by selecting **All**, or grant read access to all current and future features by selecting **Read**.

When using the **Customize by feature** option, you can choose either **All**, **Read** or **None** for access to each feature. As new features are added to {kib}, roles that use the custom option do not automatically get access to the new features. You must manually update the roles.

NOTE: *{stack-monitor-app}* relies on built-in roles to grant access. When a
user is assigned the appropriate roles, the *{stack-monitor-app}* application is
available; otherwise, it is not visible.

To apply your changes, click **Add {kib} privilege**. The privilege shows up under the {kib} privileges section of the role.

==== Feature availability

Features are available to users when their roles grant access to the features, **and** those features are visible in their current space. The following matrix explains when features are available to users when controlling access via <<spaces-managing, spaces>> and role-based access control:

|===
|**Spaces config** |**Role config** |**Result**

|Feature hidden
|Feature disabled
|Feature not available

|Feature hidden
|Feature enabled
|Feature not available

|Feature visible
|Feature disabled
|Feature not available

|Feature visible
|Feature enabled
|**Feature available**

==== Assigning different privileges to different spaces

Using the same role, it’s possible to assign different privileges to different spaces. After you’ve added privileges, click **Add {kib} privilege**. If you’ve already added privileges for either *** Global (all spaces)** or an individual space, you will not be able to select these in the **Spaces** selection control.

Additionally, if you’ve already assigned privileges at *** Global (all spaces)**, you are only able to assign additional privileges to individual spaces. Similar to the behavior of multiple roles granting the union of all privileges, {kib} privileges are also a union. If you’ve already granted the user the **All** privilege at *** Global (all spaces)**, you’re not able to restrict the role to only the **Read** privilege at an individual space.
