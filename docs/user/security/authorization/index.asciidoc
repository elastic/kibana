=== Granting access to {kib}
The Elastic Stack comes with the `kibana_admin` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role], which you can use to grant access to all {kib} features in all spaces. To grant users access to a subset of spaces or features, you can create a custom role that grants the desired {kib} privileges.

When you assign a user multiple roles, the user receives a union of the roles’ privileges. Therefore, assigning the `kibana_admin` role in addition to a custom role that grants {kib} privileges is ineffective because `kibana_admin` has access to all the features in all spaces.

[[xpack-security-multiple-tenants]]
==== Supporting multiple tenants

There are two approaches to supporting multi-tenancy in {kib}:

1. *Recommended:* Create a space and a limited role for each tenant, and configure each user with the appropriate role. See
<<tutorial-secure-access-to-kibana, Securing access to {kib}>> for more details.
2. deprecated:[7.13.0,"In 8.0 and later, the `kibana.index` setting will no longer be supported."] Set up separate {kib} instances to work
with a single {es} cluster by changing the `kibana.index` setting in your `kibana.yml` file.
+
NOTE: When using multiple {kib} instances this way, you cannot use the `kibana_admin` role to grant access. You must create custom roles
that authorize the user for each specific instance.

Whichever approach you use, be careful when granting cluster privileges and index privileges. Both of these approaches share the same {es}
cluster, and {kib} spaces do not prevent you from granting users of two different tenants access to the same index.

[[kibana-role-management]]
=== {kib} role management

Roles are a collection of privileges that allow you to perform actions in {kib} and {es}. Users are not directly granted privileges, but are instead assigned one or more roles that describe the desired level of access. When you assign a user multiple roles, the user receives a union of the roles’ privileges. This means that you cannot reduce the privileges of a user by assigning them an additional role. You must instead remove or edit one of their existing roles.

To create a role, open the menu, then click *Stack Management > Roles* and click **Create role**.

==== Required permissions

The `manage_security` {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster[cluster privilege] is required to access role management.

[[adding_cluster_privileges]]
==== Cluster privileges

Cluster privileges grant access to monitoring and management features in {es}. They also enable <<management, Stack Management>> capabilities in {kib}.

Refer to {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster[cluster privileges] for a complete description of available options.

[[adding_index_privileges]]
==== Index privileges

Each role can grant access to multiple data indices, and each index can have a different set of privileges.
We recommend granting the `read` and `view_index_metadata` privileges to each index that you expect your users to work with in {kib}.

Refer to {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[index privileges] for a complete description of available options.

Document-level and field-level security affords you even more granularity when it comes to granting access to your data.
With document-level security (DLS), you can write an {es} query to describe which documents this role grants access to.
With field-level security (FLS), you can instruct {es} to grant or deny access to specific fields within each document.

[[index_privilege_example_1]]
===== Example: Grant access to indices that match the `filebeat-*` pattern

. Go to **Stack Management > Roles**, and then click **Create role**.
. In **Index privileges**, enter:
.. `filebeat-*` in the **Index** field.
.. `read` and `view_index_metadata` in the **Privileges** field.

[[index_privilege_dls_example]]
===== Example: Grant read access to specific documents in indices that match the `filebeat-*` pattern

{ref}/document-level-security.html[Document-level security] is a https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription feature].

. Go to **Stack Management > Roles**, and then click **Create role**.
. In **Index privileges**, enter:
.. `filebeat-*` in the **Indices** field.
.. `read` and `view_index_metadata` in the **Privileges** field.
. Select **Grant read privileges to specific documents**.
. Enter an {es} query that matches the documents your users should access. This example writes a query that allows access to documents that have a `category` field equal to `click`:
+
[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "match": {
    "category": "click"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
+
NOTE: {kib} automatically surrounds your DLS query with a `query` block, so you don't have to provide your own.

[[adding_kibana_privileges]]
==== {kib} privileges

To assign {kib} privileges to the role, click **Add {kib} privilege** in the {kib} section.

[role="screenshot"]
image::spaces/images/spaces-roles.png[Add {kib} privileges]

Open the **Spaces** selection control to specify whether to grant the role access to all spaces **All Spaces** or one or more individual spaces. If you select **All Spaces**, you can’t select individual spaces until you clear your selection.

Use the **Privilege** menu to grant access to features. The default is **Custom**, which you can use to grant access to individual features. Otherwise, you can grant read and write access to all current and future features by selecting **All**, or grant read access to all current and future features by selecting **Read**.

When using the **Customize by feature** option, you can choose either **All**, **Read** or **None** for access to each feature. As new features are added to {kib}, roles that use the custom option do not automatically get access to the new features. You must manually update the roles.

NOTE: *{stack-monitor-app}* relies on built-in roles to grant access. When a
user is assigned the appropriate roles, the *{stack-monitor-app}* application is
available; otherwise, it is not visible.

To apply your changes, click **Add {kib} privilege**. The privilege shows up under the {kib} privileges section of the role.

==== Feature availability

Features are available to users when their roles grant access to the features, **and** those features are visible in their current space. The following matrix explains when features are available to users when controlling access via <<spaces-managing, spaces>> and role-based access control:

|===
|**Spaces config** |**Role config** |**Result**

|Feature hidden
|Feature disabled
|Feature not available

|Feature hidden
|Feature enabled
|Feature not available

|Feature visible
|Feature disabled
|Feature not available

|Feature visible
|Feature enabled
|**Feature available**

==== Assigning different privileges to different spaces

Using the same role, it’s possible to assign different privileges to different spaces. After you’ve added privileges, click **Add {kib} privilege**. If you’ve already added privileges for either **All Spaces** or an individual space, you will not be able to select these in the **Spaces** selection control.

Additionally, if you’ve already assigned privileges at **All Spaces**, you are only able to assign additional privileges to individual spaces. Similar to the behavior of multiple roles granting the union of all privileges, {kib} privileges are also a union. If you’ve already granted the user the **All** privilege at **All Spaces**, you’re not able to restrict the role to only the **Read** privilege at an individual space.
