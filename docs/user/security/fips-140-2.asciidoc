=== FIPS 140-2

experimental::[]

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2, (FIPS PUB 140-2), 
titled "Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules" is a U.S. government computer security standard
used to approve cryptographic modules.

{kib} offers a FIPS 140-2 compliant mode and as such can run in a Node.js environment configured with a FIPS 
140-2 compliant OpenSSL3 provider.

To run {kib} in FIPS mode, you must have the appropriate {subscriptions}[subscription].

[IMPORTANT]
============================================================================
The Node bundled with {kib} is not configured for FIPS 140-2. You must configure a FIPS 140-2 compliant OpenSSL3 
provider. Consult the Node.js documentation to learn how to configure your environment.
============================================================================

For {kib}, adherence to FIPS 140-2 is ensured by:

* Using FIPS approved / NIST recommended cryptographic algorithms.

* Delegating the implementation of these cryptographic algorithms to a NIST validated cryptographic module
(available via Node.js configured with an OpenSSL3 provider).

* Allowing the configuration of {kib} in a FIPS 140-2 compliant manner, as documented below. 

==== Configuring {kib} for FIPS 140-2

Apart from setting `xpack.security.experimental.fipsMode.enabled` to `true` in your {kib} config, a number of security related 
settings need to be reviewed and configured in order to run {kib} successfully in a FIPS 140-2 compliant Node.js 
environment.

===== Kibana keystore

FIPS 140-2 (via NIST Special Publication 800-132) dictates that encryption keys should at least have an effective 
strength of 112 bits. As such, the Kibana keystore that stores the applicationâ€™s secure settings needs to be 
password protected with a password that satisfies this requirement. This means that the password needs to be 14 bytes 
long which is equivalent to a 14 character ASCII encoded password, or a 7 character UTF-8 encoded password.

For more information on how to set this password, refer to the <<change-password,keystore documentation>>.

===== TLS keystore and keys

Keystores can be used in a number of General TLS settings in order to conveniently store key and trust material.
PKCS#12 keystores cannot be used in a FIPS 140-2 compliant Node.js environment. Avoid using these types of keystores. 
Your FIPS 140-2 provider may provide a compliant keystore implementation that can be used, or you can use PEM encoded 
files. To use PEM encoded key material, you can use the relevant `\*.key` and `*.certificate` configuration options, 
and for trust material you can use `*.certificate_authorities`.

As an example, avoid PKCS#12 specific settings such as:

* `server.ssl.keystore.path`
* `server.ssl.truststore.path`
* `elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.path`
* `elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path`

===== Limitations

Configuring {kib} to run in FIPS mode is still considered to be experimental. Not all features are guaranteed to
function as expected.
