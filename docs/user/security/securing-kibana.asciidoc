{kib} users have to log in when {stack-security-features} are enabled on your
cluster. You configure roles for your {kib} users to control what data those
users can access.

Most requests made through {kib} to {es} are authenticated by using the
credentials of the logged-in user. There are, however, a few internal requests
that the {kib} server needs to make to the {es} cluster. For this reason, you
must configure credentials for the {kib} server to use for those requests.

With {security-features} enabled, if you load a {kib} dashboard that accesses
data in an index that you are not authorized to view, you get an error that
indicates the index does not exist. The {security-features} do not currently
provide a way to control which users can load which dashboards.

To use {kib} with {security-features}:

. {ref}/configuring-security.html[Configure security in {es}].

. Configure {kib} to use the appropriate built-in user.
+
--
Update the following settings in the `kibana.yml` configuration
file:

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.username: "kibana_system"
elasticsearch.password: "kibanapassword"
-----------------------------------------------

The {kib} server submits requests as this user to access the cluster monitoring
APIs and the `.kibana` index. The server does _not_ need access to user indices.

The password for the built-in `kibana_system` user is typically set as part of
the security configuration process on {es}. For more information, see
{ref}/built-in-users.html[Built-in users].
--

. Set the `xpack.security.encryptionKey` property in the `kibana.yml`
configuration file. You can use any text string that is 32 characters or longer
as the encryption key.
+
--
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.encryptionKey: "something_at_least_32_characters"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For more information, see <<security-settings-kb,Security settings in {kib}>>.
--

. Configure {kib}'s session expiration settings. Set both the idle timeout and lifespan settings:
+
--
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.session.idleTimeout: "1h"
xpack.security.session.lifespan: "30d"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For more information, see <<xpack-security-session-management, Session management in {kib}>>.
--

. Optional: <<configuring-tls,Configure {kib} to encrypt communications>>.

. Optional: <<elasticsearch-mutual-tls,Configure {kib} to authenticate to {es} with a client certificate>>.

. Restart {kib}.

. [[kibana-roles]]Choose an authentication mechanism and grant users the privileges they need to
use {kib}.
+
--
For more information on Basic Authentication and additional methods of
authenticating {kib} users, see <<kibana-authentication>>.

To manage privileges, open the menu, then go to *Stack Management > Security > Roles*.

If you're using the native realm with Basic Authentication, open then menu, 
then go to *Stack Management > Security > Users* to assign roles, or use the
{ref}/security-api.html#security-user-apis[user management APIs]. For example,
the following creates a user named `jacknich` and assigns it the `kibana_admin`
role:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /_security/user/jacknich
{
  "password" : "t0pS3cr3t",
  "roles" : [ "kibana_admin" ]
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
--

. Grant users access to the indices that they will be working with in {kib}.
+
--
TIP: You can define as many different roles for your {kib} users as you need.

For example, create roles that have `read` and `view_index_metadata` privileges
on specific index patterns. For more information, see
{ref}/authorization.html[User authorization].

--

. Verify that you can log in as a user. If you are running
{kib} locally, go to `https://localhost:5601` and enter the credentials for a
user you've assigned a {kib} user role. For example, you could log in as the user
`jacknich`.
+
--

NOTE: This must be a user who has been assigned <<kibana-privileges, Kibana privileges>>.
{kib} server credentials should only be used internally by the {kib} server.
