A {kib} _dashboard_ is a collection of visualizations, searches, and 
maps, typically in real-time. Dashboards provide 
at-a-glance insights into your data and enable you to drill down into details. 

To start working with dashboards, click *Dashboard* in the side navigation. 
With *Dashboard*, you can:

* <<dashboard-create-new-dashboard, Create a dashboard>>
* <<customizing-your-dashboard, Arrange dashboard elements>>
* <<dashboard-customize-filter, Customize time ranges>>
* <<sharing-dashboards, Share a dashboard>>
* <<import-dashboards, Import and export dashboards>>
* <<viewing-detailed-information, Inspect and edit dashboard elements>>

=== [xpack]#Read only access#
If you see
the read-only icon in the application header,
then you don't have sufficient privileges to create and save dashboards. The buttons to create and edit
dashboards are not visible. For more information, see <<xpack-security-authorization>>.

=== Interact with dashboards

When you open *Dashboard*, you're presented an overview of your dashboards. 
If you don't have any dashboards, you can add 
<<add-sample-data, sample data sets>>,
which include pre-built dashboards. 

Once you open a dashboard, you can filter the data
by entering a search query, changing the time filter, or clicking 
in the visualizations, searches, and maps. If a dashboard element has a stored query, 
both queries are applied.

[[dashboard-create-new-dashboard]]
== Create a dashboard

To create a dashboard, you must have data indexed into {es}, an index pattern 
to retrieve the data from {es}, and 
visualizations, saved searches, or maps. If these don't exist, you're prompted to 
add them as you create the dashboard.

For an end-to-end example, see <<tutorial-build-dashboard, Building your own dashboard>>.

. Open *Dashboard.*
. Click *Create new dashboard.*
. Click *Add*.
. Use *Add panels* to add elements to the dashboard.
+
The visualizations, saved searches, and maps
are stored in panels that you can move and resize. A
menu in the upper right of the panel has options for customizing
the panel. You can add elements from 
multiple indices, and the same element can appear in multiple dashboards.

. When you're finished adding and arranging the panels,
*Save* the dashboard.

[[customizing-your-dashboard]]
=== Arrange dashboard elements

In *Edit* mode, you can move, resize, customize, and delete panels to suit your needs. 

[[moving-containers]]
* To move a panel, click and hold the panel header and drag to the new location.

[[resizing-containers]]
* To resize a panel, click the resize control on the lower right and drag
to the new dimensions.

* To toggle the use of margins and panel titles, use the *Options* menu in the upper left.

* To delete a panel, open the panel menu and select *Delete from dashboard.* Deleting a panel from a
dashboard does *not* delete the saved visualization or search.

[[dashboard-customize-filter]]
=== Customize time ranges

You can configure each visualization, saved search, and map on your dashboard
for a specific time range. For example, you might want one visualization to show
the monthly trend for CPU usage and another to show the current CPU usage.   

From the panel menu, select *Customize time range* to expose a time filter 
dedicated to that panel. Panels that are not restricted by a specific 
time range are controlled by the
global time filter.

[[sharing-dashboards]]
=== Share a dashboard

[[embedding-dashboards]]
When you've finished your dashboard, you can share it with your teammates. 
From the *Share* menu, you can:

* Embed the code in a web page. Users must have Kibana access
to view an embedded dashboard.
* Share a direct link to a {kib} dashboard
* Generate a PDF report
* Generate a PNG report

TIP: You can create a link to a dashboard by title by doing this: +
`${domain}/${basepath?}/app/kibana#/dashboards?title=${yourdashboardtitle}`

TIP: When sharing a link to a dashboard snapshot, use the *Short URL*. Snapshot
URLs are long and can be problematic for Internet Explorer and other
tools. To create a short URL, you must have write access to {kib}.

[[import-dashboards]]
=== Import and export dashboards

To import and export dashboards, go to *Management > Saved Objects*. For details,
see <<managing-saved-objects, Managing saved objects>>.

=== Inspect and edit elements

Many dashboard elements allow you to drill down into the data and requests 
behind the element. Open the menu in the upper right of the panel and select *Inspect*. 
The views you see depend on the element that you inspect.

To open an element for editing, put the dashboard in *Edit* mode, 
and then select *Edit* from the panel menu. The changes you make appear in
every dashboard that uses the element.
