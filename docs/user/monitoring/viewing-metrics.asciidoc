=== Viewing monitoring data in {kib}
++++
<titleabbrev>Viewing monitoring data</titleabbrev>
++++

After you collect monitoring data for one or more products in the {stack}, you 
can configure {kib} to retrieve that information and display it in on the 
*Stack Monitoring* page.

At a minimum, you must have monitoring data for the {es} production cluster.
Once that data exists, {kib} can display monitoring data for other products in
the cluster.

. Identify where to retrieve monitoring data from. 
+
--
The cluster that contains the monitoring data is referred to 
as the _monitoring cluster_. 

TIP: If the monitoring data is stored on a *dedicated* monitoring cluster, it is 
accessible even when the cluster you're monitoring is not. If you have at least 
a gold license, you can send data from multiple clusters to the same monitoring 
cluster and view them all through the same instance of {kib}. 

By default, data is retrieved from the cluster specified in the 
`elasticsearch.hosts` value in the `kibana.yml` file. If you want to retrieve it
from a different cluster, set `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts`.

To learn more about typical monitoring architectures, 
see {ref}/how-monitoring-works.html[How monitoring works] and 
{ref}/monitoring-production.html[Monitoring in a production environment].
--

. Verify that `xpack.monitoring.ui.enabled` is set to `true`, which is the
default value, in the `kibana.yml` file. For more information, see 
<<monitoring-settings-kb>>.

. If the Elastic {security-features} are enabled on the monitoring cluster, you 
must provide a user ID and password so {kib} can retrieve the data. 

.. Create a user that has the `monitoring_user` 
{ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role] on the monitoring cluster.

.. Add the `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.username` and 
`xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password` settings in the `kibana.yml` file.
If these settings are omitted, {kib} uses the `elasticsearch.username` and
`elasticsearch.password` setting values. For more 
information, see {kibana-ref}/using-kibana-with-security.html[Configuring security in {kib}].

. (Optional) Configure {kib} to encrypt communications between the {kib} server 
and the monitoring cluster. See <<configuring-tls>>. 

. If the Elastic {security-features} are enabled on the {kib} server, only users 
that have the authority to access {kib} indices and to read the monitoring indices 
can use the monitoring dashboards. 
+
--
NOTE: These users must exist on the monitoring cluster. If you are accessing a 
remote monitoring cluster, you must use credentials that are valid on both the 
{kib} server and the monitoring cluster.

--

.. Create users that have the `monitoring_user` and `kibana_user` 
{ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in roles].

. Open {kib} in your web browser. 
+
--
By default, if you are running {kib} locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`. 

If the Elastic {security-features} are enabled, log in. 
--

. In the side navigation, click *Stack Monitoring*. 
+
--
If data collection is disabled, you are prompted to turn on data collection. 
If {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have `manage` cluster 
privileges to turn on data collection. 

NOTE: If you are using a separate monitoring cluster, you do not need to turn on 
data collection. The dashboards appear when there is data in the monitoring 
cluster.  

--

You'll see cluster alerts
that require your attention and a summary of the available monitoring metrics
for {es}, Logstash, {kib}, and Beats. To view additional information, click the
Overview, Nodes, Indices, or Instances links.  See <<xpack-monitoring>>.
