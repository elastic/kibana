[[kibana-alerts]]
= {kib} alerts

The {stack} {monitor-features} provide
<<alerting-getting-started,{kib} alerting rules>> out-of-the box to notify you
of potential issues in the {stack}. These rules are preconfigured based on the
best practices recommended by Elastic. However, you can tailor them to meet your 
specific needs.

When you open *{stack-monitor-app}*, the preconfigured rules are created 
automatically. If you collect monitoring data from multiple clusters, these 
rules can search, detect, and notify on various conditions across the
clusters. The resulting alerts are visible alongside your existing {watcher} 
cluster alerts. You can view details about the alerts that are active and view 
health and performance data for {es}, {ls}, and Beats in real time, as well as
analyze past performance. You can also modify active alerts when you enter setup
mode.

<<alert-management,*Rules and Connectors*>> in *{stack-manage-app}*.

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-cpu-threshold]]
== CPU threshold

This rule checks for nodes that run a consistently high CPU load. By default, 
the condition is set at 85% or more averaged over the last 5 minutes. The rule 
is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 1 day.

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-disk-usage-threshold]]
== Disk usage threshold

This rule checks for nodes that are nearly at disk capacity. By default, the 
condition is set at 80% or more averaged over the last 5 minutes. The rule is 
grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running checks on a schedule time 
of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 1 day.

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-jvm-memory-threshold]]
== JVM memory threshold

This rule checks for nodes that run a consistently high JVM memory usage. By
default, the condition is set at 85% or more averaged over the last 5 minutes.
The rule is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running checks on a
schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 1 day. 

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-missing-monitoring-data]]
== Missing monitoring data

This rule checks for {stack} product nodes or instances that stop sending
monitoring data. By default, the condition is set to missing for 15 minutes
looking back 1 day. The rule is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by 
running checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 6 
hours. 

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-thread-pool-rejections]]
== Thread pool rejections (search/write)

This rule checks for nodes that experience thread pool rejections. By default,
the condition is set at 300 or more over the last 5 minutes. The rule is grouped
across all the nodes of the cluster by running checks on a schedule time of 1
minute with a re-notify interval of 1 day. Thresholds can be set independently 
for `search` and `write` type rejections.

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-ccr-read-exceptions]]
== CCR read exceptions

This rule checks for read exceptions on any of the replicated clusters. The
condition is met if 1 or more read exceptions are detected in the last hour. The
rule is grouped across all replicated clusters by running checks on a schedule 
time of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 6 hours. 

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-large-shard-size]]
== Large shard size

This rule checks for a large average shard size (across associated primaries) on
any of the specified index patterns. The condition is met if an index's average 
shard size is 55gb or higher in the last 5 minutes. The rule is grouped across 
all indices that match the default pattern of `*` by running checks on a
schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 12 hours.

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-cluster-alerts]]
== Cluster alerts

These rules check the current status of your {stack}. You can drill down into
the metrics to view more information about your cluster and specific nodes, instances, and indices.

An alert occurs if any of the following conditions are met within the last minute:

* {es} cluster health status is yellow (missing at least one replica)
or red (missing at least one primary).
* {es} version mismatch. You have {es} nodes with
different versions in the same cluster.
* {kib} version mismatch. You have {kib} instances with different
versions running against the same {es} cluster.
* Logstash version mismatch. You have Logstash nodes with different
versions reporting stats to the same monitoring cluster.
* {es} nodes changed. You have {es} nodes that were recently added or removed.
* {es} license expiration. The cluster's license is about to expire.
+
--
If you do not preserve the data directory when upgrading a {kib} or
Logstash node, the instance is assigned a new persistent UUID and shows up
as a new instance.
--
* Subscription license expiration. When the expiration date
approaches, you will get notifications with a severity level relative to how
soon the expiration date is:
  ** 60 days: Informational alert
  ** 30 days: Low-level alert
  ** 15 days: Medium-level alert
  ** 7 days: Severe-level alert
+
The 60-day and 30-day thresholds are skipped for Trial licenses, which are only
valid for 30 days.

NOTE: Some action types are subscription features, while others are free.

the {subscriptions}[Subscriptions page].
