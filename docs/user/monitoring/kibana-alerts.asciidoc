[[kibana-alerts]]
= {kib} Alerts

The {stack} {monitor-features} provide
<<alerting-getting-started,{kib} alerts>> out-of-the box to notify you of
potential issues in the {stack}. These alerts are preconfigured based on the
best practices recommended by Elastic. However, you can tailor them to meet your 
specific needs.

When you open *{stack-monitor-app}*, the preconfigured {kib} alerts are
created automatically. If you collect monitoring data from multiple clusters,
these alerts can search, detect, and notify on various conditions across the
clusters. The alerts are visible alongside your existing {watcher} cluster
alerts. You can view details about the alerts that are active and view health
and performance data for {es}, {ls}, and Beats in real time, as well as
analyze past performance. You can also modify active alerts.

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-cpu-threshold]]
== CPU threshold

This alert is triggered when a node runs a consistently high CPU load. By
default, the trigger condition is set at 85% or more averaged over the last 5
minutes. The alert is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running
checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify internal of 1 day. 

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-disk-usage-threshold]]
== Disk usage threshold

This alert is triggered when a node is nearly at disk capacity. By
default, the trigger condition is set at 80% or more averaged over the last 5
minutes. The alert is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running
checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify internal of 1 day. 

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-jvm-memory-threshold]]
== JVM memory threshold

This alert is triggered when a node runs a consistently high JVM memory usage. By
default, the trigger condition is set at 85% or more averaged over the last 5
minutes. The alert is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running
checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify internal of 1 day. 

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-missing-monitoring-data]]
== Missing monitoring data

This alert is triggered when any stack products nodes or instances stop sending
monitoring data. By default, the trigger condition is set to missing for 15 minutes
looking back 1 day. The alert is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running
checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify internal of 6 hours. 

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-thread-pool-rejections]]
== Thread pool rejections (search/write)

This alert is triggered when a node is experience thread pool rejections. By
default, the trigger condition is set at 300 or more over the last 5
minutes. The alert is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running
checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify internal of 1 day. 
Thresholds can be set independently for `search` and `write` type rejections.

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-ccr-read-exceptions]]
== CCR read exceptions

This alert is triggered if a read exception has been detected on any of the 
replicated clusters. The trigger condition is met if 1 or more read exceptions 
are detected in the last hour. The alert is grouped across all replicated clusters 
by running checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify internal of 6 hours. 

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-large-shard-size]]
== Large shard size

This alert is triggered if a large (primary) shard size is found on any of the 
specified index patterns. The trigger condition is met if an index's shard size is 
55gb or over in the last 5 minutes. The alert is grouped across all indices that match 
the default patter of `*` by running checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify 
internal of 12 hours.

[discrete]
[[kibana-alerts-cluster-alerts]]
== Cluster alerts

These alerts summarize the current status of your {stack}. You can drill down into the metrics 
to view more information about your cluster and specific nodes, instances, and indices.

An alert will be triggered if any of the following conditions are met within the last minute:

* {es} Cluster Health Status is Yellow (missing at least one replica)
or Red (missing at least one primary).
* {es} Version Mismatch. You have {es} nodes with
different versions in the same cluster.
* {kib} Version Mismatch. You have {kib} instances with different
versions running against the same {es} cluster.
* Logstash Version Mismatch. You have Logstash nodes with different
versions reporting stats to the same monitoring cluster.
* {es} Nodes Changed. You have {es} nodes that were recently added or removed.
* {es} License Expiration. The cluster's license is about to expire.
+
--
If you do not preserve the data directory when upgrading a {kib} or
Logstash node, the instance is assigned a new persistent UUID and shows up
as a new instance
--
* {xpack} License Expiration. When the {xpack} license expiration date
approaches, you will get notifications with a severity level relative to how
soon the expiration date is:
  ** 60 days: Informational alert
  ** 30 days: Low-level alert
  ** 15 days: Medium-level alert
  ** 7 days: Severe-level alert
+
The 60-day and 30-day thresholds are skipped for Trial licenses, which are only
valid for 30 days.
