= {kib} Alerts

The {stack} {monitor-features} provide
<<alerting-getting-started,{kib} alerts>> out-of-the box to notify you of
potential issues in the {stack}. These alerts are preconfigured based on the
best practices recommended by Elastic. However, you can tailor them to meet your 
specific needs.

When you open *{stack-monitor-app}*, the preconfigured {kib} alerts are
created automatically. If you collect monitoring data from multiple clusters,
these alerts can search, detect, and notify on various conditions across the
clusters. The alerts are visible alongside your existing {watcher} cluster
alerts. You can view details about the alerts that are active and view health
and performance data for {es}, {ls}, and Beats in real time, as well as
analyze past performance. You can also modify active alerts.

[[kibana-alerts-cpu-threshold]]
== CPU threshold

This alert is triggered when a node runs a consistently high CPU load. By
default, the trigger condition is set at 85% or more averaged over the last 5
minutes. The alert is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running
checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify internal of 1 day. 

NOTE: Some action types are subscription features, while others are free.
For a comparison of the Elastic subscription levels, see the alerting section of
the {subscriptions}[Subscriptions page].
