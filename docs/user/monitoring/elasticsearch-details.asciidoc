You can drill down into the status of your {es} cluster in {kib} by clicking
the <<cluster-overview-page, Overview>>, <<nodes-page, Nodes>>, and
<<indices-overview-page, Indices>> links on the *Monitoring* page.

See also {ref}/es-monitoring.html[Monitoring {es}].

[[cluster-overview-page]]
==== Cluster Overview

To view the key metrics that indicate the overall health of an {es} cluster,
click **Overview** in the {es} section. Anything that needs your attention is
highlighted in yellow or red.

TIP: Conditions that require your attention are listed at the top of the
Clusters page. You can also set up watches to alert you when the status
of your cluster changes. To learn how, see
{ref}/watch-cluster-status.html[Watch your cluster health].

The panel at the top shows the current cluster statistics, the charts show the
search and indexing performance over time, and the table at the bottom shows
information about any shards that are being recovered.

TIP: Not sure what a chart is showing? Click the info button for a description
of the metrics.

From there, you can dive into detailed metrics for particular nodes and indices.

==== Nodes

To view node metrics, click **Nodes**. The Nodes section shows the status
of each node in your cluster.

[float]
[[nodes-page-overview]]
===== Node Overview

Click the name of a node to view its node statistics over time. These represent
high-level statistics collected from {es} that provide a good overview of health.

[float]
[[nodes-page-advanced]]
===== Node Advanced

To view advanced node metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for a node. The
*Advanced* tab shows additional metrics, such as memory and garbage collection
statistics reported by the selected {es} node.

image::user/monitoring/images/monitoring-node-advanced.png["Elasticsearch Node Advanced",link="images/monitoring-node-advanced.png"]

You can use the advanced node view to diagnose issues that generally involve
more advanced knowledge of {es}, such as poor garbage collection performance.


[float]
[[indices-overview-page]]
==== Indices

To view index metrics, click **Indices**. The Indices section shows the same
overall index and search metrics as the Overview and a table of your indices.

image::user/monitoring/images/monitoring-indices.png["Elasticsearch Indices",link="images/monitoring-indices.png"]

[float]
[[indices-page-overview]]
===== Index Overview

From the Indices listing, you can view data for a particular index. To drill
down into the data for a particular index, click its name in the Indices table.

image::user/monitoring/images/monitoring-index.png["Elasticsearch Index Overview",link="images/monitoring-index.png"]

[float]
[[indices-page-advanced]]
===== Index Advanced

To view advanced index metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for an index. The
*Advanced*  tab shows additional metrics, such as memory statistics reported
about the {es} index. If the index has more than one shard, then its shards
might live on more than one node.

image::user/monitoring/images/monitoring-index-advanced.png["Elasticsearch Index Advanced",link="images/monitoring-index-advanced.png"]

The Advanced index view can be used to diagnose issues that generally involve
more advanced knowledge of {es}, such as wasteful index memory usage.

[float]
[[jobs-page]]
==== Jobs

To view {ml} job metrics, click **Jobs**. For each job in your cluster, it shows
information such as its status, the number of records processed, the size of the
model, the number of forecasts, and the node that runs the job.

image::user/monitoring/images/monitoring-jobs.png["Machine learning jobs",link="images/monitoring-jobs.png"]

[float]
[[ccr-overview-page]]
==== CCR

To view {ccr} metrics, click **CCR**. For each follower index on the cluster, it 
shows information such as the leader index, an indication of how much the
follower index is lagging behind the leader index, the last fetch time, the
number of operations synced, and error messages. If you select a follower index,
you can view the same information for each shard. For example:

image::user/monitoring/images/monitoring-ccr.png["Cross-cluster replication",link="images/monitoring-ccr.png"]

If you select a shard, you can see graphs for the fetch and operation delays. 
You can also see advanced information, which contains the results from the 
{ref}/ccr-get-follow-stats.html[get follower stats API]. For example:
 
image::user/monitoring/images/monitoring-ccr-shard.png["Cross-cluster replication shard details",link="images/monitoring-ccr-shard.png"]

For more information, see {ref}/xpack-ccr.html[Cross-cluster replication].
