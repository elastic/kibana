You can drill down into the status of your {es} cluster in {kib} by clicking
the <<cluster-overview-page, Overview>>, <<nodes-page, Nodes>>, 
<<indices-overview-page, Indices>> and <<logs-monitor-page,Logs>> links on the
*Stack Monitoring* page.

[[cluster-overview-page]]
== Cluster Overview

To view the key metrics that indicate the overall health of an {es} cluster,
click **Overview** in the {es} section. Anything that needs your attention is
highlighted in yellow or red.

TIP: Conditions that require your attention are listed at the top of the
Clusters page. You can also set up watches to alert you when the status
of your cluster changes. To learn how, see
{ref}/watch-cluster-status.html[Watching the status of an {es} cluster].

The panel at the top shows the current cluster statistics, the charts show the
search and indexing performance over time, and the table at the bottom shows
information about any shards that are being recovered. If you use {filebeat} to
collect log data from this cluster, you can also see its recent logs.

TIP: Not sure what a chart is showing? Click the info button for a description
of the metrics.

From there, you can dive into detailed metrics for particular nodes and indices.

[[nodes-page]]
== Nodes

To view node metrics, click **Nodes**. The Nodes section shows the status
of each node in your cluster.

[float]
[[nodes-page-overview]]
=== Node Overview

Click the name of a node to view its node statistics over time. These represent
high-level statistics collected from {es} that provide a good overview of
health. If you use {filebeat} to collect log data from this node, you can also
see its recent logs.

[float]
[[nodes-page-advanced]]
=== Node Advanced

To view advanced node metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for a node. The
*Advanced* tab shows additional metrics, such as memory and garbage collection
statistics reported by the selected {es} node.

You can use the advanced node view to diagnose issues that generally involve
more advanced knowledge of {es}, such as poor garbage collection performance.

[float]
[[indices-overview-page]]
== Indices

To view index metrics, click **Indices**. The Indices section shows the same
overall index and search metrics as the Overview and a table of your indices.

[float]
[[indices-page-overview]]
=== Index Overview

From the Indices listing, you can view data for a particular index. To drill
down into the data for a particular index, click its name in the Indices table.

[float]
[[indices-page-advanced]]
=== Index Advanced

To view advanced index metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for an index. The
*Advanced*  tab shows additional metrics, such as memory statistics reported
about the {es} index. If the index has more than one shard, then its shards
might live on more than one node.

The Advanced index view can be used to diagnose issues that generally involve
more advanced knowledge of {es}, such as wasteful index memory usage.

[float]
[[jobs-page]]
== Jobs

To view {ml} job metrics, click **Jobs**. For each job in your cluster, it shows
information such as its status, the number of records processed, the size of the
model, the number of forecasts, and the node that runs the job.

[float]
[[ccr-overview-page]]
== CCR

To view {ccr} metrics, click **CCR**. For each follower index on the cluster, it 
shows the following information:

- **Index**: The name of the follower index.
- **Follows**: The name of the leader index.
- **Alerts**: Any read exceptions that have been triggered for the index or its 
shards.
- **Sync Lag (ops)**: How many operations the follower index is lagging behind the 
leader index. 
+
This is calculated by finding the difference between the minimum and maximum operation 
sequence number on the leader (`leader_max_seq_no`) and the difference between the minimum 
and maximum global sequence number checkpoint on the follower (`follower_global_checkpoint`) 
for each shard over the selected time period. The difference in `follower_global_checkpoint` 
is subtracted from the difference in `leader_max_seq_no` for each shard, and the highest result 
across all shards is displayed.
- **Last fetch time**: The time elapsed since the last successful fetch from the leader index. 
Represents the longest time elapsed across all of the shards in the follower index.
- **Ops synced**: The number of operations indexed (replicated) into the follower index from 
the leader index in the selected time period. 
+
This metric is a sum of the number of operations indexed across all shards over the selected 
time period.
- **Error**: Any exceptions returned for the most recent document in the selected time period.

If you select a follower index, you can view the same information for each shard. 
For more information on the properties used to calculate these metrics, refer to the 
{ref}/ccr-get-follow-stats.html[get follower stats API] documentation.

If you select a shard, you can see graphs for the fetch and operation delays. 
You can also see advanced information, which contains additional stats from the 
{ref}/ccr-get-follow-stats.html[get follower stats API].

Learn more about {ref}/xpack-ccr.html[{ccr-cap}].

[float]
[[logs-monitor-page]]
== Logs

If you use {filebeat} to collect log data from your cluster, you can see its
recent logs in the *Stack Monitoring* application. The *Clusters* page lists the
number of informational, debug, and warning messages in the server and
deprecation logs. 

If you click *Logs*, you can see the most recent logs for the cluster.

TIP: By default, up to 10 log entries are shown. You can show up to 50 log
entries by changing the
<<monitoring-ui-settings,`monitoring.ui.elasticsearch.logFetchCount` setting>>.
If you changed the default name of filebeat indices, you also need to update
`monitoring.ui.logs.index` accordingly.
