Dashboards are the best way to visualize and share insights from your {es} data. 

// add link to reference of panel types
A dashboard is made of one or more panels that you can organize as you like. Each panel can display various types of content: visualizations such as charts, tables, metrics, and maps, static annotations like text or images, or even specialized views for Machine Learning or Observability data.

// add link to create section or list of editors
There are several editors in {kib} that let you create and configure different types of visualizations.

// add link to sharing section
At any time, you can share a dashboard you've created with your team, in {kib} or outside.

Some dashboards are created and managed by the system, and are identified as `managed` in your list of of dashboards. This generally happens when you set up an integration to add data. You can't edit managed dashboards directly, but you can duplicate them and edit these duplicates.
