=== Add filter controls

*Controls* are interactive panels you add to your dashboards to filter and display only the data you want to explore.

There are three types of controls:

* *Options list* &mdash; Adds a dropdown that allows you to filter the data with one or more options that you select.
+
For example, if you are using the *[Logs] Web Traffic* dashboard from the sample web logs data, you can add an options list for the `machine.os.keyword` field that allows you to display only the logs generated from `osx` and `ios` operating systems.

* *Range slider* &mdash; Adds a slider that allows you to filter the data within a specified range of values. 
+
For example, if you are using the *[Logs] Web Traffic* dashboard from the sample web logs data, you can add a range slider for the `hour_of_day` field that allows you to display only the log data from 9:00AM to 5:00PM.

* *Time slider* &mdash; Adds a time range slider that allows you to filter the data within a specified range of time, advance the time range backward and forward, and animate your change in data over the specified time range.
+
For example, you are using the *[Logs] Web Traffic* dashboard from the sample web logs data, and the global time filter is *Last 7 days*. When you add the time slider, you can click the previous and next buttons to advance the time range backward or forward, and click the play button to watch how the data changes over the last 7 days.
