To provide context to your dashboard panels, add *Text* panels that display important information, instructions, images, and more. You create *Text* panels using GitHub-flavored Markdown text.

. In the *Markdown* field, enter the text, then click *Update*.

For example, when you enter:

The following instructions are displayed:

Or when you enter:

[role="screenshot"]

The following image is displayed:

[WARNING]
============================================================================
When you export a dashboard, the uploaded image files are not exported. 
When importing a dashboard with an image panel, and the image file is unavailable, the image panel displays a `not found` warning. Such panels have to be fixed manually by re-uploading the image using the panel's image editor.
