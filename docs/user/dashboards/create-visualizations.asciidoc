[[manage-panels]]
== Manage panels
When creating a panel, you can choose to add it to a dashboard, or to save it to the Visualize Library so it can be added to multiple dashboards later.

There are also some common options that you can configure on the various types of panels to make a dashboard easier to navigate and analyze.

[float]
[[save-the-markdown-panel]]
=== Save to the Visualize Library

Save the panel to the *Visualize Library* and add it to the dashboard, or add it to the dashboard without saving.

To save the panel to the *Visualize Library*:

. Click *Save to library*.

. Enter the *Title* and add any applicable <<managing-tags,*Tags*>>.

. Make sure that *Add to Dashboard after saving* is selected.

. Click *Save and return*.

[float]
=== Save and add to dashboard
If you are editing the panel just for a specific dashboard, you can save the panel to the dashboard:

. Click *Save and return*.

. Add an optional title to the panel.

.. In the panel header, click *No Title*.

.. On the *Panel settings* window, select *Show title*.

.. Enter the *Title*, then click *Save*.

[[explore-the-underlying-documents]]
=== Link to Discover

You can add interactions to panels that allow you to open and explore the data in *Discover*. To use the interactions, the panel must use only one data view. 

There are three types of *Discover* interactions you can add to dashboard panels:

* *Panel interactions* &mdash; Opens panel data in *Discover*, including the dashboard-level filters, but not the panel-level filters.
+
To enable panel interactions, configure <<settings-explore-data-in-context,`xpack.discoverEnhanced.actions.exploreDataInContextMenu.enabled`>> in kibana.yml. If you are using 7.13.0 and earlier, panel interactions are enabled by default.
+
To use panel interactions, open the panel menu, then click *Explore underlying data*.

* *Series data interactions* &mdash; Opens the series data in *Discover*.
+
To enable series data interactions, configure <<settings-explore-data-in-chart,`xpack.discoverEnhanced.actions.exploreDataInChart.enabled`>> in kibana.yml. If you are using 7.13.0 and earlier, data series interactions are enabled by default.
+
To use series data interactions, click a data series in the panel.

* *Saved search interactions* &mdash; Opens <<save-your-search,saved search>> data in *Discover*.
+
To use saved search interactions, open the panel menu, then click *More > View saved search*.

[[add-text]]
== Text panels

To provide context to your dashboard panels, add *Text* panels that display important information, instructions, images, and more. You create *Text* panels using GitHub-flavored Markdown text.

. On the dashboard, click image:images/dashboard_createNewTextButton_7.15.0.png[Create New Text button in dashboard toolbar].

. In the *Markdown* field, enter the text, then click *Update*.

For example, when you enter:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/markdown_example_1.png[Markdown text with links]

The following instructions are displayed:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/markdown_example_2.png[Panel with markdown link text]

Or when you enter:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/markdown_example_3.png[Markdown text with image file]

The following image is displayed:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/markdown_example_4.png[Panel with markdown image]

For detailed information about writing on GitHub, click *Help*.



[[add-image]]
== Image panels

To personalize your dashboards, add your own logos and graphics with the *Image* panel. You can upload images from your computer, select previously uploaded images, or add images from an external link.

. On the dashboard, click image:images/dashboard_createNewImageButton_8.7.0.png[Create New Image button in dashboard toolbar].
. Use the editor to add an image.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/dashboard_addImageEditor_8.7.0.png[Add image editor]

To manage your uploaded image files, open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Kibana > Files*. 


[WARNING]
============================================================================
When you export a dashboard, the uploaded image files are not exported. 
When importing a dashboard with an image panel, and the image file is unavailable, the image panel displays a `not found` warning. Such panels have to be fixed manually by re-uploading the image using the panel's image editor.
