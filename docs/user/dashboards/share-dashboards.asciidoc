== Share dashboards

To share the dashboard with a larger audience, click *Share* in the toolbar. For detailed information about the sharing options, refer to <<reporting-getting-started,Reporting>>.

TIP: When sharing a dashboard with a link while a panel is in maximized view, the generated link will also open the dashboard on the same maximized panel view.

== Export dashboards

To automate {kib}, you can export dashboards as NDJSON using the <<saved-objects-api-export, Export objects API>>. It is important to export dashboards with all necessary references.
