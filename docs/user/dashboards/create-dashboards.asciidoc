[[dashboard-minimum-requirements]]

To create or edit dashboards, you first need to:

* have {ref}/getting-started-index.html[data indexed into {es}] and a <<data-views, data view>>. A data view is a subset of your {es} data, and allows you to load just the right data when building a visualization or exploring it. 
+
TIP: If you don't have data at hand and still want to explore dashboards, you can import one of the <<sample-data,sample data sets>> available.

* have sufficient permissions on the **Dashboard** feature. If that's not the case, you might get a read-only indicator. A {kib} administrator can <<kibana-privileges,grant you the required privileges>>.
