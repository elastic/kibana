== Creating {dataframe-transforms}

beta[]

You can create {stack-ov}/ml-dataframes.html[{dataframe-transforms}] in the 
{kib} Machine Learning application.

Select the index pattern or saved search you want to transform. To pivot your 
data, you must group the data by at least one field and apply at least one 
aggregation. The {dataframe} pivot preview on the right side provides a visual 
verification.

Once you have created the pivot, add a job ID and define the index for the 
transformed data (_target index_). If the target index does not exist, it will be 
created automatically. You can optionally select to create a {kib} index pattern 
for the target index. At the end of the process, a {dataframe} job is created as 
a result.

After you create {dataframe} jobs, you can start, stop, and delete them 
and explore their progress and statistics from the jobs list.

For a more detailed example of using {dataframes} with the {kib} sample data,
see {stack-ov}/ecommerce-dataframes.html[Transforming your data].

[NOTE]
===============================
If {stack} {security-features} are enabled, you must have appropriate authority
to work with {dataframes}. For example, there are built-in
`data_frame_transforms_admin` and `data_frame_transforms_user` roles that have
`manage_data_frame_transforms` and `monitor_data_frame_transforms` cluster
privileges respectively. See
{stack-ov}/built-in-roles.html[Built-in roles] and
{stack-ov}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges].

Depending on what tasks you perform, you might require additional privileges.
For example, to create a {dataframe-transform} and generate a new target index,
you need `manage_data_frame_transforms` cluster privileges, `read` and
`view_index_metadata` privileges on the source index, and `read`, `create_index`,
and `index` privileges on the target index. For more information, see the
authorization details for each {ref}/data-frame-apis.html[{dataframe} API].
