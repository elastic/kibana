As datasets increase in size and complexity, the human effort required to
inspect dashboards or maintain rules for spotting infrastructure problems,
cyber attacks, or business issues becomes impractical. Elastic {ml-features}
such as {anomaly-detect} make it easier to notice suspicious activities with
minimal human interference.

If you have a basic license, you can use the *Data Visualizer* to learn more
about your data. In particular, if your data is stored in {es} and contains a
time field, you can use the *Data Visualizer* to identify possible fields for
{anomaly-detect}:

experimental[] You can also upload a CSV, NDJSON, or log file (up to 100 MB in size). 
The *Data Visualizer* identifies the file format and field mappings. You can then 
optionally import that data into an {es} index.

The Elastic {ml} {anomaly-detect} feature automatically model the normal
behavior of your time series data — learning trends, periodicity, and more — in
real time to identify anomalies, streamline root cause analysis, and reduce
false positives.

{anomaly-detect-cap} run in and scale with {es}, and include an
intuitive UI on the {kib} *Machine Learning* page for creating {anomaly-jobs} 
and understanding results.

If you have a license that includes the {ml} features, you can create
{anomaly-jobs} and manage jobs and {dfeeds} from the *Job Management* pane:

You can use the *Settings* pane to create and edit 
{ml-docs}/ml-calendars.html[calendars] and the filters that are used in 
{ml-docs}/ml-rules.html[custom rules]:

The *Anomaly Explorer* and *Single Metric Viewer* display the results of your
{anomaly-jobs}. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/ml/images/ml-single-metric-viewer.jpg[Single Metric Viewer]

You can optionally add annotations by drag-selecting a period of time in
the *Single Metric Viewer* and adding a description. For example, you can add an
explanation for anomalies in that time period or provide notes about what is
occurring in your operational environment at that time:

In some circumstances, annotations are also added automatically. For example, if
the {anomaly-job} detects that there is missing data, it annotates the affected
time period. For more information, see <<ml-delayed-data-detection>>.
The *Job Management* pane shows the full list of annotations for each job.

NOTE: The {kib} {ml-features} use pop-ups. You must configure your
web browser so that it does not block pop-up windows or create an exception for
your {kib} URL.
