Ready to get some hands-on experience with {kib}? There are two ways to start:

* <<tutorial-sample-data, Explore {kib} using the Flights dashboard>>
+
Load the Flights sample data and dashboard with one click and start 
interacting with {kib} visualizations in seconds.

* <<tutorial-build-dashboard, Build your own dashboard>> 
+
Manually load a data set and build your own visualizations and dashboard.

Before you begin, make sure you've <<install, installed Kibana>> and established
a {kibana-ref}/connect-to-elasticsearch.html[connection to Elasticsearch].
You might also be interested in the
https://www.elastic.co/webinars/getting-started-kibana[Getting Started with Kibana]
video tutorial.

If you are running our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, you access Kibana with a single click. (You can {ess-trial}[sign up for a free trial] and start exploring data in minutes.)
