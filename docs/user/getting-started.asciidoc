Ready to try out {kib} and see what it can do? The quickest way to get started with {kib} is to set up on Cloud, then add a sample data set to explore the full range of {kib} features.

== Get data into {kib}

The easiest way to get data into {kib} is to add a sample data set.

{kib} has several sample data sets that you can use before loading your own data:

* *Sample eCommerce orders* includes visualizations for tracking product-related information,
such as cost, revenue, and price.

* *Sample flight data* includes visualizations for monitoring flight routes.

* *Sample web logs* includes visualizations for monitoring website traffic.

To use the sample data sets:

. Go to the home page.

. Click *Load a data set and a {kib} dashboard*.

. Click *View data* and view the prepackaged dashboards, maps, and more.

NOTE: The timestamps in the sample data sets are relative to when they are installed.
If you uninstall and reinstall a data set, the timestamps change to reflect the most recent installation.
