== Set up on Cloud

To access {kib} in a single click, run our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud.

. Log into the link:https://cloud.elastic.co/[Elasticsearch Service Console].
If you need an account, register for a link:https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup[free 14-day trial].

. Click *Create deployment*, then give your deployment a name.

. To use the default options, click *Create deployment*. You can modify the other deployment options, but the default options are great to get started.

== Get data into {kib}

The easiest way to get data into {kib} is to add a sample data set.

{kib} has several sample data sets that you can use before loading your own data:

* *Sample eCommerce orders* includes visualizations for tracking product-related information,
such as cost, revenue, and price.

* *Sample flight data* includes visualizations for monitoring flight routes.

* *Sample web logs* includes visualizations for monitoring website traffic.

To use the sample data sets:

. Go to the {kib} home page.

. Click *Load a data set and a {kib} dashboard*.

. Click *View data* and view the prepackaged dashboards, maps, and more.

NOTE: The timestamps in the sample data sets are relative to when they are installed.
If you uninstall and reinstall a data set, the timestamps change to reflect the most recent installation.
