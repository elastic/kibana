You’re new to Kibana and want to give it a try. {kib} has sample data sets and 
tutorials to help you get started.

[float]
=== Sample data

You can use the <<add-sample-data, sample data 
sets>> to take {kib} for a test ride without having 
to go through the process of loading data yourself. With one click, 
you can install a sample data set and start interacting with 
{kib} visualizations in seconds. You can access the sample data 
from the {kib} home page.

=== Add data tutorials
{kib} has built-in *Add Data* tutorials to help you set up
data flows in the Elastic Stack. These tutorials are available 
from the Kibana home page. In *Add Data to Kibana*, find the data type 
you’re interested in, and click its button to view a list of available tutorials. 

[float]
=== Hands-on experience 

The following tutorials walk you through searching, analyzing, 
and visualizing data.

* <<tutorial-sample-data, Explore Kibana using sample data>>. You'll
learn to filter and query data, edit visualizations, and interact with dashboards. 

* <<tutorial-build-dashboard, Build your own dashboard>>.  You'll manually load a data set and build 
your own visualizations and dashboard. 

[float]
=== Before you begin

Make sure you've <<install, installed Kibana>> and established
a <<connect-to-elasticsearch, connection to Elasticsearch>>.

If you are running our https://cloud.elastic.co[hosted Elasticsearch Service] 
on Elastic Cloud, you can access Kibana with a single click.
