*Canvas* is a data visualization and presentation tool that allows you to pull live data from {es}, 
then combine the data with colors, images, text, and your imagination to create dynamic, multi-page, pixel-perfect displays. 
If you are a little bit creative, a little bit technical, and a whole lot curious, then *Canvas* is for you.

With *Canvas*, you can:

* Create and personalize your work space with backgrounds, borders, colors, fonts, and more.

* Customize your workpad with your own visualizations, such as images and text.

* Pull your data directly from {es}, then show it off with charts, graphs, progress monitors, and more.

* Focus the data you want to display with filters.

=== Minimum requirements

To create workpads, you must meet the minimum requirements. 

* If you need to set up {kib}, use https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup?baymax=docs-body&elektra=docs[our free trial].

* Make sure you have {ref}/getting-started-index.html[data indexed into {es}] and a <<data-views, data view>>.

[float]
[[create-elements]]
=== Create elements

Choose the type of element you want to use, then use the preconfigured demo data to familiarize yourself with the element. When you're ready, connect the element to your own data. 
By default, most of the elements you create use the demo data until you change the data source. The demo data includes a small data set that you can use to experiment with your element.

. Click *Add element*, then select the element you want to use.

. To connect the element to your data, select *Data*, then select one of the following data sources:

* *{es} SQL* &mdash; Access your data in {es} using {ref}/sql-spec.html[SQL syntax].

* *{es} documents* &mdash; Access your data in {es} without using aggregations. To use, select an index and fields, and optionally enter a query using the <<lucene-query,Lucene Query Syntax>>. 
Use the *{es} documents* data source when you have low volume datasets, to view raw documents, or to plot exact, non-aggregated values on a chart.

* *Timelion* &mdash; Access your time series data using <<timelion,*Timelion*>> queries. To use *Timelion* queries, you can enter a query using the <<lucene-query,Lucene Query Syntax>>.
+
Each element can display a different data source, and pages and workpads often contain multiple data sources.

. To save, use the following options:

* To save a single element, select the element, then click *Edit > Save as new element*.

* To save a group of elements, press and hold Shift, select the elements you want to save, then click *Edit > Save as new element*.

To access your saved elements, click *Add element > My elements*.
