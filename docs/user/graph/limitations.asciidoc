=== Limited support for multiple indices
The graph API can explore multiple indices, types, or aliases in a
single API request, but the assumption is that each "hop" it performs
is querying the same set of indices. Currently, it is not possible to
take a term found in a field from one index and use that value to explore
connections in _a different field_ held in another type or index.

A good example of where this might be useful is if an IP address is
found in the `remote_host` field of an index called "weblogs20160101",
you might want to follow that up by looking for the same address in
the `ip_address` field of an index called "knownthreats".

Supporting this behaviour would require extra mappings to indicate that
the weblogs' `remote_host` field contained values that had currency and
meaning in the `ip_address` field of the threats index.

Since we do not currently support this translation, you would have to
perform multiple calls to take the values from the weblogs index
response and build them into a separate request to the threats index.
