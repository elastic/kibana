== Configure Graph

When a user saves a graph workspace in Kibana, it is stored in the `.kibana`
index along with other saved objects like visualizations and dashboards.
By default, both the configuration and data are saved for the workspace:

[horizontal]
*configuration*::
The selected data view, fields, colors, icons,
and settings.
*data*::
The visualized content (the vertices and connections displayed in
the workspace).

The data in a saved workspace is like a report--it is a saved snapshot that
potentially summarizes millions of raw documents. Once saved, these summaries
are no longer controlled by security policies. Because the original documents
might be deleted after a workspace is saved, there's no practical basis for
checking permissions for the data in a saved workspace.

For this reason, you can configure the save policy for graph workspaces to
ensure appropriate handling of your data. You can allow all users to save
only the configuration information for a graph, require all users to
explicitly include the workspace data, or completely disable the ability
to save a workspace.

For example, to disable the save option entirely, set
`xpack.graph.savePolicy` to `none` in `kibana.yml`:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.graph.savePolicy: none
--------------------------------------------------

The supported save policies are:

`none`::
Neither the configuration or data can be saved.
`config`::
Only the configuration is saved.
`configAndData`::
Both configuration and data are saved. This is the
default policy.
`configAndDataWithConsent`::
Only the configuration is saved unless the user
explicitly selects the include data option.

=== Use Security to grant access
You can also use security to grant read only or all access to different roles.
When security is used to grant read only access, the following  indicator in Kibana
is displayed. For more information on granting access to Kibana, see
<<xpack-security-authorization>>.

[[disable-drill-down]]
=== Disable drilldown configuration

By default, users can configure _drilldown_ URLs to display additional
information about a selected vertex in a new browser window. For example,
you could configure a drilldown URL to perform a web search for the selected
vertex term.

To prevent users from adding drilldown URLs,  set
`xpack.graph.canEditDrillDownUrls` to `false` in `kibana.yml`:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.graph.canEditDrillDownUrls: false
--------------------------------------------------
