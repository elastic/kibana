== Using Graph

Graph is automatically enabled in {es} and {kib}.

[[exploring-connections]]
To start exploring connections in your data:

. From the side navigation, open the graph explorer.

. Select an index pattern to specify what indices you want to explore.
+
For example, if you are indexing log data with Logstash, you could select the
`logstash-*` index pattern to visualize connections within the log entries.

. Select one or more multi-value fields that contain the terms you want to
graph. 
+
The vertices in the graph are selected from these terms. If you're
visualizing connections between Apache log entries, you could select the
`url.raw` field and the `geo.src` field so you can look at which pages are
being accessed from different locations.

. Enter a search query to discover relationships between terms in the selected
fields. 
+
For example, to generate a graph of the successful requests to
particular pages from different locations, you could search for the 200
response code. The weight of the connection between two vertices indicates how strongly they
are related.

. To view more information about the relationship, click any connection.

. Use the toolbar buttons to explore
additional connections:
+
* To display additional vertices that connect to your graph, click Expand

* To display additional
connections between the displayed vertices, click Link

* To explore a particular area of the
graph, select the vertices you are interested in, and click Expand or Link.
* To step back through your changes to the graph, click Undo
image:user/graph/images/graph-undo-button.jpg[Undo].

. To see more relationships in your data, submit additional queries.

NOTE: By default, when you submit a search query, Graph searches all available
fields. You can constrain your search to a particular field using the Lucene
query syntax. For example,  `machine.os: osx`.
