The {graph-features} enable you to discover how items in an
Elasticsearch index are related. You can explore the connections between
indexed terms and see which connections are the most meaningful. This can be
useful in a variety of applications, from fraud detection to recommendation
engines.

For example, graph exploration could help you uncover website vulnerabilities
that hackers are targeting so you can harden your website. Or, you might
provide graph-based personalized recommendations to your e-commerce customers.

The {graph-features} provide a simple, yet powerful {ref}/graph-explore-api.html[graph exploration API],
and an interactive graph visualization tool for Kibana. Both work out of the
box with existing Elasticsearch indices--you don't need to store any
additional data to use these features.

[[how-graph-works]]
== How Graph works
The graph API provides an alternative way to extract and summarize information
about the documents and terms in your Elasticsearch index. A _graph_ is really
just a network of related items. In our case, this means a network of related
terms in the index.

The terms you want to include in the graph are called _vertices_. The
relationship between any two vertices is a _connection_. The connection
summarizes the documents that contain both vertices' terms.

NOTE: If you're into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory[graph theory],
you might know vertices and connections as _nodes_ and _edges_. They're the
same thing, we just want to use terminology that makes sense to people who
aren't graph geeks and avoid any confusion with the nodes in an Elasticsearch
cluster.

The graph vertices are simply the terms that you've already indexed. The
connections are derived on the fly using Elasticsearch aggregations. To
identify the most _meaningful_ connections, the graph API leverages
Elasticsearch relevance scoring. The same data structures and relevance ranking
tools built into Elasticsearch to support text searches enable the graph API to
separate useful signals from the noise that is typical of most connected data.

This foundation lets you easily answer questions like:

* What are the shared behaviors of people trying to hack my website?
* If users bought this type of gardening glove, what other products might they
be interested in?
* Which people on Stack Overflow have expertise in both Hadoop-related
technologies and Python-related tech?

But what about performance? The Elasticsearch aggregation framework
enables the graph API to quickly summarize millions of documents as a single
super-connection. Instead of retrieving every banking transaction between
accounts A and B, it derives a single connection that represents that
relationship. And, of course, this summarization process works across
multi-node clusters and scales with your Elasticsearch deployment.
Advanced options let you control how your data is sampled and summarized.
You can also set timeouts to prevent graph queries from adversely
affecting the cluster.

[[graph-connection]]
== Graph a data connection

Graph your data to reveal patterns and relationships.

. Open the main menu, and then click *Graph*.
+
If you're new to Kibana, and don't have any data, follow the links to add sample data.
The instructions here use the {kib} sample web logs data set.

. Select the data source you want to explore.
+
{kib} graphs the relationships between the top fields.

. Add more fields, or click an existing field filter to disable or delete it.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::user/graph/images/graph-menu.png["menu for editing, disabling, or removing a field from the graph", width=75%]


. Enter a query to discover relationships between terms in the selected
fields.
+
For example,
to generate a graph of the successful requests to
particular pages from different locations, you could search for the 200
response code. The weight of the connection between two vertices indicates how strongly they
are related.

. To view more information about the relationship, click any connection or vertex.

. To explore additional connections, use the control bar :

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/graph/images/graph-control-bar.png["Graph control bar", width=75%]
+
* To display additional vertices that connect to your graph, click the expand icon
image:user/graph/images/graph-expand-button.png[Expand Selection].
* To display additional
connections between the displayed vertices, click the link icon
image:user/graph/images/graph-link-button.png[Add links to existing terms].
* To explore a particular area of the
graph, select the vertices you are interested in, and then click expand or link.
* To step back through your changes to the graph, click undo
image:user/graph/images/graph-undo-button.png[Undo] and redo
image:user/graph/images/graph-redo-button.png[Redo].

. To see more relationships in your data, submit additional queries.

. *Save* your graph.

[[style-vertex-properties]]
=== Style vertex properties

Each vertex has a color, icon, and label. To change
the color or icon of all vertices
of a certain field, click it's filter, and then
select *Edit settings*.

To change the color and label of selected vertices,
click the style icon image:user/graph/images/graph-style-button.png[Style]
in the control bar.


[float]
[[edit-graph-settings]]
=== Edit graph settings

By default, *Graph* is configured to tune out noise in your data.
If this isn't a good fit for your data, use *Settings > Advanced settings*
to adjust the way *Graph* queries your data. You can tune the graph to show
only the results relevant to you and to improve performance.
For more information, see <<graph-troubleshooting, Graph troubleshooting>>.

You can configure the number of vertices that a search or
expand operation adds to the graph.
By default, only the five most relevant terms for any given field are added
at a time. This keeps the graph from overflowing. To increase this number, click
a field, select *Edit Settings*, and change *Terms per hop*.

[float]
[[graph-block-terms]]
=== Block terms from the graph
Documents that match a blocked term are not allowed in the graph.
To block a term, select its vertex and click
the block icon
image:user/graph/images/graph-block-button.png[Block selection]
in the control panel.
For a list of blocked terms, go to *Settings > Blocked terms*.

[float]
[[graph-drill-down]]
=== Drill down into raw documents
With drilldowns, you can display additional information about a
selected vertex in a new browser window. For example, you might
configure a drilldown URL to perform a web search for the selected vertex term.

Use the drilldown icon image:user/graph/images/graph-info-icon.png[Drilldown selection]
in the control panel to show the drilldown buttons for the selected vertices.
To configure drilldowns, go to *Settings > Drilldowns*. See also
<<disable-drill-down, Disabling drilldown configuration>>.

[float]
[[graph-run-layout]]
=== Run and pause layout
Graph uses a "force layout", where vertices behave like magnets,
pushing off of one another. By default, when you add a new vertex to
the graph, all vertices begin moving. In some cases, the movement might
go on for some time. To freeze the current vertex position,
click the pause icon
image:user/graph/images/graph-pause-button.png[Block selection]
in the control panel.
