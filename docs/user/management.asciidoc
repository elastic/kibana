*Management* is home to UIs for managing all things Elastic Stack&mdash;
indices, clusters, licenses, UI settings, index patterns, spaces, and more.

[cols="50, 50"]
|===

a| <<working-remote-clusters, *Cross-Cluster Replication*>>

Replicate indices on a remote cluster and copy them to a follower index on a local cluster.
This is important for
disaster recovery. It also keeps data local for faster queries.

| <<index-lifecycle-policies, *Index Lifecycle Policies*>>

Create a policy for defining the lifecycle of an index as it ages
through the hot, warm, cold, and delete phases.
Such policies help you control operation costs
because you can put data in different resource tiers.

a| <<managing-indices, *Index Management*>>

View index settings, mappings, and statistics and perform operations, such as refreshing,
flushing, and clearing the cache. Practicing good index management ensures
that your data is stored cost effectively.

| <<managing-licenses, *License Management*>>

View the status of your license, start a trial, or install a new license. For
the full list of features that are included in your license,
see the https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription page].

| <<working-remote-clusters, *Remote Clusters*>>

Manage your remote clusters for use with cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication.
You can add and remove remote clusters, and check their connectivity.

| <<data-rollups, *Rollup Jobs*>>

Create a job that periodically aggregates data from one or more indices, and then
rolls it into a new, compact index. Rollup indices are a good way to store months or
years of historical data in combination with your raw data.

| <<snapshot-repositories, *Snapshot and Restore*>>

Define a policy that creates, schedules, and automatically deletes snapshots to ensure that you
have backups of your cluster in case something goes wrong.

| {ref}/transforms.html[*Transforms*]

Use transforms to pivot existing {es} indices into summarized or entity-centric indices.

| <<upgrade-assistant, *Upgrade Assistant*>>

Identify the issues that you need to address before upgrading to the
next major version of {es}, and then reindex, if needed.

| <<watcher-ui, *Watcher*>>

Detect changes in your data by creating, managing, and monitoring alerts.
For example, create an alert when the maximum total CPU usage on a machine goes
above a certain percentage.

[float]
[[manage-kibana]]
== Manage {kib}

[cols="50, 50"]
|===

a| <<advanced-options, *Advanced Settings*>>

Customize {kib} to suit your needs. Change the format for displaying dates, turn on dark mode,
set the timespan for notification messages, and much more.

| <<managing-fields, *Index Patterns*>>

Create and manage the index patterns that help you retrieve your data from {es}.

| <<reporting-getting-started, *Reporting*>>

Monitor the generation of reports&mdash;PDF, PNG, and CSV&mdash;and download reports that you previously generated.
A report can contain a dashboard, visualization, saved search, or Canvas workpad.

| <<managing-saved-objects, *Saved Objects*>>

Copy, edit, delete, import, and export your saved objects.
These include dashboards, visualizations, maps, index patterns, Canvas workpads, and more.

| <<xpack-spaces, *Spaces*>>

Create spaces to organize your dashboards and other saved objects into categories.
A space is isolated from all other spaces,
so you can tailor it to your needs without impacting others.
