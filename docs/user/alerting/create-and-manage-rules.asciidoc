== Create and manage rules

The *{stack-manage-app}* > *{rules-ui}* UI provides a cross-app view of alerting.
Different {kib} apps like {observability-guide}/create-alerts.html[*{observability}*],
{security-guide}/prebuilt-rules.html[*Security*], <<geo-alerting,*Maps*>> and
<<xpack-ml,*{ml-app}*>> can offer their own rules. *{rules-ui}* provides a
central place to:

* <<create-edit-rules,Create and edit>> rules
* <<controlling-rules,Manage rules>> including enabling/disabling, muting/unmuting, and deleting
* Drill down to <<rule-details,rule details>>

=== Required permissions

Access to rules is granted based on your privileges to {alert-features}. For
more information, go to <<alerting-security>>.

[[create-edit-rules]]
=== Create and edit rules

Many rules must be created within the context of a {kib} app like
<<metrics-app,Metrics>>, <<xpack-apm,APM>>, or <<uptime-app,Uptime>>, but others
are generic. Generic rule types can be created in *{rules-ui}* by clicking the
*Create rule* button. This will launch a flyout that guides you through selecting
a rule type and configuring its conditions and action type. For details on what
types of rules are available and how to configure them, refer to <<stack-rules>>.

After a rule is created, you can open the action menu (…) and select *Edit rule*
to re-open the flyout and change the rule properties.

==== General rule details

All rules share the following four properties:

Name:: The name of the rule. While this name does not have to be unique, a
distinctive name can help you identify a rule.
Tags:: A list of tag names that can be applied to a rule. Tags can help you
organize and find rules.
Check every:: Defines how often to evaluate the rule condition. Checks are
queued; they run as close to the defined value as capacity allows. For more
details, go to <<alerting-production-considerations,Alerting production considerations>>.
Notify:: Defines how often alerts generate actions. Options include running
actions at each check interval, only when the alert status changes, or at a
custom action interval.

[TIP]
==============================================
Since actions are triggered per alert, a rule can end up generating a large
number of actions. Take the following example where a rule is monitoring three
servers every minute for CPU usage > 0.9, and the rule is set to notify
`On check intervals`:

* Minute 1: server X123 > 0.9. _One email_ is sent for server X123.
* Minute 2: X123 and Y456 > 0.9. _Two emails_ are sent, one for X123 and one for Y456.
* Minute 3: X123, Y456, Z789 > 0.9. _Three emails_ are sent, one for each of X123, Y456, Z789.

In this example, three emails are sent for server X123 in the span of 3 minutes
for the same rule. Often, it's desirable to suppress these re-notifications. If
you set the rule notify setting to `On custom action intervals` with an interval
of 5 minutes, you reduce noise by getting emails only every 5 minutes for
servers that continue to exceed the threshold:

* Minute 1: server X123 > 0.9. _One email_ is sent for server X123.
* Minute 2: X123 and Y456 > 0.9. _One email_ is sent for Y456.
* Minute 3: X123, Y456, Z789 > 0.9. _One email_ is sent for Z789.

To get notified only once when a server exceeds the threshold, you can set the
rule notify setting to `On status changes`.

[[defining-rules-type-conditions]]
==== Rule type and conditions

Depending upon the {kib} app and context, you might be prompted to choose the type of rule to create. Some apps will preselect the type of rule for you.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-flyout-rule-type-selection.png[Choosing the type of rule to create]

Each rule type provides its own way of defining the conditions to detect, but an expression formed by a series of clauses is a common pattern. Each clause has a UI control that allows you to define the clause. For example, in an index threshold rule, the `WHEN` clause allows you to select an aggregation operation to apply to a numeric field.

[float]
[[defining-rules-actions-details]]
==== Action type and details

Actions are optional when you create a rule. However, to receive notifications when a rule meets the defined conditions, you must add one or more actions. Start by selecting a type of connector for your action:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-flyout-connector-type-selection.png[UI for selecting an action type]

Each action must specify a <<alerting-concepts-connectors, connector>> instance. If no connectors exist for the selected type, click **Add connector** to create one.

After you have selected a connector, use the **Run When** dropdown to choose the action group to associate with this action. When a rule meets the defined condition, it is marked as **Active** and alerts are created and assigned to an action group. In addition to the action groups defined by the selected rule type, each rule also has a **Recovered** action group that is assigned when a rule's conditions are no longer detected.

Each action type exposes different properties. For example, an email action allows you to set the recipients, the subject, and a message body in markdown format. See <<action-types>> for details on the types of actions provided by {kib} and their properties.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-flyout-action-details.png[UI for defining an email action]

You can attach more than one action. Clicking the *Add action* button will prompt you to select another rule type and repeat the above steps again.

[float]
[[defining-rules-actions-variables]]
===== Action variables
Using the https://mustache.github.io/[Mustache] template syntax `{{variable name}}`, you can pass rule values at the time a condition is detected to an action. You can access the list of available variables using the "add rule variable" button. Although available variables differ by rule type, all rule types pass the following variables:

`rule.id`:: The ID of the rule.
`rule.name`:: The name of the rule.
`rule.spaceId`:: The ID of the space for the rule.
`rule.tags`:: The list of tags applied to the rule.
`date`:: The date the rule scheduled the action, in ISO format.
`alert.id`:: The ID of the alert that scheduled the action.
`alert.uuid`:: The UUID of the alert that scheduled the action.  The UUID value will remain unchanged while the alert is active, during subsequent runs
`alert.actionGroup`:: The ID of the action group of the alert that scheduled the action.
`alert.actionSubgroup`:: The action subgroup of the alert that scheduled the action.
`alert.actionGroupName`:: The name of the action group of the alert that scheduled the action.
`alert.flapping`:: A flag on the alert that indicates whether the alert status is changing repeatedly.

`kibanaBaseUrl`:: The configured <<server-publicBaseUrl, `server.publicBaseUrl`>>. If not configured, this will be empty.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-flyout-action-variables.png[Passing rule values to an action]

Some cases exist where the variable values will be "escaped", when used in a context where escaping is needed:

- For the <<email-action-type, Email>> connector, the `message` action configuration property escapes any characters that would be interpreted as Markdown.
- For the <<slack-action-type, Slack>> connector, the `message` action configuration property escapes any characters that would be interpreted as Slack Markdown.
- For the <<webhook-action-type, Webhook>> connector, the `body` action configuration property escapes any characters that are invalid in JSON string values.

Mustache also supports "triple braces" of the form `{{{variable name}}}`, which indicates no escaping should be done at all.  Care should be used when using this form, as it could end up rendering the variable content in such a way as to make the resulting parameter invalid or formatted incorrectly.

[float]
[[defining-rules-actions-variable-context]]
===== Action variable context

Each rule type defines additional variables as properties of the variable `context`.  For example, if a rule type defines a variable `value`, it can be used in an action parameter as `{{context.value}}`.  

For diagnostic or exploratory purposes, action variables whose values are objects, such as `context`, can be referenced directly as variables. The resulting value will be a JSON representation of the object.  For example, if an action parameter includes `{{context}}`, it will expand to the JSON representation of all the variables and values provided by the rule type. To see alert-specific variables, use `{{.}} `.

For situations where your rule response returns arrays of data, you can loop through the `context` by

[source]
--------------------------------------------------
{{#context}}{{.}}{{/context}}
--------------------------------------------------

For example, looping through search result hits may appear

[source]
--------------------------------------------------
triggering data was:
{{#context.hits}} - {{_source.message}}
{{/context.hits}}
--------------------------------------------------

[[controlling-rules]]
=== Snooze and disable rules

The rule listing enables you to quickly snooze, disable, enable, or delete
individual rules. For example, you can change the state of a rule:

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/individual-enable-disable.png[Use the rule status dropdown to enable or disable an individual rule]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

When you snooze a rule, the rule checks continue to run on a schedule but the
alert will not trigger any actions. You can snooze for a specified period of
time, indefinitely, or schedule single or recurring downtimes:

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/snooze-panel.png[Snooze notifications for a rule]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

When a rule is in a `snoozed` state, you can cancel or change the duration of
this state.

[float]
=== Rule status

A rule can have one of the following statuses:

`failed`:: The rule ran with errors.
`succeeded`:: The rule ran without errors.
`warning`:: The rule ran with some non-critical errors.

[float]
[[importing-and-exporting-rules]]
=== Import and export rules

To import and export rules, use <<managing-saved-objects,Saved Objects>>.

[NOTE]
==============================================
Some rule types cannot be exported through this interface:

**Security rules** can be imported and exported using the {security-guide}/rules-ui-management.html#import-export-rules-ui[Security UI].

**Stack monitoring rules** are <<kibana-alerts, automatically created>> for you and therefore cannot be managed in *Saved Objects*.
==============================================

Rules are disabled on export. You are prompted to re-enable the rule on successful import.

[float]
[[rule-details]]
=== Drill down to rule details

Select a rule name from the rule listing to access the *Rule details* page, which tells you about the state of the rule and provides granular control over the actions it is taking. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-details-alerts-active.png[Rule details page with three alerts]

In this example, the rule detects when a site serves more than a threshold number of bytes in a 24 hour period. Four sites are above the threshold. These are called alerts - occurrences of the condition being detected - and the alert name, status, time of detection, and duration of the condition are shown in this view. Alerts come and go from the list depending on whether the rule conditions are met.

When an alert is created, it generates actions. If the conditions that caused the alert persist, the actions run again according to the rule notification settings. There are two common alert statuses:

`active`:: The conditions for the rule are met, and actions should be generated according to the notification settings.
`recovered`:: The conditions for the rule are no longer met, and recovery actions should be generated.

You can suppress future actions for a specific alert by turning on the *Mute* toggle. If a muted alert no longer meets the rule conditions, it stays in the list to avoid generating actions if the conditions recur. You can also disable a rule, which stops it from running checks and clears any alerts it was tracking. You may want to disable rules that are not currently needed to reduce the load on {kib} and {es}.
