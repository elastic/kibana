=== {es} query

The {es} query rule type runs a user-configured {es} query, compares the number of matches to a configured threshold, and schedules actions to run when the threshold condition is met.

[float]
==== Create the rule

Fill in the <<defining-rules-general-details, rule details>>, then select *{es} query*.

[float]
==== Define the conditions

Define properties to detect the condition.

Index:: This clause requires an *index or index pattern* and a *time field* that will be used for the *time window*.
Size:: This clause specifies the number of documents to pass to the configured actions when the the threshold condition is met.
{es} query:: This clause specifies the ES DSL query to execute. The number of documents that match this query will be evaulated against the threshold
condition. Aggregations are not supported at this time. 
Threshold:: This clause defines a threshold value and a comparison operator  (`is above`, `is above or equals`, `is below`, `is below or equals`, or `is between`). The number of documents that match the specified query is compared to this threshold.
Time window:: This clause determines how far back to search for documents, using the *time field* set in the *index* clause. Generally this value should be set to a value higher than the *check every* value in the <<defining-rules-general-details, general rule details>>, to avoid gaps in detection.

==== Add action variables

<<defining-rules-actions-details, Add an action>> to run when the rule condition is met. The following variables are specific to the {es} query rule. You can also specify <<defining-rules-actions-variables, variables common to all rules>>.

`context.title`:: A preconstructed title for the rule. Example: `rule term match alert query matched`.
`context.message`:: A preconstructed message for the rule. Example: +
`rule 'term match alert' is active:` +
`- Value: 42` +
`- Conditions Met: count greater than 4 over 5m` +
`- Timestamp: 2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`

`context.group`:: The name of the action group associated with the condition. Example: `query matched`.
`context.date`:: The date, in ISO format, that the rule met the condition. Example: `2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`.
`context.value`:: The value of the rule that met the condition.
`context.conditions`:: A description of the condition. Example: `count greater than 4`.
`context.hits`:: The most recent ES documents that matched the query. Using the https://mustache.github.io/[Mustache] template array syntax, you can iterate over these hits to get values from the ES documents into your actions.

[float]
==== Test your query

Use the *Test query* feature to verify that your query DSL is valid.

* Valid queries are executed against the configured *index* using the configured *time window*. The number of documents that
match the query will be displayed.
