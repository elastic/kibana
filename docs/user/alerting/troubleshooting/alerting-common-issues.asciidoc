=== Common Issues

This page describes how to resolve common problems you might encounter with Alerting.

[float]
[[rules-small-check-interval-run-late]]
==== Rules with small check intervals run late

*Problem*

Rules with a small check interval, such as every two seconds, run later than scheduled.

*Solution*

Rules run as background tasks at a cadence defined by their *check interval*.
When a Rule *check interval* is smaller than the Task Manager <<task-manager-settings,`poll_interval`>>, the rule will run late.

Either tweak the <<task-manager-settings,{kib} Task Manager settings>> or increase the *check interval* of the rules in question.

For more details, see <<task-manager-health-scheduled-tasks-small-schedule-interval-run-late>>.


[float]
[[scheduled-rules-run-late]]
==== Rules with the inconsistent cadence

*Problem*

Scheduled rules run at an inconsistent cadence, often running late.

Actions run long after the status of a rule changes, sending a notification of the change too late.

*Solution*

Rules and actions run as background tasks by each {kib} instance at a default rate of ten tasks every three seconds.
When diagnosing issues related to Alerting, focus on the tasks that begin with `alerting:` and `actions:`.

Alerting tasks always begin with `alerting:`. For example, the `alerting:.index-threshold` tasks back the <<rule-type-index-threshold, index threshold stack rule>>.
Action tasks always begin with `actions:`. For example, the `actions:.index` tasks back the <<index-action-type, index action>>.

For more details on monitoring and diagnosing task execution in Task Manager, see <<task-manager-health-monitoring>>.

[float]
[[connector-tls-settings]]
==== Connectors have TLS errors when executing actions

*Problem*

When executing actions, a connector gets a TLS socket error when connecting to
the server.

*Solution*

Configuration options are available to specialize connections to TLS servers,
including ignoring server certificate validation, and providing certificate
authority data to verify servers using custom certificates.  For more details, 
see <<action-settings,Action settings>>.

[float]
[[rules-long-execution-time]]
==== Rules take a long time to run

*Problem* 

Rules  are taking a long time to execute and are impacting the overall health of your deployment.

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
By default, only users with a `superuser` role can query the {kib} event log because it is a system index. To enable additional users to execute this query, assign `read` privileges to the `.kibana-event-log*` index.
==============================================

*Solution*

Query for a list of rule ids, bucketed by their execution times:

// TEST

<1> This queries for rules executed in the last day. Update the values of `lte` and `gte` to query over a different time range.
<2> Use `event.provider: actions` to query for long-running action executions.
<3> Execution durations are stored as nanoseconds. This adds a runtime field to convert that duration into seconds.
<4> This interval buckets the `event.duration_in_seconds` runtime field into 1 second intervals. Update this value to change the granularity of the buckets. If you are unable to use runtime fields, make sure this aggregation targets `event.duration` and use nanoseconds for the interval.
<5> This retrieves the top 10 rule ids for this duration interval. Update this value to retrieve more rule ids.

This query returns the following:

<1> Most rule execution durations fall within the first bucket (0 - 1 seconds).
<2> A single rule with id `41893910-6bca-11eb-9e0d-85d233e3ee35` took between 30 and 31 seconds to execute.

Use the <<get-rule-api,Get Rule API>> to retrieve additional information about rules that take a long time to execute.

[float]
[[rule-cannot-decrypt-api-key]]
=== Rule cannot decrypt apiKey

*Problem*:

The rule fails to execute and has an `Unable to decrypt attribute "apiKey"` error.

*Solution*:

This error happens when the `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` value used to create the rule does not match the value used during rule execution. Depending on the scenario, there are different ways to solve this problem:

[cols="2*<"]
|===

| If the value in `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` was manually changed, and the previous encryption key is still known.
| Ensure any previous encryption key is included in the keys used for <<xpack-encryptedSavedObjects-keyRotation-decryptionOnlyKeys, decryption only>>.

| If another {kib} instance with a different encryption key connects to the cluster.
| The other {kib} instance might be trying to run the rule using a different encryption key than what the rule was created with. Ensure the encryption keys among all the {kib} instances are the same, and setting <<xpack-encryptedSavedObjects-keyRotation-decryptionOnlyKeys, decryption only keys>> for previously used encryption keys.

| If other scenarios don't apply.
| Generate a new API key for the rule by disabling then enabling the rule.
