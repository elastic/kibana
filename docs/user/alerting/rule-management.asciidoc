== Managing rules


The *Rules* tab provides a cross-app view of alerting. Different {kib} apps like {observability-guide}/create-alerts.html[*Observability*], {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules.html[*Security*], <<geo-alerting, *Maps*>> and <<xpack-ml, *Machine Learning*>> can offer their own rules. The *Rules* tab provides a central place to:

* <<create-edit-rules, Create and edit>> rules
* <<controlling-rules, Control rules>> including enabling/disabling, muting/unmuting, and deleting
* Drill-down to <<rule-details, rule details>>

=== Finding rules

The *Rules* tab lists all rules in the current space, including summary information about their execution frequency, tags, and type.

The *search bar* can be used to quickly find rules by name or tag.

=== Creating and editing rules

Many rules must be created within the context of a {kib} app like <<metrics-app, Metrics>>, <<xpack-apm, APM>>, or <<uptime-app, Uptime>>, but others are generic. Generic rule types can be created in the *Rules* management UI by clicking the *Create* button. This will launch a flyout that guides you through selecting a rule type and configuring its properties. Refer to <<stack-rules>> for details on what types of rules are available and how to configure them.

After a rule is created, you can re-open the flyout and change a rule's properties by clicking the *Edit* button shown on each row of the rule listing.

[[controlling-rules]]
=== Controlling rules

The rule listing allows you to quickly mute/unmute, disable/enable, and delete individual rules by clicking the action button.

These operations can also be performed in bulk by multi-selecting rules and clicking the *Manage rules* button:
