=== {es} query

The {es} query rule type runs a user-configured query, compares the number of 
matches to a configured threshold, and schedules actions to run when the 
threshold condition is met.


[float]
==== Create the rule

Fill in the <<defining-rules-general-details, rule details>>, then select 
*{es} query*.


[float]
==== Define the conditions

Define properties to detect the condition.

Index:: Specifies an *index or data view* and a *time field* that is used for 
the *time window*.
Size:: Specifies the number of documents to pass to the configured actions when 
the threshold condition is met.
{es} query:: Specifies the ES DSL query to execute. The number of documents that 
match this query is evaluated against the threshold condition. Only the `query` 
field is used, other DSL fields are not considered. 
Threshold:: Defines a threshold value and a comparison operator  (`is above`, 
`is above or equals`, `is below`, `is below or equals`, or `is between`). The 
number of documents that match the specified query is compared to this 
threshold.
Time window:: Defines how far back to search for documents, using the 
*time field* set in the *index* clause. Generally this value should be set to a 
value higher than the *check every* value in the 
<<defining-rules-general-details, general rule details>>, to avoid gaps in 
detection.

==== Add action variables

<<defining-rules-actions-details, Add an action>> to run when the rule condition 
is met. The following variables are specific to the {es} query rule. You can 
also specify 
<<defining-rules-actions-variables, variables common to all rules>>.

`context.title`:: A preconstructed title for the rule. Example: 
`rule term match alert query matched`.

`context.message`:: A preconstructed message for the rule. Example: +
`rule 'my es-query' is active:` +
`- Value: 2` +
`- Conditions Met: Number of matching documents is greater than 1 over 5m` +
`- Timestamp: 2022-02-03T20:29:27.732Z`

`context.group`:: The name of the action group associated with the condition. 
Example: `query matched`.

`context.date`:: The date, in ISO format, that the rule met the condition. 
Example: `2022-02-03T20:29:27.732Z`.

`context.value`:: The value of the rule that met the condition.

`context.conditions`:: A description of the condition. Example: 
`count greater than 4`.

`context.hits`:: The most recent documents that matched the query. Using the 
https://mustache.github.io/[Mustache] template array syntax, you can iterate 
over these hits to get values from the ES documents into your actions.

[float]
==== Test your query

Use the *Test query* feature to verify that your query DSL is valid.

* Valid queries are executed against the configured *index* using the configured 
*time window*. The number of documents that match the query is displayed.

* An error message is shown if the query is invalid.

==== Handling multiple matches of the same document

This rule type checks for duplication of document matches across rule 
executions. If you configure the rule with a schedule interval smaller than the 
time window, and a document matches a query in multiple rule executions, it is 
alerted on only once.

The rule uses the timestamp of the matches to avoid alerting on the same match 
multiple times. The timestamp of the latest match is used for evaluating the 
rule conditions when the rule is executed. Only matches between the latest 
timestamp from the previous execution and the actual rule execution are 
considered.

Suppose you have a rule configured to run every minute. The rule uses a time 
window of 1 hour and checks if there are more than 99 matches for the query. The 
{es} query rule type does the following:

[cols="3*<"]
|===
| `Execution 1 (0:00)`
| Rule finds 113 matches in the last hour: `113 > 99`
| Rule is active and user is alerted.
| `Execution 2 (0:01)`
| Rule finds 127 matches in the last hour. 105 of the matches are duplicates that were already alerted on previously, so you actually have 22 matches: `22 !> 99`
| No alert.
| `Execution 3 (0:02)`
| Rule finds 159 matches in the last hour. 88 of the matches are duplicates that were already alerted on previously, so you actually have 71 matches: `71 !> 99`
| No alert.
| `Execution 4 (0:03)`
| Rule finds 190 matches in the last hour. 71 of them are duplicates that were already alerted on previously, so you actually have 119 matches: `119 > 99`
| Rule is active and user is alerted.
