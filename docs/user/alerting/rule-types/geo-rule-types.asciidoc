== Tracking containment

The tracking containment rule alerts when an entity is contained or no longer contained within a boundary. 

[float]
=== Requirements
To create a tracking containment rule, the following requirements must be present:

- *Entities index*: An index containing a `geo_point` or `geo_shape` field, `date` field, and entity identifier. An entity identifier is a `keyword`, `number`, or `ip` field that identifies the entity. The data in this index should be dynamically updating so that there are entity movements to alert upon.
- *Boundaries index*: An index containing `geo_shape` data.
This data is presumed to be static (not updating). Boundaries are collected once when the rule is created and anytime after when the rule is re-enabled after disablement.

Entity locations are queried to determine if they are contained within any monitored boundaries.
Entity data should be somewhat "real time", meaning the dates of new documents aren’t older
than the current time minus the amount of the interval. If data older than
`now - <current interval>` is ingested, it won't trigger a rule.

=== Actions

A rule can be triggered either when a containment condition is met or when an entity is no longer contained.
