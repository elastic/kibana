=== Alerts with Small Check Intervals Run Late

*Symptoms*:

Alerts are scheduled to run every 2 seconds but they seem to be running too late

*Resolution*:

As described under <<alerting-background-tasks>>, Alerts are ran as background tasks at a cadence defined by their *check interval*.
This issue can be addressed by either tweaking the {kib} Task Manager settings or adjusting the Alerts in question.

For details on resolving this issue please see <<task-manager-health-scheduled-tasks-small-schedule-interval-run-late>>.

=== Alerts Run Late

*Symptoms*:

Scheduled Alerts run at an inconsistent cadence, often running late.

Actions run long after the status of an Alert changes, notifying us of the change too late.

*Resolution*:

As described under <<alerting-background-tasks>>, Alerts and Actions are ran as background tasks ran by each {kib} instance at a default rate of 10 tasks every 3 seconds.

This means that if there are many alerts or actions that have been scheduled to run at the same time, pending tasks will queue in {es}. Each {kib} instance then polls for pending tasks at a rate of up to 10 concurrent tasks at a time, at 3 second intervals. As Alerts and Actions are backed by tasks, it is possible for pending tasks in the queue to exceed this capacity and run late as a result.

For details on diagnosing the underlying causes of such delays, please see <<task-manager-health-tasks-run-late>>.

Alerting and Action tasks can be identified amongst the variety of tasks in {kib} by their type.

* Alert tasks always begin with `alerting:`. For example, the `alerting:.index-threshold` tasks back the <<alert-type-index-threshold, Index Threshold Stack Alert>>.
* Action tasks always begin with `actions:`. For example, the `actions:.index` tasks back the <<index-action-type>>.

When diagnosing Alerting related issue, this subset of the tasks in the system may be of particular interest.

For broader details on monitoring and diagnosing task execution in Task Manager, see <<task-manager-health-monitoring>>.
