[[rules-small-check-interval-run-late]]
=== Rules with small check intervals run late

*Problem*:

Rules with a small check interval, such as every two seconds, run later than scheduled.

*Resolution*:

Rules run as background tasks at a cadence defined by their *check interval*.
When a Rule *check interval* is smaller than the Task Manager <<task-manager-settings,`poll_interval`>> the rule will run late.

Either tweak the <<task-manager-settings,{kib} Task Manager settings>> or increase the *check interval* of the rules in question.

[[scheduled-rules-run-late]]
=== Rules run late

*Problem*:

Scheduled rules run at an inconsistent cadence, often running late.

Actions run long after the status of a rule changes, sending a notification of the change too late.

*Solution*:

Rules and actions run as background tasks by each {kib} instance at a default rate of ten tasks every three seconds.

If many rules or actions are scheduled to run at the same time, pending tasks will queue in {es}. Each {kib} instance then polls for pending tasks at a rate of up to ten tasks at a time, at three second intervals. Because rules and actions are backed by tasks, it is possible for pending tasks in the queue to exceed this capacity and run late.

For details on diagnosing the underlying causes of such delays, see <<task-manager-health-tasks-run-late>>.

Alerting and action tasks are identified by their type.

* Alerting tasks always begin with `alerting:`. For example, the `alerting:.index-threshold` tasks back the <<rule-type-index-threshold, index threshold stack rule>>.
* Action tasks always begin with `actions:`. For example, the `actions:.index` tasks back the <<index-action-type, index action>>.

When diagnosing issues related to Alerting, focus on the tasks that begin with `alerting:` and `actions:`.

For more details on monitoring and diagnosing task execution in Task Manager, see <<task-manager-health-monitoring>>.
