[[alerts-small-check-interval-run-late]]
=== Alerts with small check intervals run late

*Problem*:

Alerts with a small check interval, such as every two seconds, run later than scheduled.

*Resolution*:

Alerts run as background tasks at a cadence defined by their *check interval*.
When an Alert *check interval* is smaller than the Task Manager <<task-manager-settings,`poll_interval`>> the alert will run late.

Either tweak the <<task-manager-settings,{kib} Task Manager settings>> or increase the *check interval* of the alerts in question.

[[scheduled-alerts-run-late]]
=== Alerts run late

*Problem*:

Scheduled alerts run at an inconsistent cadence, often running late.

Actions run long after the status of an alert changes, sending a notification of the change too late.

*Solution*:

Alerts and actions run as background tasks by each {kib} instance at a default rate of ten tasks every three seconds.

If many alerts or actions are scheduled to run at the same time, pending tasks will queue in {es}. Each {kib} instance then polls for pending tasks at a rate of up to ten tasks at a time, at three second intervals. Because alerts and actions are backed by tasks, it is possible for pending tasks in the queue to exceed this capacity and run late.

For details on diagnosing the underlying causes of such delays, see <<task-manager-health-tasks-run-late>>.

Alerting and action tasks are identified by their type.

* Alert tasks always begin with `alerting:`. For example, the `alerting:.index-threshold` tasks back the <<alert-type-index-threshold, index threshold stack alert>>.
* Action tasks always begin with `actions:`. For example, the `actions:.index` tasks back the <<index-action-type, index action>>.

When diagnosing issues related to Alerting, focus on the thats that begin with `alerting:` and `actions:`.

For more details on monitoring and diagnosing task execution in Task Manager, see <<task-manager-health-monitoring>>.
