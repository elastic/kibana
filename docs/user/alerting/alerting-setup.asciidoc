Alerting is automatically enabled in {kib}, but might require some additional configuration.

[float]
[[alerting-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites
If you are using an *on-premises* Elastic Stack deployment:

* In the kibana.yml configuration file, add the <<general-alert-action-settings,`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`>> setting.
* For emails to have a footer with a link back to {kib}, set the <<server-publicBaseUrl, `server.publicBaseUrl`>> configuration setting.

If you are using an *on-premises* Elastic Stack deployment with <<using-kibana-with-security, *security*>>:

* If you are unable to access {kib} Alerting, ensure that you have not {ref}/security-settings.html#api-key-service-settings[explicitly disabled API keys].

The alerting framework uses queries that require the `search.allow_expensive_queries` setting to be `true`. See the scripts {ref}/query-dsl-script-query.html#_allow_expensive_queries_4[documentation].

=== Production considerations and scaling guidance

When relying on alerting and actions as mission critical services, make sure you follow the <<alerting-production-considerations,Alerting production considerations>>.

See <<alerting-scaling-guidance>> for more information on the scalability of Alerting.

[float]
[[alerting-security]]
=== Security

To access alerting in a space, a user must have access to one of the following features:

* Alerting
* <<xpack-apm,*APM*>>
* <<logs-app,*Logs*>>
* <<xpack-ml,*{ml-cap}*>>
* <<metrics-app,*Metrics*>>
* <<xpack-siem,*Security*>>
* <<uptime-app,*Uptime*>>

See <<kibana-feature-privileges, feature privileges>> for more information on configuring roles that provide access to these features.
Also note that a user will need +read+ privileges for the *Actions and Connectors* feature to attach actions to a rule or to edit a rule that has an action attached to it.

[float]
[[alerting-restricting-actions]]
==== Restrict actions

For security reasons you may wish to limit the extent to which {kib} can connect to external services. <<action-settings>> allows you to disable certain <<action-types>> and allowlist the hostnames that {kib} can connect with.

[float]
[[alerting-spaces]]
=== Space isolation

Rules and connectors are isolated to the {kib} space in which they were created. A rule or connector created in one space will not be visible in another. 

[float]
[[alerting-authorization]]
=== Authorization

Rules are authorized using an <<api-keys, API key>> associated with the last user to edit the rule. This API key captures a snapshot of the user's privileges at the time of edit and is subsequently used to run all background tasks associated with the rule, including condition checks, like {es} queries, and action executions. The following rule actions will re-generate the API key:

* Creating a rule
* Enabling a disabled rule
* Updating a rule

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
If a rule requires certain privileges, such as index privileges, to run, and a user without those privileges updates, disables, or re-enables the rule, the rule will no longer function. Conversely, if a user with greater or administrator privileges modifies the rule, it will begin running with increased privileges.
==============================================
