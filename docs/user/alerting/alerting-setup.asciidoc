Alerting is automatically enabled in {kib}, but might require some additional 
configuration.

[[alerting-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites
If you are using an *on-premises* Elastic Stack deployment:

* In the kibana.yml configuration file, add the 
<<general-alert-action-settings,`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`>> 
setting.
* For emails to have a footer with a link back to {kib}, set the 
<<server-publicBaseUrl, `server.publicBaseUrl`>> configuration setting.

If you are using an *on-premises* Elastic Stack deployment with 
<<using-kibana-with-security, *security*>>:

* If you are unable to access {kib} Alerting, ensure that you have not 
{ref}/security-settings.html#api-key-service-settings[explicitly disabled API keys].

The alerting framework uses queries that require the 
`search.allow_expensive_queries` setting to be `true`. See the scripts 
{ref}/query-dsl-script-query.html#_allow_expensive_queries_4[documentation].

[[alerting-setup-production]]
=== Production considerations and scaling guidance

When relying on alerting and actions as mission critical services, make sure you 
follow the 
<<alerting-production-considerations,Alerting production considerations>>.

See <<alerting-scaling-guidance>> for more information on the scalability of 
Alerting.

[[alerting-security]]
=== Security

To access alerting in a space, a user must have access to one of the following 
features:

* Alerting
* <<xpack-apm,*APM*>>
* <<logs-app,*Logs*>>
* <<xpack-ml,*{ml-cap}*>>
* <<metrics-app,*Metrics*>>
* <<xpack-siem,*Security*>>
* <<uptime-app,*Uptime*>>

See <<kibana-feature-privileges, feature privileges>> for more information on 
configuring roles that provide access to these features.
Also note that a user will need +read+ privileges for the 
*Actions and Connectors* feature to attach actions to a rule or to edit a rule 
that has an action attached to it.

[float]
[[alerting-restricting-actions]]
==== Restrict actions

For security reasons you may wish to limit the extent to which {kib} can connect 
to external services. <<action-settings>> allows you to disable certain 
<<action-types>> and allowlist the hostnames that {kib} can connect with.

[float]
[[alerting-spaces]]
=== Space isolation

Rules and connectors are isolated to the {kib} space in which they were created. 
A rule or connector created in one space will not be visible in another. 

[float]
[[alerting-authorization]]
=== Authorization

Rules are authorized using an <<api-keys,API key>> associated with the last user 
to edit the rule. This API key captures a snapshot of the user's privileges at 
the time of the edit. They are subsequently used to run all background tasks 
associated with the rule, including condition checks like {es} queries and 
triggered actions. The following rule actions will re-generate the API key:

* Creating a rule
* Updating a rule

When you disable a rule, it retains the associated API key which is re-used when 
the rule is enabled. If the API key is missing when you enable the rule (for 
example, in the case of imported rules), it generates a new key that has your 
security privileges.

You can update an API key manually in 
**{stack-manage-app} > {rules-ui}** or in the rule details page by selecting 
**Update API key** in the actions menu.

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
If a rule requires certain privileges, such as index privileges, to run, and a 
user without those privileges updates the rule, the rule will no longer 
function. Conversely, if a user with greater or administrator privileges 
modifies the rule, it will begin running with increased privileges.
==============================================
