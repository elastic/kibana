[[alert-status]]
=== Alert statuses

When an alert is created, it generates actions.
If the conditions that caused the alert persist, the actions run again according to the rule notification settings.
There are four common alert statuses:

`active`:: The conditions for the rule are met and actions should be generated according to the notification settings.
`flapping`:: The alert is switching repeatedly between active and recovered states.
`recovered`:: The conditions for the rule are no longer met and recovery actions should be generated.
`untracked`:: Actions are no longer generated. For example, you can choose to move active alerts to this state when you disable or delete rules.

[NOTE]
====
The `flapping` state is possible only if you have enabled alert flapping detection in *{stack-manage-app} > {rules-ui} > Settings*. For each space, you can choose a look back window and threshold that are used to determine whether alerts are flapping. For example, you can specify that the alert must change status at least 6 times in the last 10 runs. If the rule has actions that run when the alert status changes, those actions are suppressed while the alert is flapping.
====

If an alert was affected by a maintenance window, its identifier appears in the *Maintenance windows* column.
For more information about their impact on alert notifications, refer to <<maintenance-windows>>.

[[mute-alerts]]
=== Mute alerts

You can mute an alert to temporarily suppress future actions.
Open the action menu (â€¦) for the appropriate alert in the table and select *Mute*.
To permanently suppress actions for an alert, open the actions menu and select *Mark as untracked*.

To affect the behavior of the rule rather than individual alerts, check out <<controlling-rules>>.
