== Preconfigured connectors

You can preconfigure an action connector to have all the information it needs prior to startup
by adding it to the `kibana.yml` file.
Sensitive configuration information, such as credentials, can use the {kib} keystore.

Preconfigured connectors offer the following capabilities:

- Require no setup. Configuration and credentials needed to execute an
action are predefined, including the connector name and ID.
- Appear in all spaces because they are not saved objects.
- Cannot be edited or deleted.

=== Example of a preconfigured connector

The following example shows a valid configuration 2 out-of-the box connector.

```js
  xpack.actions.preconfigured:
    - id: 'my-slack1'           <1>
      actionTypeId: .slack      <2>
      name: 'Slack #xyz'        <3>
      config:                   <4>
        webhookUrl: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/abcd/efgh/ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    - id: 'webhook-service'
      actionTypeId: .webhook
      name: 'Email service'
      config:
        url: 'https://email-alert-service.elastic.co'
        method: post
        headers:
          header1: value1
          header2: value2
      secrets:                  <5>
        user: elastic
        password: changeme
```

<1> `id` is the action connector identifier.
<2> `actionTypeId` is the action type identifier.
<3> `name` is the name of the preconfigured connector.
<4> `config` is the action type specific to the configuration.
<5> `secrets` is sensitive configuration, such as username, password, and keys.

[NOTE]
==============================================
Sensitive properties, such as passwords, can also be stored in the {kib} keystore.

The dropdown is populated with additional preconfigured Slack connectors.
The `preconfigured` label distinguishes them from space-aware connectors that use saved objects.
