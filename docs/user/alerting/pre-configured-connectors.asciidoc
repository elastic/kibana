== Preconfigured connectors and action types

You can preconfigure an action type or a connector to have all the information it needs prior to startup
by adding it to the `kibana.yml` file.

Preconfigured connectors offer the following capabilities:

- Require no setup. Configuration and credentials needed to execute an
action are predefined, including the connector name and ID.
- Appear in all spaces because they are not saved objects.
- Cannot be edited or deleted.

Sensitive configuration information, such as credentials, can use the <<creating-keystore, {kib} keystore>>.

A preconfigured action types has only preconfigured connectors. Preconfigured connectors can belong to either the preconfigured action type or to the regular action type.

=== Creating a preconfigured connector

The following example shows a valid configuration of two out-of-the box connectors: <<slack-action-type, Slack>> and <<webhook-action-type, Webhook>>.

```js
  xpack.actions.preconfigured:
    my-slack1:                  <1>
      actionTypeId: .slack      <2>
      name: 'Slack #xyz'        <3>
      config:                   <4>
        webhookUrl: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/abcd/efgh/ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    webhook-service:
      actionTypeId: .webhook
      name: 'Email service'
      config:
        url: 'https://email-alert-service.elastic.co'
        method: post
        headers:
          header1: value1
          header2: value2
      secrets:                  <5>
        user: elastic
        password: changeme
```

<1> the key is the action connector identifier, eg `my-slack1` in this example.
<2> `actionTypeId` is the action type identifier.
<3> `name` is the name of the preconfigured connector.
<4> `config` is the action type specific to the configuration.
<5> `secrets` is sensitive configuration, such as username, password, and keys.

[NOTE]
==============================================
Sensitive properties, such as passwords, can also be stored in the <<creating-keystore, {kib} keystore>>.

=== Creating a preconfigured action type

In the `kibana.yml` file:

. Exclude the action type from `xpack.actions.enabledActionTypes`.
. Add all its preconfigured connectors.

The following example shows a valid configuration of preconfigured action type with one out-of-the box connector.

```js
  xpack.actions.enabledActionTypes: ['.slack', '.email', '.index'] <1>
  xpack.actions.preconfigured:                                     <2>
    my-server-log:
      actionTypeId: .server-log
      name: 'Server log #xyz'
```

<1> `enabledActionTypes` should exclude preconfigured action type to prevent creating and deleting connectors.
<2> `preconfigured` is the setting for defining the list of available connectors for the preconfigured action type.

The dropdown is populated with additional preconfigured Slack connectors.
The `preconfigured` label distinguishes them from space-aware connectors that use saved objects.
