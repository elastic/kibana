== Stack rule types

Kibana provides two types of rules:

* Stack rules, which are built into {kib}
* <<domain-specific-rules, Domain-specific rules>>, which are registered by {kib} apps.

{kib} provides two stack rules: 

* <<rule-type-index-threshold>>
* <<rule-type-es-query>>

Users require the `all` privilege to access the *Stack Rules* feature and create and edit rules.
See <<kibana-feature-privileges, feature privileges>> for more information.

[NOTE]
==============================================
Some rule types are subscription features, while others are free features.
For a comparison of the Elastic subscription levels,
see {subscriptions}[the subscription page].
