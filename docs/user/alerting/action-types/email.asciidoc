[[email-connector-configuration]]
==== Connector configuration

Email connectors have the following configuration properties:

Name::      The name of the connector. The name is used to identify a  connector in the management UI connector listing, or in the connector list when configuring an action.
Sender::    The from address for all emails sent with this connector, specified in `user@host-name` format.
Host::      Host name of the service provider. If you are using the <<action-settings, `xpack.actions.allowedHosts`>> setting, make sure this hostname is added to the allowed hosts.
Port::      The port to connect to on the service provider.
Secure::    If true, the connection will use TLS when connecting to the service provider. Refer to the https://nodemailer.com/smtp/#tls-options[Nodemailer TLS documentation] for more information.  If not true, the connection will initially connect over TCP, then attempt to switch to TLS via the SMTP STARTTLS command.
Username::  username for 'login' type authentication.
Password::  password for 'login' type authentication.

[[email-action-configuration]]
==== Action configuration

Email actions have the following configuration properties:

To, CC, BCC::    Each is a list of addresses. Addresses can be specified in `user@host-name` format, or in `name <user@host-name>` format. One of To, CC, or BCC must contain an entry.
Subject::       The subject line of the email.
Message::       The message text of the email. Markdown format is supported.

[[configuring-email]]
==== Configuring email accounts

The email action can send email using many popular SMTP email services.

You configure the email action to send emails using the connector form.
For more information about configuring the email connector to work with different email
systems, refer to:

* <<gmail>>
* <<outlook>>
* <<exchange>>
* <<amazon-ses>>

For other email servers, you can check the list of well-known services that Nodemailer supports in the JSON file https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/blob/master/lib/well-known/services.json[well-known/services.json].  The properties of the objects in those files &mdash; `host`, `port`, and `secure` &mdash; correspond to the same email action configuration properties.  A missing `secure` property in the "well-known/services.json" file is considered `false`.  Typically, `port: 465` uses `secure: true`, and `port: 25` and `port: 587` use `secure: false`.

[[gmail]]
===== Sending email from Gmail

Use the following email account settings to send email from the
https://mail.google.com[Gmail] SMTP service:

--------------------------------------------------

If you get an authentication error that indicates that you need to continue the
sign-in process from a web browser when the action attempts to send email, you need
to configure Gmail to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en[allow
less secure apps to access your account].

If two-step verification is enabled for your account, you must generate and use
a unique App Password to send email from {watcher}. See

When sending emails, you must provide a from address, either as the default
