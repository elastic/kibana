== Rule types

A rule is a set of <<alerting-concepts-conditions, conditions>>, <<alerting-concepts-scheduling, schedules>>, and <<alerting-concepts-actions, actions>> that enable notifications. {kib} provides two types of rules:  rules specific to the Elastic Stack and rules specific to a domain.

[NOTE]
==============================================
Some rule types are subscription features, while others are free features.
For a comparison of the Elastic subscription levels,
see {subscriptions}[the subscription page].

[[stack-rules]]
=== Stack rules

<<alert-management, Stack rules>> are built into {kib}.  To access the *Stack Rules* feature and create and edit rules, users require the `all` privilege. See <<kibana-feature-privileges, feature privileges>> for more information.

| <<rule-type-es-query>>
| Run a user-configured {es} query, compare the number of matches to a configured threshold, and schedule actions to run when the threshold condition is met.

| {observability-guide}/create-alerts.html[Observability rules]
| Detect complex conditions in the *Logs*, *Metrics*, and *Uptime* apps.

| {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules.html[Security rules]
| Detect suspicous source events with pre-built or custom rules and create alerts when a ruleâ€™s conditions are met.

| <<geo-alerting, Maps rules>>
| Run an {es} query to determine if any documents are currently contained in any boundaries from a specified boundary index and generate alerts when a rule's conditions are met.

| {ml-docs}/ml-configuring-alerts.html[{ml-cap} rules] beta:[]
