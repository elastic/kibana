== Preconfigured action types

A preconfigure an action type has all the information it needs prior to startup.
A preconfigured action type offers the following capabilities:

- Requires no setup. Configuration and credentials needed to execute an
action are predefined.
- Has only <<pre-configured-connectors, preconfigured connectors>>.
- Connectors of the preconfigured action type cannot be edited or deleted.

=== Creating a preconfigured action

In the `kibana.yml` file:

. Exclude the action type from `xpack.actions.enabledActionTypes`.
. Add all its connectors.

The following example shows a valid configuration of preconfigured action type with one out-of-the box connector.

```js
  xpack.actions.enabledActionTypes: ['.slack', '.email', '.index'] <1>
  xpack.actions.preconfigured:                                     <2>
    - id: 'my-server-log'
      actionTypeId: .server-log
      name: 'Server log #xyz'
```

<1> `enabledActionTypes` should exclude preconfigured action type to prevent creating and deleting connectors.
<2> `preconfigured` is the setting for defining the list of available connectors for the preconfigured action type.

=== Managing preconfigured actions

Connectors with preconfigured actions appear in the connector list, regardless of which space the user is in.
They are tagged as “preconfigured” and cannot be deleted.

Clicking *Create connector* shows the list of available action types.
Preconfigured action types are not included because you can't create a connector with a preconfigured action type.
