_Visualize_ enables you to create visualizations of the data from your {es} indices, which you can then add to dashboards for analysis.

{kib} visualizations are based on {es} queries. By using a series of {es} {ref}/search-aggregations.html[aggregations] to extract and process your data, you can create charts that show you the trends, spikes, and dips you need to know about.

[[create-a-visualization]]
== Create visualizations

. Open *Visualize*.
. Click *Create new visualization*.
. Choose the visualization type:
+
* Basic charts
[horizontal]
<<lens,Lens>>::
Quickly build several types of basic visualizations by simply dragging and dropping the data fields you want to display.

* *<<most-frequent,Most frequently used visualizations>>*
[horizontal]
Line&comma; area, and bar charts:: Compare different series in X/Y charts.

Pie chart:: Display each source contribution to a total.

Data table:: Flattens aggregations into table format.

Metric:: Display a single number.

Goal and gauge:: Display a number with progress indicators.

Tag cloud:: Display words in a cloud, where the size of the word corresponds to its importance.

* *Time series optimized*
[horizontal]
<<TSVB,TSVB>>:: Visualize time series data using pipeline aggregations.

<<timelion,Timelion>>:: Compute and combine data from multiple time series
data sets.

* *Maps*
[horizontal]
<<maps,Elastic Maps>>:: The most powerful way of visualizing map data in {kib}.

<<tilemap,Coordinate map>>:: Displays points on a map using a geohash aggregation.

<<regionmap,Region map>>:: Merge any structured map data onto a shape.

<<heatmap,Heat map>>:: Display shaded cells within a matrix.

* *<<for-dashboard,Dashboard tools>>*
[horizontal]
<<for-dashboard,Controls>>:: Provides the ability to add interactive inputs to a Dashboard.

<<for-dashboard,Markdown widget>>:: Display free-form information or instructions.

* *For developers*
[horizontal]
<<vega-graph,Vega>>:: Complete control over query and display.

. Specify a search query to retrieve the data for your visualization:
** To enter new search criteria, select the <<index-patterns, index pattern>> for the indices that
contain the data you want to visualize. The visualization builder opens
with a wildcard query that matches all of the documents in the selected
indices.
** To build a visualization from a saved search, click the name of the saved
search you want to use. The visualization builder opens and loads the
selected query.
+
NOTE: When you build a visualization from a saved search, any subsequent
modifications to the saved search are automatically reflected in the
visualization. To disable automatic updates, you can disconnect a visualization
from the saved search.

[float]
[[vis-inspector]]
== Inspect visualizations

Many visualizations allow you to inspect the query and data behind the visualization.

. In the {kib} toolbar, click *Inspect*.
. To download the data, click *Download CSV*, then choose one of the following options:
* *Formatted CSV* - Downloads the data in table format.
* *Raw CSV* - Downloads the data as provided.
. To view the requests for collecting data, select *Requests* from the *View*
dropdown.

[float]
[[save-visualize]]
== Save visualizations
To use your visualizations in <<dashboard, dashboards>>, you must save them.

. In the {kib} toolbar, click *Save*.
. Enter the visualization *Title* and optional *Description*, then *Save* the visualization.

To access the saved visualization, go to *Management > {kib} > Saved Objects*.

[float]
[[save-visualization-read-only-access]]
==== Read only access
When you have insufficient privileges to save visualizations, the following indicator is
displayed and the *Save* button is not visible.

For more information, refer to <<xpack-security-authorization>>.

[float]
[[visualize-share-options]]
== Share visualizations

When you've finished your visualization, you can share it outside of {kib}.

From the *Share* menu, you can:

* Embed the code in a web page. Users must have {kib} access
to view an embedded visualization.
* Share a direct link to a {kib} visualization.
* Generate a PDF report.
* Generate a PNG report.
