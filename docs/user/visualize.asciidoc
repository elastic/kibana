[[visualize]]
= Visualize

[partintro]
--
_Visualize_ enables you to create visualizations of the data from your {es} indices, which you can then add to dashboards for analysis.

{kib} visualizations are based on {es} queries. By using a series of {es} {ref}/search-aggregations.html[aggregations] to extract and process your data, you can create charts that show you the trends, spikes, and dips you need to know about.

To begin, open the menu, go to *Visualize*, then click *Create visualization*.

[[visualization-types]]
== Types of visualizations

{kib} supports several types of visualizations.

<<lens,Lens>>::
Quickly build several types of basic visualizations by simply dragging and dropping the data fields you want to display.

<<most-frequent,Most frequently used visualizations>>::

* *Line, area, and bar charts* &mdash; Compares different series in X/Y charts.

* *Pie chart* &mdash; Displays each source contribution to a total.

* *Data table* &mdash; Flattens aggregations into table format.

* *Metric* &mdash; Displays a single number.

* *Goal and gauge* &mdash; Displays a number with progress indicators.

* *Tag cloud* &mdash; Displays words in a cloud, where the size of the word corresponds to its importance.

<<TSVB,TSVB>>:: Visualizes time series data using pipeline aggregations.

<<timelion,Timelion>>:: Computes and combine data from multiple time series
data sets.

<<visualize-maps, Maps>>::
* *<<maps,Maps>>* &mdash; Displays geospatial data in {kib}.

* <<heat-map,Heat map>>:: Display shaded cells within a matrix.

<<for-dashboard,Dashboard tools>>::

* *Markdown widget* &mdash; Displays free-form information or instructions.

* *Controls* &mdash; Adds interactive inputs to a dashboard.

<<vega-graph,Vega>>:: Completes control over query and display.

[[choose-your-data]]
== Choose your data

Specify a search query to retrieve the data for your visualization, or used rolled up data.

* To enter new search criteria, select the <<index-patterns, index pattern>> for the indices that
contain the data you want to visualize. The visualization builder opens
with a wildcard query that matches all of the documents in the selected
indices.

* To build a visualization from a saved search, click the name of the saved
search you want to use. The visualization builder opens and loads the
selected query.
+
NOTE: When you build a visualization from a saved search, any subsequent
modifications to the saved search are reflected in the
visualization. To disable automatic updates, delete the visualization
on the *Saved Object* page.

* To build a visualization using <<rollup-index-pattern,rolled up data>>, select
the index pattern that includes the data. Rolled up data is summarized into
time buckets that can be split into sub buckets for numeric field values or
terms. To lower granularity, use a time aggregation that uses and combines
several time buckets. For an example, refer to <<rollup-data-tutorial,Create and visualize rolled up data>>.

[float]
[[vis-inspector]]
== Inspect visualizations

Many visualizations allow you to inspect the query and data behind the visualization.

. In the {kib} toolbar, click *Inspect*.
. To download the data, click *Download CSV*, then choose one of the following options:
* *Formatted CSV* - Downloads the data in table format.
* *Raw CSV* - Downloads the data as provided.
. To view the requests for collecting data, select *Requests* from the *View*
dropdown.

[float]
[[save-visualize]]
== Save visualizations
To use your visualizations in <<dashboard, dashboards>>, you must save them.

. In the {kib} toolbar, click *Save*.
. Enter the visualization *Title* and optional *Description*, then *Save* the visualization.

To access the saved visualization, go to *Management > {kib} > Saved Objects*.

[float]
[[save-visualization-read-only-access]]
==== Read only access
When you have insufficient privileges to save visualizations, the following indicator is
displayed and the *Save* button is not visible.

For more information, refer to <<xpack-security-authorization>>.

[float]
[[visualize-share-options]]
== Share visualizations

When you've finished your visualization, you can share it outside of {kib}.

From the *Share* menu, you can:

* Embed the code in a web page. Users must have {kib} access
to view an embedded visualization.
* Share a direct link to a {kib} visualization.
* Generate a PDF report.
* Generate a PNG report.
