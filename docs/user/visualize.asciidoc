_Visualize_ enables you to create visualizations of the data from your Elasticsearch indices, which you can then add to dashboards for analysis.

{kib} visualizations are based on Elasticsearch queries. By using a series of {es} {ref}/search-aggregations.html[aggregations] to extract and process your data, you can create charts that show you the trends, spikes, and dips you need to know about.

== Create visualizations

. Open *Visualize*.
. Click *Create new visualization*.
. Choose the visualization type:
+
* *Basic charts*
<<lens,Lens>>:: Quickly build several types of basic visualizations by simply dragging and dropping the data fields you want to display.
* *<<most-frequent,Most frequently used visualizations>>*
[horizontal]
Line&comma; area, and bar charts:: Compare different series in X/Y charts.
Pie chart:: Display each source contribution to a total.
Data table:: Flattens aggregations into table format.
Metric:: Display a single number.
Goal and gauge:: Display a number with progress indicators.
Heat maps:: Display shaded cells within a matrix.
Tag cloud:: Display words in a cloud, where the size of the word corresponds to its importance.
* *Time series optimized*
[horizontal]
<<TSVB,TSVB>>:: Visualize time series data using pipeline aggregations.
<<timelion,Timelion>>:: Compute and combine data from multiple time series
data sets.
* *Maps*
[horizontal]
<<maps, Elastic maps>>:: The most powerful way of visualizing map data in {kib}.
<<tilemap,_Coordinate map_>>:: Displays points on a map using a geohash aggregation.
<<regionmap,_Region map_>>:: Merge any structured map data onto a shape.
* *<<for-dashboard, For use in dashboards>>*
[horizontal]
<<for-dashboard,Controls>>:: Provides the ability to add interactive inputs to a Dashboard.
<<for-dashboard,Markdown widget>>:: Display free-form information or instructions.
* *For developers*
[horizontal]
<<vega-graph,Vega>>:: Complete control over query and display.

. Specify a search query to retrieve the data for your visualization:
** To enter new search criteria, select the <<index-patterns, index pattern>> for the indices that
contain the data you want to visualize. This opens the visualization builder
with a wildcard query that matches all of the documents in the selected
indices.
** To build a visualization from a saved search, click the name of the saved
search you want to use. This opens the visualization builder and loads the
selected query.
+
NOTE: When you build a visualization from a saved search, any subsequent
modifications to the saved search are automatically reflected in the
visualization. To disable automatic updates, you can disconnect a visualization
from the saved search.
