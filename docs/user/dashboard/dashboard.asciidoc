Dashboards are the best way to visualize and share insights from your {es} data. 

// add link to reference of panel types
A **dashboard** is made of one or more **panels** that you can organize as you like. Each panel can display various types of content: _visualizations_ such as charts, tables, metrics, and maps, _static annotations_ like text or images, or even _specialized views_ for Machine Learning or Observability data.

// add link to create section or list of editors
There are several <<panels-editors,panel editors>> in {kib} that let you create and configure different types of visualizations.

// add link to sharing section
At any time, you can <<share-the-dashboard,share a dashboard>> you've created with your team, in {kib} or outside.

Some dashboards are created and managed by the system, and are identified as `managed` in your list of of dashboards. This generally happens when you set up an integration to add data. You can't edit managed dashboards directly, but you can duplicate them and edit these duplicates.
