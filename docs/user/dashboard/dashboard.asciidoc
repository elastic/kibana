**_Visualize your data with dashboards._**

The best way to understand your data is to visualize it. With dashboards, you can turn your data from one or more <<data-views, data views>> into a collection of panels 
that bring clarity to your data, tell a story about your data, and allow you to focus on only the data that's important to you.

Panels display your data in charts, tables, maps, and more, which allow you to compare your data side-by-side to identify patterns and connections. Dashboards support several types of panels to display your data, and several options to create panels.
