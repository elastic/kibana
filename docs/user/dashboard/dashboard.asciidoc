**_Visualize your data with dashboards._**

The best way to understand your data is to visualize it. With dashboards, you can turn your data from one or more <<index-patterns, index patterns>> into a collection of panels 
that bring clarity to your data, tell a story about your data, and allow you to focus on only the data that's important to you. Configure each panel to display your data in a chart, table, map, and more, 
then compare the panels side-by-side to identify the patterns and connections in your data.

Dashboards support many types of panels, and provide several editors that you can use to create panels.

[cols="2"]
|===

| <<create-panels-with-editors,Visualization editors>>
| Use the *Lens*, *TSVB*, *Vega*, and *Timelion* editors to help you create visualizations of your data, or create aggregation-based visualizations using {es} <<aggregation-reference,aggregations>>. 
*Lens* is recommended for most users.

| <<maps,Maps>>
| Create beautiful displays of your geographical data.

| <<enhance-dashboards,Tools>>
| Add context to your panels with <<add-text,text>>, or add dynamic filters with <<add-controls,*Controls*>>.

| <<save-your-search,Saved search from Discover>>
| Display a saved search table from <<discover, *Discover*>>. The table results are not aggregated.

| <<logs-app,Log stream>>
| Display a table of live streaming logs.

| <<xpack-ml-anomalies,ML Anomaly Swim Lane>>
| Display the results from machine learning anomaly detection jobs.
