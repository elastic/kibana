A _dashboard_ is a collection of panels that you use to analyze your data. On a dashboard, add a variety of panels, then rearrange 
the panels to tell a story about your data. Panels contain everything you need, including visualizations,
interactive controls, markdown, and more.

With *Dashboard*, you can:

* Add multiple types of panels and view various aspects of your data in one place, then arrange the panels to compare your data. 

* Add text and images to provide context to the panels.

* Create and apply filters to focus in on the data you want to display.

* Control who can use your data, and share the dashboard with a small or large audience.

* Generate reports based on your findings.

To begin, open the main menu, then click *Dashboard*.
