Dashboards are collections of panels that you configure and arrange to visualize and analyze your data. Each panel contains data from one or more index patterns, which allows 
you to create a complete overview of your data on a single dashboard. To gain insights into your data, {kib} supports many types of panels that enable you to see your data from multiple perspectives.

To create visualization panels of your data, {kib} provides you with a visualization builder where you drag and drop 
data fields, then {kib} uses heuristics to apply each field and automatically create visualizations for you.

== Prerequisites

To build dashboards, you must meet the minimum criteria. 

* If you need to set up {kib}, use https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup?baymax=docs-body&elektra=docs[our free trial].

* Make sure you have {ref}/getting-started-index.html[data indexed into {es}] and an <<index-patterns,index pattern>>.

* Have an understanding of {ref}/documents-indices.html[{es} documents and indices].

* When the read-only indicator appears, you have insufficient privileges
to create or save dashboards. The options to create and save dashboards are not visible. For more information,
refer to <<xpack-security-authorization,Granting access to {kib}>>.
