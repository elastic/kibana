The best way to understand your data is to visualize it. With dashboards, you can turn your data from one or more <<data-views, data views>> into a collection of visualizations that help you monitor your data, identify important events, and gather insights. You can display your data in charts, tables, maps, and more, allowing you to compare your data side-by-side, from different points of view.

== Identify your audience

To help you choose the visualizations to display on the dashboard, identify your users and the goals they need to accomplish while using the dashboard.

[[dashboard-define-the-organization-and-hierarchy]]
=== Create visual organization and hierarchy

Display the most relevant and critical visualizations at the top of the dashboard. The first visualizations that appear on the dashboard should help users complete their most important tasks quickly and efficiently. If you require additional visualizations that appear only when users scroll down the dashboard, make sure the visualizations decrease in importance. 

You can also promote the importantance of visualizations by increasing the size. Larger visualizations become a primary focal point, while smaller visualizations appear less critical. Important visualizations can include current status, critical information, and warnings that require immediate attention. 

You can also display visualizations with summary data at the top of the dashboard, then increase the level of detail as users scroll the dashboard. Avoid using too many visualizations. Dashboards that contain too many visualizations negatively impact performance. When your dashboards require additional visualizations, consider drilldowns, which allow you to link multiple dashboards that increase in complexity. 

Group visualizations that contain related data together and in rows. For example, you have metric visualizations that display inbound and outbound traffic. To display a more detailed visualization of the data, add a bar chart that displays the inbound and outbound traffic over time.

=== Respect the aspect ratio

Horizontal proportions best show trends and small variations. 

When you display visualizations in narrow or short proportions, it is difficult to understand the data that is displayed.

== Improve dashboard loading time

To improve the dashboard loading time, enable *Defer loading panels below the fold* *Lab*, which loads dashboard panels as they become visible on the dashboard.

. In the toolbar, click *Labs*.
+
To enable *Labs*, contact your administrator, or configure the <<presentation-labs,Advanced Settings>>. 

. To specify how you want to enable the lab, use the following actions:

* *{kib}* &mdash; Enables the lab in {kib}.

* *Browser* &mdash; Enables the lab for your browser, and persists after you close the browser.

* *Session* &mdash; Enables the lab for this browser session, then resets after you close the browser.

. Click *Close*.
