The best way to understand your data is to visualize it. With dashboards, you can turn your data from one or more <<data-views, data views>> into a collection of visualizations 
that bring clarity to your data, tell a story about your data, and allow you to focus on only the data that's important to you. You can display your data in charts, tables, maps, and more, allowing you to compare your data side-by-side, identify patterns, and make connections.
