A _dashboard_ is a collection of panels that you use to analyze your data. On a dashboard, you can add a variety of panels that
you can rearrange and tell a story about your data. Panels contain everything you need, including visualizations,
interactive controls, markdown, and more.

With *Dashboard*s, you can:

* Add multiple panels to see many aspects and views of your data in one place.

* Arrange panels for analysis and comparison.

* Add text and images to provide context to the panels and make them easy to consume.

* Create and apply filters to focus on the data you want to display.

* Control who can use your data, and share the dashboard with a small or large audience.

* Generate reports based on your findings.

To begin, open the menu, go to *Dashboard*, then click *Create dashboard*.

Panels contain everything you need to tell a story about you data, including visualizations,
interactive controls, Markdown, and more.

[cols="50, 50"]
|===

a| *Area*

Displays data points, connected by a line, where the area between the line and axes are shaded.
Use area charts to compare two or more categories over time, and display the magnitude of trends.

| image:images/area.png[Area chart]

a| *Stacked area*

Displays the evolution of the value of several data groups. The values of each group are displayed
on top of each other. Use stacked area charts to visualize part-to-whole relationships, and to show
how each category contributes to the cumulative total.

| image:images/stacked_area.png[Stacked area chart]

a| *Bar*

Displays bars side-by-side where each bar represents a category. Use bar charts to compare data across a
large number of categories, display data that includes categories with negative values, and easily identify
the categories that represent the highest and lowest values. Kibana also supports horizontal bar charts.

| image:images/bar.png[Bar chart]

a| *Stacked bar*

Displays numeric values across two or more categories. Use stacked bar charts to compare numeric values between
levels of a categorical value. Kibana also supports stacked horizontal bar charts.

| image:images/stacked_bar.png[Stacked area chart]


a| *Line*

Displays data points that are connected by a line. Use line charts to visualize a sequence of values, discover
trends over time, and forecast future values.

| image:images/line.png[Line chart]

a| *Pie*

Displays slices that represent a data category, where the slice size is proportional to the quantity it represents.
Use pie charts to show comparisons between multiple categories, illustrate the dominance of one category over others,
and show percentage or proportional data.

| image:images/pie.png[Pie chart]

a| *Donut*

Similar to the pie chart, but the central circle is removed. Use donut charts when you’d like to display multiple statistics at once.

| image:images/donut.png[Donut chart]


a| *Tree map*

Relates different segments of your data to the whole. Each rectangle is subdivided into smaller rectangles, or sub branches, based on
its proportion to the whole. Use treemaps to make efficient use of space to show percent total for each category.

| image:images/treemap.png[Tree map]


a| *Heat map*

Displays graphical representations of data where the individual values are represented by colors. Use heat maps when your data set includes
categorical data. For example, use a heat map to see the flights of origin countries compared to destination countries using the sample flight data.

| image:images/heat_map.png[Heat map]

a| *Goal*

Displays how your metric progresses toward a fixed goal. Use the goal to display an easy to read visual of the status of your goal progression.

| image:images/goal.png[Goal]


a| *Gauge*

Displays your data along a scale that changes color according to where your data falls on the expected scale. Use the gauge to show how metric
values relate to reference threshold values, or determine how a specified field is performing versus how it is expected to perform.

| image:images/gauge.png[Gauge]


a| *Metric*

Displays a single numeric value for an aggregation. Use the metric visualization when you have a numeric value that is powerful enough to tell
a story about your data.

| image:images/metric.png[Metric]


a| *Data table*

Displays your raw data or aggregation results in a tabular format. Use data tables to display server configuration details, track counts, min,
or max values for a specific field, and monitor the status of key services.

| image:images/data_table.png[Data table]


a| *Tag cloud*

Graphical representations of how frequently a word appears in the source text. Use tag clouds to easily produce a summary of large documents and
create visual art for a specific topic.

| image:images/tag_cloud.png[Tag cloud]


a| *Maps*

For all your mapping needs, use <<maps,Maps>>.

[[create-panels]]
== Create panels

To create a panel, make sure you have {ref}/getting-started-index.html[data indexed into {es}] and an <<index-patterns,index pattern>>
to retrieve the data from {es}. If you aren’t ready to use your own data, {kib} comes with several pre-built dashboards that you can test out. For more information,
refer to <<add-sample-data, Explore {kib} using sample data>>.

To begin, click *Create new*, then choose one of the following options on the
*New Visualization* window:

* Click on the type of panel you want to create, then configure the options.

* Select an editor to help you create the panel.

[role="screenshot"]

{kib} provides you with several editors that help you create panels.

[float]
[[lens]]
=== Create panels with Lens

*Lens* is the simplest and fastest way to create powerful visualizations of your data. To use *Lens*, you drag and drop as many data fields
as you want onto the visualization builder pane, and *Lens* uses heuristics to decide how to apply each field to the visualization.

With *Lens*, you can:

* Use the automatically generated suggestions to change the visualization type.
* Create visualizations with multiple layers and indices.
* Change the aggregation and labels to customize the data.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_drag_drop.gif[Drag and drop]

TIP: Drag-and-drop capabilities are available only when *Lens* knows how to use the data. If *Lens* is unable to automatically generate a
visualization, configure the customization options for your visualization.

[float]
[[fiter-the-data-fields]]
==== Filter the data fields

The data fields that are displayed are based on the selected <<index-patterns,index pattern>> and the <<set-time-filter,time filter>>.

Click *Panel options*, then enter the syntax in the *Panel Filter* field.

If you want to ignore filters from all of {kib}, select *Yes* for *Ignore global filter*.

[float]
[[vega]]
=== Create custom panels with Vega

Build custom visualizations using *Vega* and *Vega-Lite*, backed by one or more data sources including {es}, Elastic Map Service,
URL, or static data. Use the {kib} extensions to embed *Vega* in your dashboard, and add interactive tools.

Use *Vega* and *Vega-Lite* when you want to create a visualization for:

* Aggregations that use `nested` or `parent/child` mapping
* Aggregations without an index pattern
* Queries that use custom time filters
* Complex calculations
* Extracting data from _source instead of aggregations
* Scatter charts, sankey charts, and custom maps
* Using an unsupported visual theme

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/vega.png[Vega UI]

*Vega* and *Vega-Lite*  are declarative formats that:

* Create complex visualizations
* Use JSON and a different syntax for declaring visualizations
* Are not fully interchangeable

For more information about *Vega* and *Vega-Lite*, refer to:

* <<vega-lite-tutorial-create-your-first-visualizations,Create your first visualization>>
