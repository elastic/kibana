**_Visualize your data with dashboards._**

The best way to understand your data is to visualize it. With dashboards, you can turn your data from one or more <<index-patterns, index patterns>> into a collection of panels 
that bring clarity to your data, tell a story about your data, and allow you to focus on only the data that's important to you. Configure each panel to display your data in a chart, table, map, and more, 
then compare the panels side-by-side to identify the patterns and connections in your data.

Dashboards support many types of panels, and provide several editors that you can use to create panels.

[cols="2"]
|===

| <<create-panels-with-lens,Lens>>
| The drag and drop editor that creates visualizations of your data. *Lens* is recommended for most users.

| <<maps,Maps>>
| Create beautiful displays of your geographical data.

| <<add-panels-with-advanced-editors,Advanced editors>>
| Visualize time series data with *TSVB* or *Timelion*, or create a custom visualization using *Vega* or *Vega-Lite*.

| <<add-aggregation-based-visualization-panels,Aggregation-based visualization panels>>
| Build most visualization types using {es} <<aggregation-reference,aggregations>>. 

| <<enhance-dashboards,Tools>>
| Add context to your panels with <<add-text,text>>, or add dynamic filters with <<add-controls,*Controls*>>.

| <<save-your-search,Saved search table>>
| Display a previously saved search table from <<discover, *Discover*>>. The table results are not aggregated.

| <<xpack-ml-anomalies,Machine Learning>>
| Display a previously saved visualization of <<xpack-ml, machine learning>> anomaly detection data.

[[search-or-filter-your-data]]
=== Search or filter your data

{kib} provides you with several ways to search your data and apply {es} filters. You can combine the filters with any panel-specific
filters to display the data want to you see.

[role="screenshot"]
image::dashboard/images/dashboard-filters.png[Labeled interface with semi-structured search, time filter, and additional filters]

Semi-structured search::
  Combine free text search with field-based search using the <<kuery-query,{kib} Query Language>>.
  Type a search term to match across all fields, or begin typing a field name to
  get prompted with field names and operators you can use to build a structured query.
  +
  For example, in the sample web logs data, this query displays data only for the US:

  . Enter `g`, and then select *geo.source*.
  . Select *equals some value* and *US*, and then click *Update*.
  . For a more complex search, try:

    `geo.src : "US" and url.keyword : "https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat"`

Time filter::
  Dashboards have a global time filter that restricts the data that displays, but individual panels can
  override the global time filter.
  
  . To update the time filter, add a panel that displays time on the x-axis.

  . Open the panel menu, then select *More > Customize time range*.

  . On the *Customize panel time range* window, specify the new time range, then click *Add to panel*.

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/time_range_per_panel.gif[Time range per dashboard panel]

Additional filters with AND::
  You can add filters to a dashboard, or pin filters to multiple places in {kib}. To add filters, using a basic editor or an advanced JSON editor for the {es} {ref}/query-dsl.html[query DSL].
  
  When you use more than one index pattern on a dashboard, the filter editor allows you to filter only one dashboard.
  
  To dynamically add filters, click a series on a dashboard. For example, to filter the dashboard to display only ios data:

  . Click *Add filter*.
  . Set *Field* to *machine.os*, *Operator* to *is*, and *Value* to *ios*.
  . *Save* the filter.
  . To remove the filter, click *x* next to the filter.

[[clone-panels]]
=== Clone panels

To duplicate a panel and the configured functionality, clone the panel. Cloned panels continue to replicate all of the functionality from the original panel, 
including renaming, editing, and cloning. When you clone a panel, the clone appears beside the original panel, and moves other panels to provide a space on the 
dashboard.

. From the toolbar, click *Edit*. 

. Open the panel menu, then select *Clone panel*. 
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/clone_panel.gif[clone panel]

{kib} automatically saves the cloned panel in *Visualize*. To access the cloned panel, open the main menu, then click *Visualize*.

[float]
[[explore-the-underlying-data]]
=== Explore the underlying documents

Dashboard panels have a shortcut to view the underlying documents in *Discover*. Open the panel menu,
then click *Explore underlying data*. *Discover* will be opened with the same time range and filters as the panel.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/explore_data_context_menu.png[Explore underlying data from panel context menu]

A second shortcut is disabled by default, and creates a new interaction when clicking on a chart.
This shortcut is similar to a <<drilldowns, drilldown>>, but can show you data for only one series.
To enable the chart interactivity shortcut, add the following to kibana.yml:

["source","yml"]
-----------
xpack.discoverEnhanced.actions.exploreDataInChart.enabled: true
-----------

[role="screenshot"]

TIP: *Explore underlying data* is available only for visualization panels with a single index pattern.

[float]
[[download-csv]]
=== Download panel data as CSV

Download panel data in a CSV file. You can download most panels in a CSV file, but there is a shortcut available
for *Lens* panels.

[role="xpack"]
Lens::
Open the *Lens* panel menu, then select *More > Download as CSV*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/download_csv_context_menu.png[Download as CSV from panel context menu]
