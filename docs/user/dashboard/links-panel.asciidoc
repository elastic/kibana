=== Link panels

You can use *Links* panels to create links to other dashboards or external websites. When creating links to other dashboards, you have the option to carry the time range and query and filters to apply to the linked dashboard. Links to external websites follow the <<external-URL-policy,`externalUrl.policy`>> settings. *Links* panels support vertical and horizontal layouts and may be saved to the *Library* for use on other dashboards.
