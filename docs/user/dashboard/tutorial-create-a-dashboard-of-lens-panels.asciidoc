== Create your first dashboard

Learn the most common ways to create a dashboard from your own data.
The tutorial will use sample data from the perspective of an analyst looking
at website logs, but this type of dashboard works on any type of data.

When you're done, you'll have a complete overview of the sample web logs data.

To create the visualizations in this tutorial, you'll use the following fields:

* *Records*

* *timestamp*

* *bytes*

* *clientip*

* *referer.keyword*

To see the most frequent values in a field, hover over the field name, then click *i*.

[discrete]
[[view-the-number-of-website-visitors]]
=== Create your first visualization

Pick a field you want to analyze, such as *clientip*. To analyze only the *clientip* field, use the *Metric* visualization to display the field as a number.

The only number function that you can use with *clientip* is *Unique count*, also referred to as cardinality, which approximates the number of unique values.

. Open the *Visualization type* dropdown, then select *Metric*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_visualizationTypeDropdown_8.0.png[Visualization type dropdown]

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *clientip* to the workspace or layer pane.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_metricUniqueCountOfClientip_7.16.png[Metric visualization of the clientip field]
+
In the layer pane, *Unique count of clientip* appears because the editor automatically applies the *Unique count* function to the *clientip* field. *Unique count* is the only numeric function that works with IP addresses.

. In the layer pane, click *Unique count of clientip*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Unique visitors`.

.. Click *Close*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_metricUniqueVisitors_7.16.png[Metric visualization that displays number of unique visitors]

. Click *Save and return*.
+
*[No Title]* appears in the visualization panel header. Since the visualization has its own `Unique visitors` label, you do not need to add a panel title.

[[mixed-multiaxis]]
=== View a metric over time

There are two shortcuts you can use to view metrics over time. 
When you drag a numeric field to the workspace, the visualization editor adds the default
time field from the {data-source}. When you use the *Date histogram* function, you can
replace the time field by dragging the field to the workspace.

To visualize the *bytes* field over time:

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*. 

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *bytes* to the workspace. 
+
The visualization editor creates a bar chart with the *timestamp* and *Median of bytes* fields. 

. To zoom in on the data, click and drag your cursor across the bars. 
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_3_1_1.gif[Zoom in on the data]

To emphasize the change in *Median of bytes* over time, change the visualization type to *Line* with one of the following options:

* In the *Suggestions*, click the line chart.
* In the editor toolbar, open the *Visualization type* dropdown, then select *Line*.
* In the layer pane, open the *Layer visualization type* menu, then click *Line*.

To increase the minimum time interval:

. In the layer pane, click *timestamp*.

. Select *Customize time interval*.

. Change the *Minimum interval* to *1 days*, then click *Close*.
+
You can increase and decrease the minimum interval, but you are unable to decrease the interval below the <<advanced-options,*Advanced Settings*>>. 

To save space on the dashboard, hide the axis labels.

. Open the *Left axis* menu, then deselect *Show*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_leftAxisMenu_7.16.png[Left axis menu]

. Open the *Bottom axis* menu, then deselect *Show*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_lineChartMetricOverTime_7.16.png[Line chart that displays metric data over time]

. Click *Save and return*

Since you removed the axis labels, add a panel title:

. Open the panel menu, then select *Edit panel title*.

. In the *Panel title* field, enter `Median of bytes`, then click *Save*.

[[view-the-distribution-of-visitors-by-operating-system]]
=== View the top values of a field

Create a visualization that displays the most frequent values of *request.keyword* on your website, ranked by the unique visitors.
To create the visualization, use *Top values of request.keyword* ranked by *Unique count of clientip*, instead of being ranked by *Count of records*.

The *Top values* function ranks the unique values of a field by another function.
The values are the most frequent when ranked by a *Count* function, and the largest when ranked by the *Sum* function.

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*. 

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *clientip* to the *Vertical axis* field in the layer pane. 
+
The visualization editor automatically applies the *Unique count* function. If you drag *clientip* to the workspace, the editor adds the field to the incorrect axis.

. Drag *request.keyword* to the workspace.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_2_1_1.png[Vertical bar chart with top values of request.keyword by most unique visitors]
+
When you drag a text or IP address field to the workspace,
the editor adds the *Top values* function ranked by *Count of records* to show the most frequent values.

The chart labels are unable to display because the *request.keyword* field contains long text fields. You could use one of the *Suggestions*, but the suggestions also have issues with long text. The best way to display long text fields is with the *Table* visualization.

. Open the *Visualization type* dropdown, then select *Table*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_2_1_2.png[Table with top values of request.keyword by most unique visitors]

. In the layer pane, click *Top values of request.keyword*.

.. In the *Number of values* field, enter `10`.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Page URL`.

.. Click *Close*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_tableTopFieldValues_7.16.png[Table that displays the top field values]

. Click *Save and return*.
+
Since the table columns are labeled, you do not need to add a panel title.

[[custom-ranges]]
=== Compare a subset of documents to all documents

Create a proportional visualization that helps you determine if your users transfer more bytes from documents under 10KB versus documents over 10Kb.

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*. 

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *bytes* to the *Vertical axis* field in the layer pane.

. Click *Median of bytes*, click the *Sum* function, then click *Close*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *bytes* to the *Break down by* field in the layer pane.

To select documents based on the number range of a field, use the *Intervals* function.
When the ranges are non numeric, or the query requires multiple clauses, you could use the *Filters* function.

Specify the file size ranges: 

. In the layer pane, click *bytes*.

. Click *Create custom ranges*, enter the following in the *Ranges* field, then press Return:

* *Ranges* &mdash; `0` -> `10240`

* *Label* &mdash; `Below 10KB`

. Click *Add range*, enter the following, then press Return:

*Table* and *Proportion* visualizations support multiple functions. For example, to create visualizations that break down the data by website traffic sources and user geography, apply the *Filters* and *Top values* functions.

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*. 

. Open the *Visualization type* dropdown, then select *Treemap*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *Records* to the *Size by* field in the layer pane. 

. In the editor, click *Add or drag-and-drop a field* for *Group by*.

Create a filter for each website traffic source:

. From *Select a function*, click *Filters*.

. Click *All records*, enter the following in the query bar, then press Return:

* *KQL* &mdash; `referer : *facebook.com*`

* *Label* &mdash; `Facebook`

. Click *Add a filter*, enter the following in the query bar, then press Return:

* *KQL* &mdash; `referer : *twitter.com*`

* *Label* &mdash; `Twitter`

. Click *Add a filter*, enter the following in the query bar, then press Return:

* *KQL* &mdash; `NOT referer : *twitter.com* OR NOT referer: *facebook.com*`

* *Label* &mdash; `Other`

. Click *Close*.

Add the user geography grouping:

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *geo.srcdest* to the workspace.

. To change the *Group by* order, drag *Top values of geo.srcdest* in the layer pane so that appears first.
