== Build your first dashboard

Learn the most common ways to build a dashboard from your own data.
The tutorial will use sample data from the perspective of an analyst looking
at website logs, but this type of dashboard works on any type of data.
Before using this tutorial, you should be familiar with the <<kibana-concepts-analysts>>.

[[add-the-data-and-create-the-dashboard]]
=== Add the data and create the dashboard

Install the sample web logs data that you'll use to create your dashboard.

. On the {kib} *Home* page, click *Try our sample data*.

. From *Sample web logs*, click *Add data*.

Then create a new dashboard:

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard*.

. Click *Create dashboard*.

. Set the <<set-time-filter,time filter>> to *Last 90 days*.

[[open-and-set-up-lens]]
=== Open Lens and get familiar with the data

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. Make sure the *kibana_sample_data_logs* index appears. You might need to select
a different index pattern from the dropdown:

This tutorial uses `Records`, timestamp`, `bytes`, `clientip`, and `referer.keyword`.
To see the most frequent values of a field, click the field name to view a summary.

The main elements of *Lens* are named:

Workspace panel:: Displays your visualization. You can drag and drop onto this area.
Dimensions:: Each dimension is a function with extra options. Dimensions are grouped
for each visualization type, for example the *Vertical axis* is a group that allows
multiple dimensions. Each dimension starts empty with the label *Drop a field or click to add*.
Functions:: There are two main types of functions: *buckets* and *metrics*, which are
equivalent to what {es} provides.

=== Create your first visualization

Every time you build a visualization in *Lens*, you will follow these steps:

* *Choose your visualization.* Do you know the type of visualization you'd like to use?
If you do, select the type before dragging any fields. If you don't, you can change the
visualization type after configuring your functions.

* *Choose your field.* Do you know the dimension group you want to use the field in? If you do,
drag and drop the field from the field list to your chosen dimension and Lens will pick a function for you.
If you don't, drag and drop the field onto the workspace panel. Skip this step if you are
using the *Filters* function.

* *Edit and delete.* To change the function or styling options, click the dimension to open
the configuration panel. To delete a specific dimension, close the configuration panel and click
the delete button. To reset the entire visualization, click *Reset layer*.

To put this into practice, pick a field you want to analyze, such as `clientip`. If you want
to analyze only this field, you can use *Metric* to show a big number.
The only number function that you can use with `clientip` is *Unique count*.
*Unique count*, also known as cardinality, approximates the number of unique values
of the `clientip` field.

. To select the visualization type, click *Bar vertical stacked* to open the chart type dropdown, then select *Metric*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_1_2_1.png[Chart Type dropdown with Metric selected]

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop `clientip` to the workspace panel.
Lens selects *Unique count* because it is the only numeric function
that works for IP addresses. You can also drag and drop `clientip` onto
the empty dimension for the same result.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_1_3.png[Changed type and dropped clientip field]

. In the editor, click *Unique count of clientip*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Unique visitors`.

.. Click *Close*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_1_4.png[Flyout config open]

. Click *Save and return*.

. Customize the newly added panel:

.. Drag the bottom corner of the panel until the metric takes up one quarter of the screen
width. The row for the metric will have 4 items on it later.

.. The metric visualization has its own label, so you do not need to add a panel title.

. Click *Save* on the dashboard menu

. In the *Title* field, enter `Logs dashboard`.

. Select *Store time with dashboard* box, then click *Save*.

. After the dashboard refreshes, click *Edit* again.

=== View a metric over time

*Lens* has two shortcuts that simplify viewing metrics over time. 
If you drag and drop a numeric field to the workspace panel, *Lens* adds the default
time field from the index pattern. If the *Date histogram* function is being used,
quickly replace the time field by dragging and dropping on the workspace panel.

To visualize the `bytes` field over time without choosing a visualization type or function:

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop `bytes` onto the workspace panel to have *Lens* automatically
create a chart. It will create a bar chart with two dimensions, *timestamp* and *Median of bytes*.

. *Lens* automatically chooses a date interval. To zoom in on the data you want to view,
click and drag your cursor across the bars. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_3_1_1.gif[Zoom in on the data]

To emphasize the change in *Median of bytes* over time, use a line chart.
To change the visualization type, use one of the following ways:

* From the *Suggestions*, click the line chart.
* Click *Bar vertical stacked*, then select *Line*.
* Click the chart type icon above *Horizontal axis*, then click the line icon.

Most users use the automatic time interval. You can increase and decrease
the minimum interval that *Lens* will use, but you cannot decrease the interval
below the {kib} advanced settings.  To set the minimum time interval:

. In the editor, click *timestamp*.

. Click *How it works* to learn about the *Lens* minimum interval

. Select *Customize time interval*.

. Increase the *Minimum interval* to `1 days`, then click *Close*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_3_1.png[Customize time interval]

To save space on the dashboard, so to save space, hide the vertical and horizontal
axis labels.

. Open the *Left axis* menu, then deselect *Show*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_4_3.png[Turn off axis name]

. Open the *Bottom axis* menu, then deselect *Show*.

. Click *Save and return*

. On the dashboard, move the panel so that it is in the same row as the *Metric* visualization panel. The two should
take up half the screen width.

. Add a panel title to explain the panel, which is necessary because you removed the axis labels.

.. Open the panel menu and choose *Edit panel title*.

.. In the *Title* field, enter `Median of bytes`, then click *Save*.

. In the toolbar, click *Save*.

=== View the top values of a field

The *Top values* function ranks the unique values of a field by another dimension.
The values are the most frequent when ranked by a *Count* dimension.
The values are the largest when ranked by a *Sum* dimension.

When you drag and drop a text or IP address field onto the workspace panel,
*Lens* adds a *Top values* function ranked by *Count of records* to show the most frequent values.

For this tutorial, you have picked a field and function, but not a visualization type.
You want to see the most frequent values of `request.keyword` on your website, ranked by the unique visitors.
This means that you want to use *Top values of request.keyword* ranked by *Unique count of clientip*, instead of
being ranked by *Count of records*.

. Starting with the default bar chart, drag the `clientip` field onto the *Vertical axis*.
This will produce the `Unique count of clientip` metric. Do not drop the field into the main workspace,
because the *Top values* function will be used instead.

. Drag and drop `request.keyword` to the main workspace, and *Lens* will add `Top values of request.keyword`
to the *Horizontal axis*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_2_1_1.png[Vertical bar chart with top values of request.keyword by most unique visitors]

This chart is hard to read because the `request.keyword` field contains long text. You could try
using one of the *Suggestions*, but the suggestions also have issues with long text. Instead, switch
to a *Table* visualization:

. Click *Bar vertical stacked* to open the chart switcher

. Click *Table*
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_2_1_2.png[Table with top values of request.keyword by most unique visitors]

Customize the table even more:

. Click *Top values of request.keyword*

.. Increase the *Number of values*. The maximum allowed value is 1000.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Page URL`.

. Click *Close*.

. Click *Save and return*.

. Arrange the table panel so that it has its own row, but keep the default width of half the screen.

. You do not need a panel title because the table columns are clearly labeled.

[[custom-ranges]]
=== Compare the percentage of a subset to the whole

To compare a subset to the whole you need to create non-overlapping sets of documents that add up to 100%.
For numeric data the *intervals* function is the best option, while for all other data types *filters* is
recommended. Use a proportion chart to display the values as a percentage of the sum. Lens has 5 types of proportion charts:
pie, donut, treemap, percentage bar and percentage area.

To determine if your users transfer more small files versus large files, create two non-overlapping intervals. Start
with a bar chart and then switch to a pie chart to display as percentage:

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop `bytes` to *Vertical axis* in the editor.

. Click *Median of bytes* and then select *Sum* instead. Then *Close*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop `bytes` to *Break down by* in the editor, then specify the file size ranges.

.. Click `bytes`.

[discrete]
[[histogram]]
=== View the numeric distribution in a histogram

Use the *intervals* function in *Lens* to see an evenly spaced numeric distribution.
For logs data, this might be used to find the best time to shut down your website for maintenance.
To create a numeric histogram showing total traffic per hour:

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop `bytes` to *Vertical axis* in the editor.

. Click *Median of bytes* and choose the *Sum* function instead.

. In the *Display name* field, enter `Transferred bytes`.

. From the *Value format* dropdown, select `Bytes (1024)`, then click *Close*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *hour_of_day* to *Horizontal axis* in the editor.

. Click *hour_of_day*, and then slide the *Intervals granularity* slider until the horizontal axis displays hourly intervals.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_5_2.png[Create custom ranges]

. Click *Save and return*.

. Shrink the panel size, then drag it to the first row next to the *Median of bytes* panel. There
should be four panels in a row.

. You do not need a panel title because the axis labels are self-explanatory.

[discrete]
[[treemap]]
=== Create a multi-level chart

*Lens* lets you use multiple functions in the data table and proportion charts. For example,
to create a chart which breaks down the traffic sources and user geography, use the *filters*
function and *top values* function:

. Click *Bar vertical stacked*, then select *Treemap*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *Records* to the *Size by* field in the editor. 

. In the editor, click the *Drop a field or click to add* field for *Group by*, then create a filter for each website traffic source.

.. From *Select a function*, click *Filters*.

.. Click *All records*, enter the following, then press Return:

* *KQL* &mdash; `referer : *facebook.com*`

* *Label* &mdash; `Facebook`

.. Click *Add a filter*, enter the following, then press Return:

* *KQL* &mdash; `referer : *twitter.com*`

* *Label* &mdash; `Twitter`

.. Click *Add a filter*, enter the following, then press Return:

* *KQL* &mdash; `NOT referer : *twitter.com* OR NOT referer: *facebook.com*`

* *Label* &mdash; `Other`

.. Click *Close*.

Then add the next break down by geography:

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *geo.src* to the main workspace.

. To change the *Group by* order, click and drag *Top values of geo.src* so that it appears first in the editor.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_7_2.png[Treemap vis]

. To view only the Facebook and Twitter data, remove the *Other* category. 

.. In the editor, click *Top values of geo.src*.

.. From the *Advanced* dropdown, deselect *Group other values as "Other"*, then click *Close*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_7_3.png[Group other values as Other]

. Click *Save and return*.

. Arrange the panel so that it is in the same row as the table.

.. Click the gear icon and choose *Edit panel title*.

.. Enter "Page views by location and referer" as the panel title, then click *Save*.

[discrete]
=== Save the dashboard

Now that you have a complete overview of your web server data, save the dashboard.

. In the toolbar, click *Save*.

. On the *Save dashboard* window, enter `Web server data`, then click *Save*.

. If this was not the first time you saved the dashboard, click *Switch to view mode*
