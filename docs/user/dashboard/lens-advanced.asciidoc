== Tutorial: Time series analysis with Lens

You collected sales data from your store, and you want to visualize and analyze the data on a dashboard. 
To create dashboard panels of the data, open the *Lens* visualization builder, then  
create the visualization panels that best display the data.

When you've completed the tutorial, you'll have a dashboard that provides you with a complete overview of your ecommerce sales data.

==== Add a second chart type or index pattern to your existing chart

You can add multiple metrics to a single chart type, but if you want to overlay
multiple chart types or index patterns, use *layers*. When building layered charts
it is important to match the data on the horizontal axis so that it uses the same
scale. To add a line chart layer on top of your area chart:

. In the editor, click *+*.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_3_2.png[Add new layer button]

. From the new layer editor, click the *Chart type* dropdown, then click the line chart.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_3_3.png[Change layer type]
+
The chart type for the visualization changes to *Mixed XY*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop the data fields to the *Drop a field or click to add* fields in the editor.

.. Drag and drop *timestamp* to the *Horizontal axis* field.

.. Drag and drop *clientip* to the *Vertical axis* field.

. Change the *timestamp* interval to match the layers.

.. Click *timestamp* in the line chart layer.

.. Select *Customize time interval*.

.. Change the *Minimum interval* to `1 days`, then click *Close*.

. In the editor, click *Unique count of clientip*. In the *Display name* field, enter `Unique visitors`.

The new metric is automatically assigned a color. To choose a specific metric color:

. In the *Series color* field, enter *#CA8EAE*, then click *Close*.

There is a significant difference between the *timestamp per day* and *Unique visitors* data, which makes the *Unique visitors* data difficult to read. To improve the readability, 
display the *Unique visitors* data along a second y-axis, then change the formatting. When functions contain multiple formats, separate axes are created by default. 

. In the editor, click *Unique visitors* in the line chart layer.

. For *Axis side*, click *Right*, then click *Close*.
