[[add-the-data-and-create-the-dashboard-advanced]]
=== Add the data and create the dashboard

Add the sample ecommerce data, and create and set up the dashboard.

. Go to the *Home* page, then click *Try sample data*.

. On the *Sample eCommerce orders* card, click *Add data*.

Create the dashboard where you'll display the visualization panels.

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard*.

. On the *Dashboards* page, click *Create dashboard*.

[[open-and-set-up-lens-advanced]]
=== Open and set up the visualization editor

Open the visualization editor, then make sure the correct fields appear.

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. Make sure the *kibana_sample_data_ecommerce* {data-source} appears, then set the <<set-time-filter,time filter>> to *Last 30 days*.

[[custom-time-interval]]
=== Create visualizations with custom time intervals

When you create visualizations with time series data, you can use the default time interval, or increase and decrease the interval. For performance reasons, the visualization editor allows you to choose the minimum time interval, but not the exact time interval. The interval limit is controlled by the <<histogram-maxbars, `histogram:maxBars`>> setting and <<set-time-filter,time range>>. 

To analyze the data with a custom time interval, create a bar chart that shows you how many orders were made at your store every hour:

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *Records* to the workspace.
+
The visualization editor creates a bar chart.

. To zoom in on the data, click and drag your cursor across the bars. 
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_clickAndDragZoom_7.16.gif[Cursor clicking and dragging across the bars to zoom in on the data]

. In the layer pane, click *Count of Records*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Number of orders`.

.. Click *Add advanced options > Normalize by unit*. 

.. From the *Normalize by unit* dropdown, select *per hour*, then click *Close*.
+
*Normalize unit* converts *Average sales per 12 hours* into *Average sales per 12 hours (per hour)* by dividing the number of hours.

. To hide the *Horizontal axis* label, open the *Bottom Axis* menu, then deselect *Show*.

To identify the 75th percentile of orders, add a reference line:

. In the layer pane, click *Add layer > Reference lines*.

. Click *Static value*.

. Click the *Percentile* function, then enter `75` in the *Percentile* field. 

. Configure the display options.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `75th`.

.. Select *Show display name*.

.. From the *Icon* dropdown, select *Tag*.

.. In the *Color* field, enter `#E7664C`.

. Click *Close*.

[[add-a-data-layer-advanced]]
=== Analyze multiple data series

You can create visualizations with multiple data series within the same time interval, even when the series have similar configurations with minor differences.

To analyze multiple series, create a line chart that displays the price distribution of products sold over time:

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. Open the *Visualization type* dropdown, then select *Line*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *products.price* to the workspace.

Create the 95th price distribution percentile:

. In the layer pane, click *Median of products.price*.

. Click the *Percentile* function.

. In the *Display name* field, enter `95th`, then click *Close*.

To copy a function, you drag it to the *Drop a field or click to add* field within the same group. To create the 90th percentile, duplicate the `95th` percentile:

. Drag the *95th* field to *Add or drag-and-drop a field* for *Vertical axis*.

[[add-a-data-layer]]
=== Analyze multiple visualization types

With layers, you can analyze your data with multiple visualization types. When you create layered visualizations, match the data on the horizontal axis so that it uses the same scale. 

To analyze multiple visualization types, create an area chart that displays the average order prices, then add a line chart layer that displays the number of customers. 

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *products.price* to the workspace.

. In the layer pane, click *Median of products.price*.

.. Click the *Average* function.

[[percentage-stacked-area]]
=== Compare the change in percentage over time

By default, the visualization editor displays time series data with stacked charts, which show how the different document sets change over time. 

To view change over time as a percentage, create an *Area percentage* chart that displays three order categories over time:

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *Records* to the workspace.

. Open the *Visualization type* dropdown, then select *Area percentage*.

For each order category, create a filter: 

. In the layer pane, click *Add or drag-and-drop a field* for *Break down by*.

. Click the *Filters* function.

. Click *All records*, enter the following in the query bar, then press Return:

* *KQL* &mdash; `category.keyword : *Clothing`

* *Label* &mdash; `Clothing`

. Click *Add a filter*, enter the following in the query bar, then press Return:

* *KQL* &mdash; `category.keyword : *Shoes`

* *Label* &mdash; `Shoes`

. Click *Add a filter*, enter the following in the query bar, then press Return:

* *KQL* &mdash; `category.keyword : *Accessories`

* *Label* &mdash; `Accessories`

. Click *Close*.

. Open the *Legend* menu, then select the *Alignment* arrow that points up.

[[view-the-cumulative-number-of-products-sold-on-weekends]]
=== View the cumulative number of products sold on weekends

To determine the number of orders made only on Saturday and Sunday, create an area chart, then add it to the dashboard.

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. Open the *Visualization type* dropdown, then select *Area*.

Configure the cumulative sum of store orders:

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *Records* to the workspace.

. In the layer pane, click *Count of Records*.

. Click the *Cumulative sum* function.

. In the *Display name* field, enter `Cumulative weekend orders`, then click *Close*.

Filter the results to display the data for only Saturday and Sunday:

. In the layer pane, click *Add or drag-and-drop a field* for *Break down by*. 

. Click the *Filters* function.

. Click *All records*, enter the following in the query bar, then press Return:

* *KQL* &mdash; `day_of_week : "Saturday" or day_of_week : "Sunday"`

* *Label* &mdash; `Saturday and Sunday`
+
The <<kuery-query,KQL filter>> displays all documents where `day_of_week` matches `Saturday` or `Sunday`.

. Open the *Legend* menu, then click *Hide*.

[[compare-time-ranges]]
=== Compare time ranges

With *Time shift*, you can compare the data from different time ranges. To make sure the data correctly displays, choose a multiple of the date histogram interval when you use multiple time shifts. For example, you are unable to use a *36h* time shift for one series, and a *1d* time shift for the second series if the interval is *days*.   

To compare two time ranges, create a line chart that compares the sales in the current week with sales from the previous week: 

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. Open the *Visualization type* dropdown, then select *Line*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *Records* to the workspace.

. To duplicate *Count of Records*, drag *Count of Records* to *Add or drag-and-drop a field* for *Vertical axis* in the layer pane.

To create a week-over-week comparison, shift *Count of Records [1]* by one week:

. In the layer pane, click *Count of Records [1]*.

. Click *Add advanced options > Time shift*, select *1 week ago*, then click *Close*.
+
To use custom time shifts, enter the time value and increment, then press Enter. For example, enter *1w* to use the *1 week ago* time shift.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_time_shift.png[Line chart with week-over-week sales comparison]

. Click *Save and return*.

Time shifts can be used on any metric. The special shift *previous* will show the time window preceding the currently selected one in the time picker in the top right, spanning the same duration.
For example, if *Last 7 days* is selected in the time picker, *previous* will show data from 14 days ago to 7 days ago. This mode can't be used together with date histograms.

[float]
[[compare-time-as-percent]]
==== Analyze the percent change between time ranges

With *Formula*, you can analyze the percent change in your data from different time ranges.

To compare time range changes as a percent, create a bar chart that compares the sales in the current week with sales from the previous week: 

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *Records* to the workspace.

. In the layer pane, click *Count of Records*.

. Click *Formula*, then enter `count() / count(shift='1w') - 1`.

. Open the *Value format* dropdown, select *Percent*, then enter `0` in the *Decimals* field.

. In the *Display name* field, enter `Percent of change`, then click *Close*.

[[view-customers-over-time-by-continents]]
=== Analyze the data in a table

With tables, you can view and compare the field values, which is useful for displaying the locations of customer orders.

Create a date histogram table and group the customer count metric by category, such as the continent registered in user accounts:

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. Open the *Visualization type* dropdown, then select *Table*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *customer_id* to the *Metrics* field in the layer pane.

.. In the layer pane, click *Unique count of customer_id*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Customers`, then click *Close*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *order_date* to the *Rows* field in the layer pane.

.. In the layer pane, click the *order_date*.

.. Select *Customize time interval*.

.. Change the *Minimum interval* to *1 days*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Sales`, then click *Close*.

To split the metric, add columns for each continent using the *Columns* field:

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *geoip.continent_name* to the *Columns* field in the layer pane.
