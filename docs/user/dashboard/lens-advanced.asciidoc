== Tutorial: Create a dashboard of panels with ecommerce sales data

You collected sales data from your store, and you want to visualize and analyze the data on a dashboard. 
To create dashboard panels of the data, open the *Lens* visualization builder, then  
create the visualization panels that best display the data.

When you've completed the tutorial, you'll have a dashboard that provides you with a complete overview of your ecommerce sales data.

=== View the number of transactions per hour by normalizing by unit or selecting custom interval

To determine the number of orders made per hour, create a bar chart, then add it to the dashboard.

. Set the <<set-time-filter,time filter>> to *Last 30 days*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *Records* to the visualization builder.
+

. Change the *Vertical axis* title and display the number of orders per day. 

.. From the editor, click *Count of Records*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Number of orders`.

. To view number of transactions per hour, you can normalize the current interval by unit or customize time interval to 1 hour. *Normalize by unit* will calculate an hourly average for each 12-hour interval, which is less granular but faster than querying each hour. Customizing time interval will create a bucket for each hour, so querying will be slower. Apart from that, for a very big timerange, the created interval can be bigger than 1 hour as the maximum number of buckets is limited.

.. To Normalize the current interval by unit:

... Click *Add advanced options > Normalize by unit*. 

... From the *Normalize by unit* dropdown, select *per hour*, then click *Close*.

.. To create hourly time intervals on date histogram:

... Close *Count of Records* editor by clicking *Close*.

... From the editor, click *order date*.

... Select *Customize time interval*.

... Change the *Minimum interval* to `1 hour`, then click *Close*.

. To hide the *Horizontal axis* label, open the *Bottom Axis* menu, then deselect *Show*.

=== View the cumulative number of products sold on weekends

To determine the number of orders made only on Saturday and Sunday, create an area chart, then add it to the dashboard.

. Open *Lens*.

. From the *Chart Type* dropdown, select *Area*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_advanced_2_1_1.png[Chart type menu with Area selected]

. Configure the cumulative sum of the store orders.

.. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *Records* to the visualization builder.

.. From the editor, click *Count of Records*.

.. From *Select a function*, click *Cumulative sum*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Cumulative orders during weekend days`, then click *Close*.

. Filter the results to display the data for only Saturday and Sunday.

.. From the editor, click the *Drop a field or click to add* field for *Break down by*. 

.. From *Select a function*, click *Filters*.

.. Click *All records*.

.. In the *KQL* field, enter `day_of_week : "Saturday" or day_of_week : "Sunday"`. This <<kuery-query,{kib} KQL filter>> will match documents where `day_of_week` matches exactly `Saturday` or `Sunday`. 

Hint: A simpler way to achieve the same effect is typing a filter in KQL bar above the chart. However, there are powerful advantages of using Filters aggregation over KQL bar:
 - you can add only one filter to KQL bar, but you can add as many filters as needed with Filters aggregations,
 - KQL bar will filter all data used in visualization, whereas Filters aggregation will only filter the current layer so you can have a chart with both filtered and unfiltered data if needed.

.. Press Return.
