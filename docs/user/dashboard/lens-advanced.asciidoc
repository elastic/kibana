[[custom-time-interval]]
=== View a date histogram with a custom time interval

It is common to use the automatic date histogram interval, but sometimes you want a larger or smaller
interval. For performance reasonse, *Lens* lets you choose the minimum time interval, not the exact time interval. The performance limit is controlled by the <<histogram-maxbars, `histogram:maxBars`>> setting and the <<set-time-filter,time range>>. 

If you are using your own data, use one of the following options to see hourly sales over the last 30 days:

* View less than 30 days at a time, then use the time filter to select each day separately.

* Increase `histogram:maxBars` to at least 720, which is the number of hours in 30 days. This affects all visualizations and can reduce performance.

If you are using the sample data, use *Normalize unit*, which converts *Average sales per 12 hours*
into *Average sales per 12 hours (per hour)* by dividing the number of hours:

. Set the <<set-time-filter,time filter>> to *Last 30 days*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *Records* to the workspace.

. To zoom in on the data you want to view, click and drag your cursor across the bars.

=== Monitor multiple series with a date histogram

It is often required to monitor multiple series within a time interval. These series can have similar configurations with minor differences.
*Lens* copies a function when you drag it to the *Drop a field or click to add* field within the same group.

To quickly create many copies of a percentile metric that shows distribution of price over time:

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. Open the *Chart Type* dropdown, then select *Line*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *products.price* to the workspace.

Create the 95th percentile.

. In the layer pane, click *Median of products.price*.

. Click the *Percentile* function.

. In the *Display name* field, enter `95th`, then click *Close*.

To create the 90th percentile, duplicate the `95th` percentile.

. Drag the *95th* field to the *Drop a field or click to add* field in the *Vertical axis* group.

[[percentage-stacked-area]]
=== Compare the change in percentage over time

By default, *Lens* shows *date histograms* using a stacked chart visualization, which helps understand how distinct sets of documents perform over time. Sometimes it is useful to understand how the distributions of these sets change over time.
Combine *filters* and *date histogram* functions to see the change over time in specific
sets of documents. To view this as a percentage, use a *Stacked percentage* bar or area chart.

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *Records* to the workspace.

. Open the *Chart type* dropdown, then select *Area percentage*.

For each category type, create a filter. 

. In the layer pane, click the *Drop a field or click to add* field for *Break down by*.

. Click the *Filters* function.

. Click *All records*, enter the following, then press Return:

* *KQL* &mdash; `category.keyword : *Clothing`

* *Label* &mdash; `Clothing`

[[compare-time-ranges]]
=== Compare time ranges

*Lens* allows you to compare the selected time range with historical data using the *Time shift* option. 

If multiple time shifts are used in a single chart, a multiple of the date histogram interval should be chosen, or the data points might not line up and gaps may appear.
For example, if a daily interval is used, shifting one series by *36h*, and another by *1d* is not recommended. You can reduce the interval to *12h*, or create two separate charts.

To compare current sales numbers with sales from a week ago, follow these steps: 

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. Open the *Chart Type* dropdown, then select *Line*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag *Records* to the workspace.

. In the layer pane, drag *Count of Records* to the *Drop a field or click to add* field in the *Vertical axis* group.

To create a week-over-week comparison, shift the second *Count of Records* by one week.

. In the layer pane, click *Count of Records [1]*.

. Open the *Add advanced options* dropdown, then select *Time shift*.

. Click *1 week ago*.
