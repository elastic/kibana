[[create-a-dashboard-of-panels-with-ecommerce-data]]
== Time series analysis with Lens

The tutorial uses sample data from the perspective of a shop owner looking
at sales trends, but this type of dashboard works on any type of data.
To create dashboard panels of the data, open the *Lens* visualization builder, then  
create the visualization panels that best display the data.
Before using this tutorial, you should be familiar with the <<kibana-concepts-analysts>>.

[[add-the-data-and-create-the-dashboard-advanced]]
=== Add the data and create the dashboard

If you are working with your own data, you should already have an <<index-patterns, index pattern>>.
To install the sample sales data:

. From the {kib} *Home* page, click *Try our sample data*.

. From *Sample eCommerce orders*, click *Add data*.

Then create a new dashboard:

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard*.

. On the *Dashboards* page, click *Create dashboard*.

. Set the <<set-time-filter,time filter>> to *Last 30 days*.

[[open-and-set-up-lens-advanced]]
=== Open and set up Lens

*Lens* is designed to help you quickly build visualizations for your dashboard, as shown in <<create-a-dashboard-of-panels-with-web-server-data,Build your first dashboard>>, while providing support for advanced usage as well.

Open the *Lens* editor, then make sure the correct fields appear.

. From the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. Make sure the *kibana_sample_data_ecommerce* index appears.

[[custom-time-interval]]
=== View a date histogram with a custom time interval

It is common to use the automatic date histogram interval, but sometimes you want a larger or smaller
interval. *Lens* only lets you choose the minimum time interval, not the exact time interval, for
performance reasons. The performance limit is controlled by the <<histogram-maxbars, `histogram:maxBars`>>
advanced setting and the overall time range. To see hourly sales over a 30 day time period, choose
one of these options:

* View less than 30 days at a time, then use the time picker to select each day separately.

* Increase `histogram:maxBars` from 100 to at least 720, which the number of hours in 30 days.
This affects all visualizations and can reduce performance.

* If approximation is okay, use the *Normalize unit* option. This can convert *Average sales per 12 hours*
into *Average sales per 12 hours (per hour)* by dividing the number of hours.

For the sample data, approximation is okay. To use the *Normalize unit* option:

. Set the <<set-time-filter,time filter>> to *Last 30 days*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *Records* to the visualization builder.

[[add-a-data-layer-advanced]]
=== Monitor multiple series within a date histogram

It is often required to monitor multiple series within a time interval. These series can be have similar configurations with few changes between one and another.
*Lens* copies a function when you drag and drop it to the *Drop a field or click to add*
field within the same group, or when you drag and drop to the *Duplicate* field on a different group.
You can also drag and drop using your keyboard. For more information, refer to <<drag-and-drop-keyboard-navigation,Create visualization panels with keyboard navigation>>.

To quickly create many copies of a percentile metric that shows distribution of price over time:

. From the *Chart Type* dropdown, select *Line*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_advanced_2_1.png[Chart type menu with Line selected]

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *products.price* to the visualization builder.

. Create the 95th percentile.

.. In the editor, click *Median of products.price*.

.. From *Select a function*, click *Percentile*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `95th`, then click *Close*.

. To create the 90th percentile, duplicate the `95th` percentile.

.. Drag and drop *95th* to *Drop a field or click to add*.

.. Click *95th [1]*, then enter `90` in the *Percentile* field.

.. In the *Display name* field enter `90th`, then click *Close*.

[[add-a-data-layer]]
==== Multiple chart types or index patterns in one visualization

You can add multiple metrics to a single chart type, but if you want to overlay
multiple chart types or index patterns, use a second layer. When building layered charts,
it is important to match the data on the horizontal axis so that it uses the same
scale. To add a line chart layer on top of an existing chart:

To compare product prices with customers traffic:

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *products.price* to the visualization builder.

.. In the *KQL* field, enter `response.keyword>=500 AND response.keyword<600`. 

.. From *Select a function*, click *Average*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Average of prices`, then click *Close*.

. From the *Chart Type* dropdown, select *Area*.

. Create a new layer to overlay with custom traffic.

. In the editor, click *+*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_advanced_3_1.png[Add new layer button]

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *customer_id* to the *Vertical Axis* of the newly created layer.

.. In the editor, click *Unique count of customer_id*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Unique customers`, then click *Close*.

. In the *Series color* field, enter *#D36086*, then click *Close*.

. For *Axis side*, click *Right*, then click *Close*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *order_date* to the *Horizontal Axis* of the newly created layer.

. From the new layer editor, click the *Chart type* dropdown, then click the line chart.
+

The visualization is done, but the legend uses a lot of space. Change the legend position to the top of the chart.

. From the *Legend* dropdown, select the top position.

. Click *Save and return*.

[[percentage-stacked-area]]
=== Compare the change in percentage over time

By default, *Lens* shows *date histograms* using a stacked chart visualization, which helps understand how distinct sets of documents perform over time. Sometimes it is useful to understand how the distributions of these sets change over time.
Combine *filters* and *date histogram* functions to see the change over time in specific
sets of documents. To view this as a percentage, use a *stacked percentage* bar or area chart.

To see sales change of product by type over time:

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *Records* to the visualization builder.

. Click *Bar vertical stacked*, then select *Area percentage*.

For each category type that you want to break down, create a filter. 

. In the editor, click the *Drop a field or click to add* field for *Break down by*.

. From *Select a function*, click *Filters*.

. Add the filter for the clothing category. 

.. Click *All records*.

.. In the *KQL* field, enter `category.keyword : *Clothing`. 

.. In the *Label* field, enter `Clothing`, then press Return.

. Add the filter for the shoes category. 

.. Click *Add a filter*.

.. In the *KQL* field, enter `category.keyword : *Shoes`. 

.. In the *Label* field, enter `Shoes`, then press Return.

. Add the filter for the accessories category. 

.. Click *Add a filter*.

.. In the *KQL* field, enter `category.keyword : *Accessories`. 

.. In the *Label* field, enter `Accessories`, then press Return.

Change the legend position to the top of the chart.

. From the *Legend* dropdown, select the top position.

[[view-the-cumulative-number-of-products-sold-on-weekends]]
=== View the cumulative number of products sold on weekends

To determine the number of orders made only on Saturday and Sunday, create an area chart, then add it to the dashboard.

. Open *Lens*.

. From the *Chart Type* dropdown, select *Area*.

. Configure the cumulative sum of the store orders.

.. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *Records* to the visualization builder.

.. From the editor, click *Count of Records*.

.. From *Select a function*, click *Cumulative sum*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Cumulative orders during weekend days`, then click *Close*.

. Filter the results to display the data for only Saturday and Sunday.

.. From the editor, click the *Drop a field or click to add* field for *Break down by*. 

.. From *Select a function*, click *Filters*.

.. Click *All records*.

.. In the *KQL* field, enter `day_of_week : "Saturday" or day_of_week : "Sunday"`, then press Return.
+
The <<kuery-query,KQL filter>> displays all documents where `day_of_week` matches `Saturday` or `Sunday`.

[[compare-time-ranges]]
=== Compare time ranges

*Lens* allows you to shift individual dimensions in time to compare the currently selected time range with historical data. 
To compare current sales numbers with sales from a week ago, follow these steps: 

. Open *Lens*.

. From the *Chart Type* dropdown, select *Line*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *Records* to the visualization builder.

. Copy the *Count of Records* series by dragging it to the empty drop target of the *Vertical axis* dimension group (*Drop a field or click to add*)

. Shift the second *Count of Records* series by one week to do a week-over-week comparison

.. Click the new *Count of Records [1]* dimension

.. Click *Add advanced options* below the field selector

.. Click *Time shift*

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_time_shift.png[Line chart with week-over-week sales comparison]

Time shifts can be used on any metric. The special shift *previous* will show the time window preceding the currently selected one, spanning the same duration.
For example if *Last 7 days* is selected in the time picker in the top right, *previous* will show data from 14 days ago to 7 days ago.

If multiple time shifts are used in a single chart, a multiple of the date histogram interval should be chosen - otherwise data points might not line up in the chart and empty spots can occur.
For example if a daily interval is used, shifting one series by *36h* and another one by *1d* is not recommended. In this scenario either reduce the interval to *12h* or create two separate charts.  

[discrete]
[[view-customers-over-time-by-continents]]
=== View table of customers by category over time

Tables are an alternative type of visualization for time series, useful when you want to read the actual values.
You can build a date histogram table, and group the customer count metric by category, like the continent registered in their profile.

In *Lens* you can split the metric in a table leveraging the *Columns* field, where each data value from the aggregation is used as column of the table and the relative metric value is shown.

To build a date histogram table:

. Open *Lens*.

. From the *Chart Type* dropdown, select *Table*.

.. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *customer_id* to the *Metrics* field of the editor.

.. From the editor, click *Unique count of customer_id*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Customers`, then click *Close*.

.. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *order_date* to the *Rows* field of the editor.

.. From the editor *Rows*, click the *order_date* field just dropped.

. Select *Customize time interval*.

. Change the *Minimum interval* to `1 days`, then click *Close*.

.. In the *Display name* field, enter `Sale`, then click *Close*.

To split the customers count by continent:

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop *geoip.continent_name* to the *Columns* field of the editor.
