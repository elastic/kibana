[[manage-panels]]
== Manage panels
When creating a panel, you can choose to add it to a dashboard, or to save it to the Visualize Library so it can be added to multiple dashboards later.

There are also some common options that you can configure on the various types of panels to make a dashboard easier to navigate and analyze.

[float]
[[save-the-markdown-panel]]
[[save-to-visualize-library]]
=== Save to the Visualize Library

To use a panel on multiple dashboards, you can save it to the *Visualize Library*. Any updates made to a shared panel is replicated to all dashboards where the panel is added.

There are three types of *Discover* interactions you can add to dashboard panels:

+
To enable panel interactions, configure <<settings-explore-data-in-context,`xpack.discoverEnhanced.actions.exploreDataInContextMenu.enabled`>> in kibana.yml. If you are using 7.13.0 and earlier, panel interactions are enabled by default.

+
To use saved search interactions, open the panel menu, then click *More > View saved search*.

In Discover, {ref}/esql-kibana.html[typing ES|QL queries] automatically shows a visualization. The visualization type depends on the content of the query: histogram, bar charts, etc. You can manually make changes to that visualization and edit its type and display options using the
pencil button image:images/esql-icon-edit-visualization.svg[pencil button].

You can then **Save** and add it to an existing or a new dashboard using the save button of the visualization image:images/esql-icon-save-visualization.svg[save button].

[float]
=== Create from dashboard

. From your dashboard, select **Add panel**.
. Choose **ES|QL** under **Visualizations**. An ES|QL editor appears and lets you configure your query and its associated visualization. The **Suggestions** panel can help you find alternative ways to configure the visualization.
