=== Dashboard drilldown

The dashboard drilldown allows you to navigate from one dashboard to another dashboard.
For example, you might have a dashboard that shows the overall status of multiple data centers.
You can create a drilldown that navigates from this dashboard to a dashboard
that shows a single data center or server.

This example shows a dashboard panel that contains a pie chart with a configured dashboard drilldown:

==== Try it: Create a dashboard drilldown

Create the *Host Overview* drilldown shown above.

*Set up the dashboards*

. Add the sample web logs data set.

. Create a new dashboard, called `Host Overview`, and include these visualizations
from the sample data set:
+
[%hardbreaks]
*[Logs] Heatmap*
*[Logs] Visitors by OS*
*[Logs] Host, Visits, and Bytes Table*
*[Logs] Total Requests and Bytes*
+
TIP: If you don’t see data for a panel, try changing the time range.

. Open the *[Logs] Web traffic* dashboard.

. Set a search and filter.
+
[%hardbreaks]
Search: `extension.keyword: ("gz" or "css" or "deb")`
Filter: `geo.src: CN`


*Create the drilldown*


. In the dashboard menu bar, click *Edit*.

. In *[Logs] Visitors by OS*, open the panel menu, and then select *Create drilldown*.

. Pick *Go to dashboard* action.

. Give the drilldown a name.

. Select *Host Overview* as the destination dashboard.

. Keep both filters enabled so that the drilldown carries over the global filters and date range.
+
Your input should look similar to this:

. Click *Create drilldown.*

. Save the dashboard.

If you don’t save the drilldown, and then navigate away, the drilldown is lost.

. In *[Logs] Visitors by OS*, click the `win 8` slice of the pie, and then select the name of your drilldown.
