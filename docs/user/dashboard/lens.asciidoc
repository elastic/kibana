== Tutorial: Create a dashboard of panels with web server data

You collected data from your web server, and you want to visualize and analyze the data on a dashboard. To create dashboard panels of the data, open the *Lens* visualization builder, then  
create the visualization panels that best display the data.

[discrete]
[[add-the-data-and-create-the-dashboard]]
=== Add the data and create the dashboard

To create visualizations of the data from the web server, add the data set, then create the dashboard.

. From the {kib} *Home* page, click *Try our sample data*.

. From *Sample web logs*, click *Add data*.

. Open the main menu, click *Dashboard*.

. Click *Create dashboard*.

[float]
[[open-and-set-up-lens]]
=== Open and set up Lens

With *Lens*, you identify the data fields you want to visualize, drag and drop the fields, then watch as
*Lens* uses heuristics to apply the fields and create a visualization for you.

. From the dashboard, click *Create panel*.

. On the *New visualization* window, click *Lens*.

. Make sure the *kibana_sample_data_logs* index appears.
+
The list of fields are dependent on the <<index-patterns,index pattern>>, <<set-time-filter,time filter>>, and field filters.

[[view-the-data-summaries]]
=== View the data summaries

For each field, *Lens* shows a summary depending on the type of data. Date fields show the time distribution, string fields show the top 10 values, 
and numeric fields show a detailed summary with the top 10 values and a value distribution.

To view the data summary for a field, click *i* next to the field.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_data_info_documents.png[Data summary analyzed documents]

*Lens* uses a sample of 5,000 documents to perform the field analysis. The bottom line of the summary shows the percentage of sampled documents over all available documents.

When *Lens* presents the top 10 values distribution, it also shows the percentage of *Other* values. For array value fields, the percentage distribution considers each value in the array as separate.

NOTE: The sum of all the *Other* fields can equal more than 100% by a small amount.

[discrete]
[[configure-the-multiaxis-chart]]
==== Configure the y-axes

There is a significant difference between the *timestamp per day* and *Unique visitors* data, which makes the *Unique visitors* data difficult to read. To improve the readability, 
display the *Unique visitors* data along a second y-axis, then change the formatting. When functions contain multiple formats, separate axes are created by default. 

. From the editor, click *Unique visitors* in the line chart layer.

. For *Axis side*, click *Right*, then click *Close*.
