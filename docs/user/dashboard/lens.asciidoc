<titleabbrev>Lens</titleabbrev>
++++

To create a visualization, drag the data fields you want to visualize to the workspace, then *Lens* uses visualization best practices to apply the fields and create a visualization that best displays the data. 

With *Lens*, you can:

* Create area, line, and bar charts with layers to display multiple indices and chart types.
* Change the aggregation function to change the data in the visualization.
* Create custom tables.
* Perform math on aggregations using *Formula*.
* Use time shifts to compare the data in two time intervals, such as month over month.
* Add annotations and reference lines.

==== Create visualizations

If you're unsure about the visualization type you want to use, or how you want to display the data, drag the fields you want to visualize onto the workspace, then let *Lens* choose for you. 

If you already know the visualization type you want to use, and how you want to display the data, use the following process.

Choose the visualization type. 

. Before you drag fields to the workspace, open the *Visualization type* dropdown, then select the visualization you want to use.  

. To view more visualizations that *Lens* automatically created for the fields, click *Suggestions*. If one of the *Suggestions* meets your visualization needs, click *Save and return* to add it to the dashboard.

Choose the data you want to visualize.

. Drag the fields directly to the layer pane. *Lens* automatically selects the aggregation function.

. If you want to learn more about the data a field contains, click the field.

. To visualize more than one {data-source}, click *Add layer*, select the layer type, then select the {data-source}.

Edit and delete.

. Click image:dashboard/images/lens_layerActions_8.5.0.png[Actions menu to clear Lens visualization layers] on the panel, then **Edit visualization**. 

. To change the aggregation *Quick function* and, click the field in the flyout.

[[lens-formulas]]
==== Use formulas to perform math

Formulas allow you to perform math on aggregated data. The most common formulas divide two values to produce a percent.

. In the layer pane, click a field.

. Click *Formula*, then enter the formula. 
+
Filter ratio example:: To filter a document set, use `kql=''`, then compare to other documents within the same grouping:
+
```
count(kql='response.status_code > 400') / count()
```
+
Week over week example:: To get the value for each grouping from the previous week, use `shift='1w'`.
+
```
percentile(system.network.in.bytes, percentile=99) /
percentile(system.network.in.bytes, percentile=99, shift='1w')
```
You are unable to combine different time shifts, such as `count(shift="1w") - count()` and `count(shift="1w") - count(shift="1m")`, with the *Top values* function.
+
Percent of total example:: To convert each grouping into a percent of the total, formulas calculate `overall_sum` for all groupings:
+
```
sum(products.base_price) / overall_sum(sum(products.base_price))
```
TIP: For detailed information on formulas, click image:dashboard/images/formula_reference.png[Formula reference icon].

. To accurately display the formula, select *Percent* from the *Value format* dropdown.

[float]
[[filter-the-data]]
==== Apply filters

You can use the <<semi-structured-search, query bar>> to create queries that filter all the data in a visualization, or use the layer pane and legend filters to apply filters based on field values.

[float]
[[filter-with-the-function]]
===== Apply multiple KQL filters

With the *Filters* function, you can apply more than one KQL filter, and apply a KQL filter to a single layer so you can visualize filtered and unfiltered data at the same time.

. In the layer pane, click a field.

. Click the *Filters* function.

. Click *Add a filter*, then enter the KQL filter you want to apply.
+
To try the *Filters* function on your own, refer to <<custom-ranges,Compare a subset of documents to all documents>>.

[float]
[[filter-with-the-advanced-option]]
===== Apply a single KQL filter

With the *Filter by* advanced option, you can assign a color to each filter group in *Bar* and *Line and area* visualizations, and build complex tables. For example, to display failure rate and the overall data.

. In the layer pane, click a field.

. Click *Add advanced options*, then select *Filter by*.

. Enter the KQL filter you want to apply.

[float]
[[filter-with-legend-filters]]
===== Apply legend filters

Apply filters to visualizations directly from the values in the legend. *Bar*, *Line and area*, and *Proportion* visualizations support legend filters.

In the legend, click the field, then choose one of the following options:

* *Filter for value* &mdash; Applies a filter that displays only the field data in the visualization.

* *Filter out value* &mdash; Applies a filter that removes the field data from the visualization.

[float]
[[configure-the-visualization-components]]
==== Configure the visualization components

Each visualization type comes with a set of components that you access from the editor toolbar.

The following component menus are available:

* *Visual options* &mdash; Specifies how to display area, line, and bar chart options. For example, you can specify how to display the labels in bar charts.

* *Labels* &mdash; Specifies how to display the labels for donut charts, pie charts, and treemaps. 

* *Legend* &mdash; Specifies how to display the legend. You can choose to display the legend inside or outside the visualization, truncate the legend values when they're too long, and <<customize-visualization-legend,select additional statistics to show>>.

* *Left axis*, *Bottom axis*, and *Right axis* &mdash; Specify how you want to display the chart axes. For example, add axis labels and change the orientation and bounds.

[float]
[[customize-visualization-legend]]
===== Customize a visualization legend

When creating or editing a visualization, you can customize the way the legend gets displayed, and the data it displays. To do that, look for the image:images/legend-icon.svg[Legend icon] icon.

image::images/legend-popover-8.16.0.png[Menu with options to customize the legend of a visualization, width=50%]

NOTE: The options available can vary based on the type of chart you're setting up. For example, showing additional statistics is only possible for time series charts.

**Change the legend's display**

With the **Visibility**, **Position**, and **Width** options, you can adjust the way the legend appears in or next to the visualization.

**Truncate long labels**

With the **Label truncation** option, you can keep your legend minimal in case of long labels that span over multiple lines.

**Show additional statistics for time series charts**

To make your legends as informative as possible, you can show some additional **Statistics** for charts with a timestamp on one of the axes, and add a **Series header**.

**Bar**, **Line** and **Area** charts can show the following values:

- **Average**: Average value considering all data points in the chart
- **Median**: Median value considering all data points in the chart
- **Minimum**: Minimum value considering all data points in the chart
- **Maximum**: Maximum value considering all data points in the chart
- **Range**: Difference between min and max values
- **Last value**: Last value considering all data points in the chart
- **Last non-null value:** Last non-null value
- **First value**: First value considering all data points in the chart
- **First non-null value**: First non-null value
- **Difference**: Difference between first and last values
- **Difference %**: % difference between first and last values
- **Sum**: Sum of al values plotted in the chart
- **Count**: number of data points plotted in the chart
- **Distinct Count**: number of data points with different values plotted in the chart
- **Variance**: Variance of all data points plotted in the chart
- **Std Deviation**: Standard deviation of all data points plotted in the chart
- **Current or last value**: The exact value of the current or last data point moused over


//Not part of release
//**Pie** charts can only show two static options:
//- **Value**
//- **Percentage**

All statistics are computed based on the selected time range and the aggregated data points shown in the chart, rather than the original data coming from {es}. 

For example, if the metric plotted in the chart is `Median(system.memory)` and the time range is *last 24 hours*, when you show the **Max** statistic in the Legend, the value that shows corresponds to the `Max[Median(system.memory)]` for the last 24 hours.

=== Frequently asked questions

For answers to common *Lens* questions, review the following. 

[discrete]
[[when-should-i-normalize-the-data-by-unit-or-use-a-custom-interval]]
.*When should I normalize the data by unit or use a custom interval?*
[%collapsible]
====
* *Normalize by unit* &mdash; Calculates the average for the interval. When you normalize the data by unit, the data appears less granular, but *Lens* is able to calculate the data faster. 

* *Customize time interval* &mdash; Creates a bucket for each interval. When you customize the time interval, you can use a large time range, but *Lens* calculates the data slower.

To normalize the interval: 

. In the layer pane, click a field.

. Click *Add advanced options > Normalize by unit*. 

. From the *Normalize by unit* dropdown, select an option, then click *Close*.

To create a custom interval:

. In the layer pane, click a field.

. Select *Customize time interval*.

. Change the *Minimum interval*, then click *Close*.

[discrete]
[[what-is-the-other-category]]
.*What data is categorized as Other?*
[%collapsible]
====
The *Other* category contains all of the documents that do not match the specified criteria or filters. 
Use *Other* when you want to compare a value, or multiple values, to a whole.

By default, *Group other values as "Other"* is enabled when you use the *Top values* function. 

To disable *Group other values as "Other"*, click a field in the layer pane, click *Advanced*, then deselect *Group other values as "Other"*.
====

[discrete]
[[how-can-i-include-documents-without-the-field-in-the-operation]]
.*How do I add documents without a field?*
[%collapsible]
====
By default, *Lens* retrieves only the documents from the fields. 
For bucket aggregations, such as *Top values*, you can add documents that do not contain the fields, 
which is helpful when you want to make a comparison to the whole documentation set.

. In the layer pane, click a field. 

. Click *Advanced*, then select *Include documents without this field*.
====

[discrete]
[[when-do-i-use-runtime-fields-vs-formula]]
.*When do I use runtime fields vs. formula?*
[%collapsible]
====
Use runtime fields to format, concatenate, and extract document-level fields. Runtime fields work across all of {kib} and are best used for smaller computations without compromising performance.

Use formulas to compare multiple {es} aggregations that can be filtered or shifted in time. Formulas apply only to *Lens* panels and are computationally intensive.

[[why-is-my-value-with-the-right-color-using-value-based-coloring]]
.*Why is my value the incorrect color when I use value-based coloring?*
[%collapsible]
====
Here's a short list of few different aspects to check:

* Make sure the value falls within the desired color stop value defined in the panel. Color stop values are "inclusive".

* Make sure you have the correct value precision setup. Value formatters could round the numeric values up or down.

* Make sure the correct color continuity option is selected. If the number is below the first color stop value, a continuity of type `Below` or `Above and below range` is required.

* The default values set by the Value type are based on the current data range displayed in the data table.

** If a custom `Number` configuration is used, check that the color stop values are covering the current data range.

** If a `Percent` configuration is used, and the data range changes, the colors displayed are affected.

[[dynamic-metric-coloring]]
.*How does dynamic coloring work for the metric visualization?*
[%collapsible]
====
In the color palette editor, if you select *Value type: Number* the colors are applied based on the *Primary metric* value.

The *Primary metric* refers to the large number displayed in each tile.

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/lens_primaryMetric.png[Illustration of where to find the primary metric in a metric visualization.]


If you select *Value type: Percent*, the primary metric values are mapped to a range between 0 and 100 percent. The bounds of the range depend on your configuration.

The logic is as follows. If there is a Breakdown dimension for multiple visualization tiles:

* When there is a *Maximum dimension*, the range is from zero to the value of your *Maximum dimension*.

* When there is no *Maximum dimension*, the range is from the smallest primary metric values to the greatest primary metric values.

If there is no Breakdown dimension for a single visualization tile:

* When there is a *Maximum dimension*, the range is from zero to the value of your *Maximum dimension*.

* When there is no *Maximum dimension*, *Value type: Percent* cannot be selected because there's no way to determine a range.
