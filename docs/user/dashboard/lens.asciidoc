[[view-the-data-summaries]]
===== View the data summaries

For each field, *Lens* displays a summary depending on the type of data. To analyze the fields, *Lens* uses a sample of 5,000 documents. 
Each summary displays the percentage of sampled documents over all available documents.

To view a data summary, click *i* next to the field.

Each data type display the following summaries:

* *Date* &mdash; Displays the time distribution.

* *String* &mdash; Displays the top 10 values.

* *Numeric* &mdash; Displays the top 10 values and a value distribution. When *Lens* displays the top 10 values distribution, the percentage of *Other* values is also displayed. 
For array value fields, the percentage distribution considers each value in the array as separate.

TIP: *Other* can equal more than 100% by a small amount.

[[lens-faq]]
==== Frequently asked questions

For the answers to common *Lens* questions, review the following. 

[float]
[[kql-]]
===== When should I use the top filter bar, filters function, or "Filter by"?

Using the top <<semi-structured-search>> bar is best when you want to focus on a known set of
data for all the visualization results. These top level filters are combined with other filters
using AND logic.

Use the *Filters* function in the following scenarios:

* When you want to apply more than one KQL filter to the visualization.

* When you want to apply the KQL filter to a single layer, which allows you to visualize filtered and unfiltered data.

Use the *Filter by* advanced option in the following scenarios:

* When you want to assign a custom color to each filter in a bar, line or area chart.

* When you want to build a complex table, such as showing both failure rate and overall.

[float]
[[when-should-i-normalize-the-data-by-unit-or-use-a-custom-interval]]
===== When should I normalize the data by unit or use a custom interval?

* *Normalize by unit* &mdash; Calculates the average for the specified interval. When you normalize the data by unit, the data appears less granular, but *Lens* is able to calculate the data faster. 

* *Customize time interval* &mdash; Creates a bucket for each specified interval. When you customize the time interval, you can use a large time range, but *Lens* calculates the data slower.

To normalize the interval: 

. In the editor, click a field.

. Click *Add advanced options > Normalize by unit*. 

. From the *Normalize by unit* dropdown, select an option, then click *Close*.

To create a custom interval:

. In the editor, click a field.

. Select *Customize time interval*.

. Change the *Minimum interval*, then click *Close*.

[float]
[[can-i-show-value-labels-for-my-chart]]
===== How do I display value labels?

A subset of *Lens* visualizations support value labels.

* *Bar* and *Horizontal Bar*
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_value_labels_xychart_toggle.png[Lens Bar chart value labels menu]

NOTE: In bar charts, you are unable to move the label positions.

* *Pie*, *Donut*, and *Treemap*

[float]
[[what-is-the-other-category]]
===== What data is categorized as Other?

The *Other* category contains all of the documents that do not match the specified criteria or filters. 
Use *Other* when you want to compare a value, or multiple values, to a whole.
By default, *Group other values as "Other"* is enabled when you select the *Top values* function. 

To disable *Group other values as "Other"*:

. In the editor, click *Advanced*. 

. Deselect *Group other values as "Other"*.

[float]
[[how-can-i-include-documents-without-the-field-in-the-operation]]
===== How can I include documents without the field?

By default, *Lens* retrieves only the documents from the specified field. 
For bucket aggregations, such as *Top values*, you can choose to include documents that do not contain the specified field, 
which is helpful when you want to compare to the whole documentation set.

. In the editor, click *Advanced*.

. Select *Include documents without this field*.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-select-color-for-specific-bar-or-point]]
===== How do I change the color for a single data point?

*Lens* provides you with color pallettes that you can apply to the entire visualization, but you are unable to change the color for a single data point, such as a bar or line.

[float]
[[can-i-sort-by-multiple-columns]]
===== How do I sort by multiple columns?

Multiple column sorting is unsupported in *Lens*, but is supported in *Discover*. For information on how to sort multiple columns in *Discover*, 
refer to <<explore-fields-in-your-data,Explore the fields in your data>>.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-sort-dimensions-in-a-chart]]
===== How do I sort the dimensions in a chart?

Sorting dimensions in visualizations is unsupported in *Lens*.

You can sort the dimensions for a single column in data tables: click the column header, then select the sorting criteria you want to use.
If you use the dimension as `Columns`, then all the columns that belong to the same dimension are sorted in the table.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-use-saved-serches-in-lens]]
===== How do I visualize saved searches?

Visualizing saved searches in unsupported in *Lens*.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-decrease-or-increase-the-number-of-suggestions]]
===== How do I change the number of suggestions?

Configuring the *Suggestions* that *Lens* automatically populates is unsupported.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-use-different-indexpatterns-in-lens]]
===== Can I visualize multiple index patterns in a single visualization?

You can create *Bar*, *Line* and *Area* charts from multiple index patterns.

Each *Layer* in a visualization is associated with an index pattern and mutiple *Layers* can be combined together within the same visualization. Each *Layer* also has a chart switcher button in order to select the best type of visualization for the specific dataset.
You can also change the index pattern for a single *Layer*.

[float]
[[why-my-field-x-is-missing-from-the-fields-list]]
===== Why is my field X missing from the fields list?

*Lens* does not support the visualization of full-text fields, therefore it is not showing them in the data summary.

[float]
[[how-to-handle-gaps-in-time-series-visualizations]]
===== How do I handle gaps in time series visualizations?

*Lens* provides a set of features to handle missing values for *Area* and *Line* charts, which is useful for sparse data in time series data.

To select a different way to represent missing values, open the *Visual options* menu, then select how to handle missing values. The default is to hide the missing values.

[[is-it-possible-to-change-the-scale-of-Y-axis]]
===== Is it possible to statically define the scale of the y-axis in a visualization?

Yes, you can set the bounds on bar, line and area chart types in Lens, unless using percentage mode. Bar
and area charts must have 0 in the bounds. Logarithmic scales are unsupported in *Lens*.
To set the y-axis bounds, click the icon representing the axis you want to customize.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-have-pagination-for-datatable]]
===== Is it possible to have pagination in a data table?

Pagination in a data table is unsupported in *Lens*. However, the <<types-of-visualizations,aggregation-based data table>> supports pagination.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-have-more-than-one-Y-axis-scale]]
===== Is it possible to have more than one y-axis scale in visualizations?

*Lens* lets you pick, for each Y dimension, up to two distinct axis: *left* and *right*. Each axis can have a different scale.
