[[view-the-data-summaries]]
===== View the data summaries

For each field, *Lens* displays a summary depending on the type of data. To analyze the fields, *Lens* uses a sample of 5,000 documents. 
Each summary displays the percentage of sampled documents over all available documents.

To view a data summary, click *i* next to the field.

Each data type display the following summaries:

* *Date* &mdash; Displays the time distribution.

* *String* &mdash; Displays the top 10 values.

* *Numeric* &mdash; Displays the top 10 values and a value distribution. When *Lens* displays the top 10 values distribution, the percentage of *Other* values is also displayed. 
For array value fields, the percentage distribution considers each value in the array as separate.

TIP: *Other* can equal more than 100% by a small amount.

[[lens-faq]]
==== Frequently asked questions

For the answers to common *Lens* questions, review the following. 

[float]
[[kql-]]
===== When should I use the Filter function instead of KQL filters?

The easiest way to apply KQL filters is to use <<semi-structured-search>>, but you can also use the *Filters* function in the following scenarios:

* When you want to apply more than one KQL filter to the visualization.

* When you want to apply the KQL filter to a single layer, which allows you to visualize filtered and unfiltered data.

[float]
[[when-should-i-normalize-the-data-by-unit-or-use-a-custom-interval]]
===== When should I normalize the data by unit or use a custom interval?

* *Normalize by unit* &mdash; Calculates the average for the specified interval. When you normalize the data by unit, the data appears less granular, but *Lens* is able to calculate the data faster. 

* *Customize time interval* &mdash; Creates a bucket for each specified interval. When you customize the time interval, you can use a large time range, but *Lens* calculates the data slower.

To normalize the interval: 

. In the editor, click a field.

. Click *Add advanced options > Normalize by unit*. 

. From the *Normalize by unit* dropdown, select an option, then click *Close*.

To create a custom interval:

. In the editor, click a field.

. Select *Customize time interval*.

. Change the *Minimum interval*, then click *Close*.

[float]
[[can-i-show-value-labels-for-my-chart]]
===== How do I display value labels?

A subset of *Lens* visualizations support value labels.

* *Bar* and *Horizontal Bar*

[float]
[[what-is-the-other-category]]
===== What data is categorized as Other?

The *Other* category contains all of the documents that do not match the specified criteria or filters. 
Use *Other* when you want to compare a value, or multiple values, to a whole.
By default, *Group other values as "Other"* is enabled when you select the *Top values* function. 

To disable *Group other values as "Other"*:

. In the editor, click *Advanced*. 

. Deselect *Group other values as "Other"*.

[float]
[[how-can-i-include-documents-without-the-field-in-the-operation]]
===== How can I include documents without the field?

By default, *Lens* retrieves only the documents from the specified field. 
For bucket aggregations, such as *Top values*, you can choose to include documents that do not contain the specified field, 
which is helpful when you want to compare to the whole documentation set.

. In the editor, click *Advanced*.

. Select *Include documents without this field*.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-use-different-indexpatterns-in-lens]]
===== Can I visualize multiple index patterns in a single visualization?

You can create *Bar*, *Line* and *Area* charts from multiple index patterns.

Each *Layer* in a visualization is associated with an index pattern and mutiple *Layers* can be combined together within the same visualization. Each *Layer* also has a chart switcher button in order to select the best type of visualization for the specific dataset.
You can also change the index pattern for a single *Layer*.

[float]
[[why-my-field-x-is-missing-from-the-fields-list]]
===== Why is my field X missing from the fields list?

*Lens* does not support the visualization of full-text fields, therefore it is not showing them in the data summary.

[float]
[[how-to-handle-gaps-in-time-series-visualizations]]
===== How do I handle gaps in time series visualizations?

*Lens* provides a set of features to handle missing values for *Area* and *Line* charts, which is useful for sparse data in time series data.

To select a different way to represent missing values, open the *Visual options* menu, then select how to handle missing values. The default is to hide the missing values.
