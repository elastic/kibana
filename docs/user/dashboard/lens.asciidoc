==== Open and set up Lens

Open *Lens*, then explore the fields in your data. The list of fields are determined by the index pattern and time filter.

. On the dashboard, click *Create visualization*.

. In *Lens*, <<set-time-filter,set the time filter>>. 

. To view the fields in the a different index pattern, click the index pattern, then select a different index pattern from the dropdown.

. Scan through the list of fields to see whatâ€™s in your data.
+
TIP: For sparse datasets, *Empty fields* can contain data, which you can use to create visualizations.

. To filter the data fields, use the following options:

* Enter the field name in the *Search field names* field. 

* Click *Field by type*, then select the filter. To show all fields in the index pattern, deselect *Only show fields with data*.

[[view-the-data-summaries]]
===== View the data summaries

For each field, *Lens* displays a summary depending on the type of data. To analyze the fields, *Lens* uses a sample of 5,000 documents. 
Each summary displays the percentage of sampled documents over all available documents.

To view a data summary, click *i* next to the field.

Each data type display the following summaries:

* *Date* &mdash; Displays the time distribution.

* *String* &mdash; Displays the top 10 values.

* *Numeric* &mdash; Displays the top 10 values and a value distribution. When *Lens* displays the top 10 values distribution, the percentage of *Other* values is also displayed. 
For array value fields, the percentage distribution considers each value in the array as separate.

TIP: *Other* can equal more than 100% by a small amount.

[[lens-formulas]]
==== Use formulas to perform math

Formulas let you perform math on aggregated data in Lens by typing
math and quick functions. To access formulas,
click the *Formula* tab in the dimension editor. Access the complete
reference for formulas from the help menu.

The most common formulas are dividing two values to produce a percent.
To display accurately, set *Value format* to *Percent*.

Filter ratio::

Use `kql=''` to filter one set of documents and compare it to other documents within the same grouping.
For example, to see how the error rate changes over time:
+
```
count(kql='response.status_code > 400') / count()
```

Week over week:: Use `shift='1w'` to get the value of each grouping from
the previous week. Time shift should not be used with the *Top values* function.
+
```
percentile(system.network.in.bytes, percentile=99) /
percentile(system.network.in.bytes, percentile=99, shift='1w')
```

Percent of total:: Formulas can calculate `overall_sum` for all the groupings,
which lets you convert each grouping into a percent of total:
+
```
sum(products.base_price) / overall_sum(sum(products.base_price))
```

[[lens-faq]]
==== Frequently asked questions

For the answers to common *Lens* questions, review the following. 

[float]
[[kql-]]
===== When should I use the top filter bar, filters function, or "Filter by"?

Using the top <<semi-structured-search>> bar is best when you want to focus on a known set of
data for all the visualization results. These top level filters are combined with other filters
using AND logic.

Use the *Filters* function in the following scenarios:

* When you want to apply more than one KQL filter to the visualization.

* When you want to apply the KQL filter to a single layer, which allows you to visualize filtered and unfiltered data.

Use the *Filter by* advanced option in the following scenarios:

* When you want to assign a custom color to each filter in a bar, line or area chart.

* When you want to build a complex table, such as showing both failure rate and overall.

[float]
[[when-should-i-normalize-the-data-by-unit-or-use-a-custom-interval]]
===== When should I normalize the data by unit or use a custom interval?

* *Normalize by unit* &mdash; Calculates the average for the specified interval. When you normalize the data by unit, the data appears less granular, but *Lens* is able to calculate the data faster. 

* *Customize time interval* &mdash; Creates a bucket for each specified interval. When you customize the time interval, you can use a large time range, but *Lens* calculates the data slower.

To normalize the interval: 

. In the editor, click a field.

. Click *Add advanced options > Normalize by unit*. 

. From the *Normalize by unit* dropdown, select an option, then click *Close*.

To create a custom interval:

. In the editor, click a field.

. Select *Customize time interval*.

. Change the *Minimum interval*, then click *Close*.

[float]
[[can-i-show-value-labels-for-my-chart]]
===== How do I display value labels?

A subset of *Lens* visualizations support value labels.

* *Bar* and *Horizontal Bar*
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_value_labels_xychart_toggle.png[Lens Bar chart value labels menu]

NOTE: In bar charts, you are unable to move the label positions.

* *Pie*, *Donut*, and *Treemap*

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_value_labels_partition_toggle.png[Lens Pie chart value labels menu]

[float]
[[what-is-the-other-category]]
===== What data is categorized as Other?

The *Other* category contains all of the documents that do not match the specified criteria or filters. 
Use *Other* when you want to compare a value, or multiple values, to a whole.
By default, *Group other values as "Other"* is enabled when you select the *Top values* function. 

To disable *Group other values as "Other"*:

. In the editor, click *Advanced*. 

. Deselect *Group other values as "Other"*.

[float]
[[how-can-i-include-documents-without-the-field-in-the-operation]]
===== How can I include documents without the field?

By default, *Lens* retrieves only the documents from the specified field. 
For bucket aggregations, such as *Top values*, you can choose to include documents that do not contain the specified field, 
which is helpful when you want to compare to the whole documentation set.

. In the editor, click *Advanced*.

. Select *Include documents without this field*.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-select-color-for-specific-bar-or-point]]
===== How do I change the color for a single data point?

*Lens* provides you with color pallettes that you can apply to the entire visualization, but you are unable to change the color for a single data point, such as a bar or line.

[float]
[[can-i-sort-by-multiple-columns]]
===== How do I sort by multiple columns?

Multiple column sorting is unsupported in *Lens*, but is supported in *Discover*. For information on how to sort multiple columns in *Discover*, 
refer to <<explore-fields-in-your-data,Explore the fields in your data>>.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-sort-dimensions-in-a-chart]]
===== How do I sort the dimensions in a chart?

Sorting dimensions in visualizations is unsupported in *Lens*.

You can sort the dimensions for a single column in data tables: click the column header, then select the sorting criteria you want to use.
If you use the dimension as `Columns`, then all the columns that belong to the same dimension are sorted in the table.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-use-saved-serches-in-lens]]
===== How do I visualize saved searches?

Visualizing saved searches in unsupported in *Lens*.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-decrease-or-increase-the-number-of-suggestions]]
===== How do I change the number of suggestions?

Configuring the *Suggestions* that *Lens* automatically populates is unsupported.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-use-different-indexpatterns-in-lens]]
===== Can I visualize multiple index patterns in a single visualization?

You can create *Bar*, *Line* and *Area* charts from multiple index patterns.

Each *Layer* in a visualization is associated with an index pattern and mutiple *Layers* can be combined together within the same visualization. Each *Layer* also has a chart switcher button in order to select the best type of visualization for the specific dataset.
You can also change the index pattern for a single *Layer*.

[float]
[[why-my-field-is-missing-from-the-fields-list]]
===== Why is my field missing from the fields list?

Fields do not appear in the *Available fields* in the following scenarios:
* The field is a full-text field.
* The field is a `geo_point` field
* The field is a `flattened` field.
* The field is a `object` field.

Verify if the field appears in the *Empty fields* list. *Lens* uses heuristics to determine if the fields contain values. For sparse data sets, the heuristics are less precise.

[float]
[[how-to-handle-gaps-in-time-series-visualizations]]
===== How do I handle gaps in time series visualizations?

*Lens* provides a set of features to handle missing values for *Area* and *Line* charts, which is useful for sparse data in time series data.

To select a different way to represent missing values, open the *Visual options* menu, then select how to handle missing values. The default is to hide the missing values.
+

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-change-the-scale-of-Y-axis]]
===== Is it possible to statically define the scale of the y-axis in a visualization?

Yes, you can set the bounds on bar, line and area chart types in Lens, unless using percentage mode. Bar
and area charts must have 0 in the bounds. Logarithmic scales are unsupported in *Lens*.
To set the y-axis bounds, click the icon representing the axis you want to customize.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-have-pagination-for-datatable]]
===== Is it possible to have pagination in a data table?

Pagination in a data table is unsupported in *Lens*. However, the <<types-of-visualizations,aggregation-based data table>> supports pagination.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-have-more-than-one-Y-axis-scale]]
===== Is it possible to have more than one y-axis scale in visualizations?

*Lens* lets you pick, for each Y dimension, up to two distinct axis: *left* and *right*. Each axis can have a different scale.

[float]
[[why-is-my-value-with-the-right-color-using-value-based-coloring]]
===== Why is my value with the incorrect color when using value-based coloring?

There could be various reasons for a specific value in the table to have a different color than expected.

Here's a short list of few different aspects to check:
* Make sure the value falls within the desired color stop value defined in the panel. Color stop values are "inclusive".

* Make sure you have the right value precision setup: value formatters could round the numeric values up or down.

* Make sure the right color continuity option is selected: if the number is below the first color stop value, a continuity of type `Below` or `Above and below range` is required.

* The default values set by the Value type are based on the current data range displayed on the data table.

** If a custom `Number` configuration is used, check that the color stop values are covering the current data range.

** If a `Percent` configuration is used, and the data range changes, the colors displayed are affected.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-show-icons-in-datatable]]
===== Is it possible to display icons in data tables?

You can display icons with <<managing-index-patterns, field formatter>> in data tables.
