==== Open and set up Lens

Open *Lens*, then explore the fields in your data. The list of fields are determined by the index pattern and time filter.

. On the dashboard, click *Create panel*.

. On the *New visualization* window, click *Lens*.

. <<set-time-filter,Set the time filter>>. 

. To view the fields in the a different index pattern, click the index pattern, then select a different index pattern from the dropdown.

. Scan through the list of fields to see whatâ€™s in your data.
+
TIP: For sparse datasets, *Empty fields* can contain data, which you can use to create visualizations.

. To filter the data fields, use the following options:

* Enter the field name in the *Search field names* field. 

* Click *Field by type*, then select the filter. To show all fields in the index pattern, deselect *Only show fields with data*.

[[view-the-data-summaries]]
===== View the data summaries

For each field, *Lens* displays a summary depending on the type of data. To analyze the fields, *Lens* uses a sample of 5,000 documents. 
Each summary displays the percentage of sampled documents over all available documents.

To view a data summary, click *i* next to the field.

Each data type display the following summaries:

* *Date* &mdash; Displays the time distribution.

* *String* &mdash; Displays the top 10 values.

* *Numeric* &mdash; Displays the top 10 values and a value distribution. When *Lens* displays the top 10 values distribution, the percentage of *Other* values is also displayed. 
For array value fields, the percentage distribution considers each value in the array as separate.

TIP: *Other* can equal more than 100% by a small amount.

[[lens-faq]]
==== Frequently asked questions

For the answers to common *Lens* questions, review the following. 

[float]
[[kql-]]
===== When should I use the Filter function instead of KQL filters?

The easiest way to apply KQL filters is to use <<semi-structured-search>>, but you can also use the *Filters* function in the following scenarios:

* When you want to apply more than one KQL filter to the visualization.

* When you want to apply the KQL filter to a single layer, which allows you to visualize filtered and unfiltered data.

[float]
[[when-should-i-normalize-the-data-by-unit-or-use-a-custom-interval]]
===== When should I normalize the data by unit or use a custom interval?

* *Normalize by unit* &mdash; Calculates the average for the specified interval. When you normalize the data by unit, the data appears less granular, but *Lens* is able to calculate the data faster. 

* *Customize time interval* &mdash; Creates a bucket for each specified interval. When you customize the time interval, you can use a large time range, but *Lens* calculates the data slower.

To normalize the interval: 

. In the editor, click a field.

. Click *Add advanced options > Normalize by unit*. 

. From the *Normalize by unit* dropdown, select an option, then click *Close*.

To create a custom interval:

. In the editor, click a field.

. Select *Customize time interval*.

. Change the *Minimum interval*, then click *Close*.

NOTE: In bar charts, you are unable to move the label positions.

* *Pie*, *Donut*, and *Treemap*
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_value_labels_partition_toggle.png[Lens Pie chart value labels menu]

Other type of visualizations do not support labels yet.

[float]
[[what-is-the-other-category]]
===== What data is categorized as Other?

The *Other* category contains all of the documents that do not match the specified criteria or filters. 
Use *Other* when you want to compare a value, or multiple values, to a whole.
By default, *Group other values as "Other"* is enabled when you select the *Top values* function. 

To disable *Group other values as "Other"*:

. In the editor, click *Advanced*. 

. Deselect *Group other values as "Other"*.

[float]
[[how-can-i-include-documents-without-the-field-in-the-operation]]
===== How can I include documents without the field?

By default, *Lens* retrieves only the documents from the specified field. 
For bucket aggregations, such as *Top values*, you can choose to include documents that do not contain the specified field, 
which is helpful when you want to compare to the whole documentation set.

. In the editor, click *Advanced*.

. Select *Include documents without this field*.

[[is-it-possible-to-select-color-for-specific-bar-or-point]]
===== How do I change the color for a single data point?

*Lens* provides you with color pallettes that you can apply to the entire visualization, but you are unable to change the color for a single data point, such as a bar or line.

[float]
[[can-i-sort-by-multiple-columns]]
===== How do I sort by multiple columns?

Multiple column sorting is unsupported in *Lens*, but is supported in *Discover*. For information on how to sort multiple columns in *Discover*, 
refer to <<explore-fields-in-your-data,Explore the fields in your data>>.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-sort-dimensions-in-a-chart]]
===== How do I sort the dimensions in a chart?

Sorting dimensions in visualizations is unsupported in *Lens* for charts.

Sorting is possible in *Lens* datatables, but it is limited to a single column. Click on the column header to sort by the column and select the sorting criteria.
Note that if the dimension is used within the `Columns` (transposed) then all columns that belong to the same dimension will be sorted.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-use-saved-serches-in-lens]]

Visualizing saved searches in unsupported in *Lens*.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-decrease-or-increase-the-number-of-suggestions]]
===== How do I change the number of suggestions?

Configuring the *Suggestions* that *Lens* automatically populates is unsupported.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-use-different-indexpatterns-in-lens]]
===== Is it possible to use different index patterns in a single visualization?

You can create *Bar*, *Line* and *Area* charts from multiple index patterns.

Each *Layer* in a visualization is associated with an index pattern and mutiple *Layers* can be combined together within the same visualization. Each *Layer* also has a chart switcher button in order to select the best type of visualization for the specific dataset.
At the same time it is possible to dynamically change the indexpattern for the *Layer* when required.

[float]
[[why-my-field-x-is-missing-from-the-fields-list]]
===== Why is my field X missing from the fields list in Lens?

*Lens* does not support the visualization of full-text fields, therefore it is not showing them in the data summary.
You will still see the `X.keyword` field, when available.

[float]
[[how-to-handle-gaps-in-time-series-visualizations]]
===== How to handle gaps in time series visualizations?

*Lens* provides a set of features to handle missing values for *Area* and *Line* visualization.
This is useful for sparse data in time series.

To select a different way to represent missing values, click on the *brush* button above the visualization in the editor to see a selection of strategies to handle missing values. The default strategy is to hide the gaps.
