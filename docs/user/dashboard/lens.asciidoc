==== View the data summaries

For each field, *Lens* shows a summary depending on the type of data. Date fields show the time distribution, string fields show the top 10 values, 
and numeric fields show a detailed summary with the top 10 values and a value distribution.

To view the data summary for a field, click *i* next to the field.

*Lens* uses a sample of 5,000 documents to analyze the fields. The bottom line of the summary shows the percentage of sampled documents over all available documents.

When *Lens* displays the top 10 values distribution, the percentage of *Other* values is also shown. For array value fields, the percentage distribution considers each value in the array as separate.

For sparse datasets, *Empty fields* can still contain data. it is possible that a field is marked as empty even if it has data within the given filters: 
Lens samples the first 500 documents for the given filters set to establish whether the field has data or it is empty.

The field is still usable in the visualization and if it contains data it will be correctly visualized.

In this case the search field box and the field filters can be useful to work with all fields in this case:

NOTE: The sum of the *Other* fields can equal more than 100% by a small amount.

[[drag-and-drop-keyboard-navigation]]
=== Create your visualizations faster with keyboard navigation

Lens has a fully accessible, continuously improved drag and drop system. By using keyboard navigation instead of a mouse, you can significantly speed up your work.

. Set a focus on the chosen item. Most of the draggable elements have two focus states. The inner focus state opens a panel with more detailed information or options. The outer one allows dragging an element. Tab through the page until you get the outer focus state on the chosen element:

Complete the following actions:

. Press Space bar to start dragging an item.

. Use Left and Right arrows to select where you want to drop the field.

. To duplicate an operation, use Left and Right arrows to select the `Drop a field or click to add` in the same group.

==== Frequently asked questions

For the answers to common *Lens* questions, review the following. 

[float]
[[how-does-the-percentage-chart-calculate-percentages]]
===== How does Lens calculate percentages in percentage charts?

Similar to filter ratio, percentage charts are useful for comparing one or multiple parts to a whole. 
Use percentage charts when you have bucketed aggregations and time series data.

The percentages for each value are computed for each bucket with the division between the metric for 
the value, and the metric of all documents. For example, the percentage for date histogram is calculated 
for each time bucket. If the bucket has 0 documents, then the percentage chart displays 0%, not a 100% value.

When you use a bucketed metric, such as *Top values*, you can display the <<what-is-the-other-category, *Other* field>> 
in the percentage chart. When you display the *Other* field, the final result displays the correct ratio.

[[can-i-show-value-labels-for-my-chart]]
===== How do I display value labels?

A subset of *Lens* visualizations support value labels. Value labels are unsupported in date histogram.

* *Bar* and *Horizontal Bar*

[float]
[[how-are-ip-address-sorted]]
===== How does Lens sort IP addresses?

In a *Data table* that contains IP address fields, *Lens* sorts the IP addresses by IPv4 and IPv6 formats.
To easily find IP addresses within the same subset, each block of IP addresses is compared and sorted. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_ipv4_sorting.png[Lens datatable with IPv4 sorted field]

When your data contains IPv4 and IPv6 fields, IPv4 addresses are mapped into IPv6-mapped addresses, and sorted as IPv6 addresses.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_ip_mixed_sorting.png[Lens datatable with IPv4 and IPv6 sorted field]

NOTE: Values grouped as *Other* always appear last.

[float]
[[what-is-the-other-category]]
===== What data is categorized as Other?

The *Other* category contains all of the documents that do not match the specified criteria or filters. 
Use *Other* when you want to compare a value, or multiple values, to a whole.
By default, *Group other values as "Other"* is enabled when you select the *Top values* function. 

To disable *Group other values as "Other"*:

. In the editor, click *Advanced*. 

. Deselect *Group other values as "Other"*.

[float]
[[how-can-i-include-documents-without-the-field-in-the-operation]]
===== How can I include documents without the field?

By default, *Lens* retrieves only the documents from the specified field. 
For bucket aggregations, such as *Top values*, you can choose to include documents that do not contain the specified field, 
which is helpful when you want to compare to the whole documentation set.

. In the editor, click *Advanced*.

. Select *Include documents without this field*.

[[is-it-possible-to-select-color-for-specific-bar-or-point]]
===== How do I change the color for a single data point?

*Lens* provides you with color pallettes that you can apply to the entire visualization, but you are unable to change the color for a single data point, such as a bar or line.

[float]
[[can-i-sort-by-multiple-columns]]
===== How do I sort by multiple columns?

Multiple column sorting is unsupported in *Lens*, but is supported in *Discover*. For information on how to sort multiple columns in *Discover*, 
refer to <<explore-fields-in-your-data,Explore the fields in your data>>.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-inspect-elasticsearch-queries]]
===== How do I inspect {es} queries?

Inspecting {es} queries in visualizations is unsupported in *Lens*. 

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-sort-dimensions-in-a-chart]]
===== How do I sort the dimensions in a chart?

Sorting dimensions in visualizations is unsupported in *Lens*.

[float]
[[is-it-possible-to-use-saved-serches-in-lens]]
===== How do I visualize saved searches?

Visualizing saved searches in unsupported in *Lens*.
