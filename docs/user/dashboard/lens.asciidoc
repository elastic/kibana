[[lens]]
=== Lens

To create visualization panels with *Lens*, you drag the data fields you want to visualize to the workspace, then *Lens* uses heuristics to apply each field and create a visualization for you. 

With *Lens*, you can:

* Create area, line, and bar charts with multiple layers, indices, and visualization types.
* Change the aggregation function and labels to customize the data.
* Perform math on aggregations using *Formula*.
* Use time shifts to compare data for two time intervals, such as month over month.

[[create-the-visualization-panel]]
==== Create visualizations

If you're unsure about the visualization type you want to use, or how you want to display the data, drag the fields you want to visualize onto the workspace, then let *Lens* choose for you. 

If you already know the visualization type you want to use, and how you want to display the data, use the following process:

* *Choose the visualization type.* Open the *Chart type* dropdown, then select the visualization type before you drag any fields.  
+
To view more visualizations that *Lens* automatically created for the fields, click the *Suggestions*. If one of the *Suggestions* meets your visualization needs, click *Save and return* to add it to the dashboard.

* *Choose the data you want to visualize.* Drag the fields directly to the layer pane. *Lens* automatically selects the aggregation function.
+
If you want to learn more about the data a field contains, click *i* next to the field.

* *Edit and delete.* To change the *Quick function* and display options, click the field in the layer pane. To delete a field, close the configuration options, then click *X* next to the field.

[float]
[[change-the-fields]]
==== Change the fields list

Change the fields list to display a different index pattern, different time range, or add your own fields.

* To create a visualization with fields in a different index pattern, open the *Change index pattern* dropdown, then select the index pattern. 

* If the fields list is empty, change the <<set-time-filter,time filter>>.

* To add fields, open the action menu (*...*) next to the *Change index pattern* dropdown, then select *Add field to index pattern*.

For more information about adding fields to index patterns and examples, refer to <<runtime-fields>>.

[float]
[[lens-formulas]]
==== Use formulas to perform math

Formulas allow you to perform math on aggregated data. The most common formulas divide two values to produce a percent.

. In the layer pane, click a field.

. Click *Formula*, then enter the formula. 
+
Filter ratio example:: Use `kql=''` to filter one set of documents, then compare the document set to other documents within the same grouping:
+
See how the error rate changes over time:
+
```
count(kql='response.status_code > 400') / count()
```
+
Week over week example:: Use `shift='1w'` to get the value of each grouping from the previous week. Time shift should not be used with the *Top values* function.
+
```
percentile(system.network.in.bytes, percentile=99) /
percentile(system.network.in.bytes, percentile=99, shift='1w')
```
+
Percent of total example:: Formulas can calculate `overall_sum` for all the groupings,
which lets you convert each grouping into a percent of total:
+
```
sum(products.base_price) / overall_sum(sum(products.base_price))
```
+
TIP: For detailed information on formulas, click image:dashboard/images/formula_reference.png[Formula reference icon].

. To accurately display the formula, select *Percent* from the *Value format* dropdown.

[float]
[[compare-data-with-time-offsets]]
==== Compare differences over time

Compare your real-time data set to the results that are offset by a time increment. For example, you can compare the real-time percentage of a user CPU time spent to the results offset by one hour. 

. In the layer pane, click the field you want to offset.

. From the *Add advanced options* dropdown, select *Time shift*.

. Select the time offset increment. 

For a time shift example, refer to <<compare-time-ranges>>.

[float]
[[create-custom-tables]]
==== Create custom tables

*Lens* tables are highly customizable, and provide you with text alignment, value formatting, coloring options, and more.

. From the *Chart type* dropdown, select *Table*. 

. Drag the fields you want to visualize to the workspace. 

. To sort or hide the columns, click the arrow next to the column heading, then select an option.
+
All columns that belong to the same layer pane group are sorted in the table.

. To change the display options, click a *Metrics* field, then configure the following options:

* *Display name* &mdash; Specifies the field display name. 

* *Value format* &mdash; Specifies how the field value displays in the table. 

* *Text alignment* &mdash; Aligns the values in the cell to the *Left*, *Center*, or *Right*.

* *Hide column* &mdash; Hides the column for the field.

* *Summary row* &mdash; Adds a row that displays the summary value. When specified, allows you to enter a *Summary label*.

* *Color by value* &mdash; Applies color to the cell or text values. To change the color, click *Edit*.

[float]
[[filter-the-data]]
==== Filter the data

Apply filters to visualizations directly from the values in the legend. Only *Bar*, *Line and area*, and *Proportion* visualizations support legend filters.

. In the legend, click the field.

. Choose one of the following options:

* *Filter for value* &mdash; Applies a filter that displays only the field data in the visualization.

* *Filter out value* &mdash; Applies a filter that removes the field data from the visualization.

[[lens-faq]]
==== Frequently asked questions

For the answers to common *Lens* questions, review the following. 

[discrete]
[[kql]]
.When should I use KQL filters, the Filters function, or the Filter by option?
[%collapsible]
====
To focus on a known set of data for all the visualization results, use the <<semi-structured-search, KQL *Search*>> field.

Use the *Filters* function to apply:

* More than one KQL filter.

* The KQL filter to a single layer, which allows you to visualize filtered and unfiltered data.

Use the *Filter by* advanced option to:

* Assign a custom color to each filter group in a bar, line, or area chart.

* Build a complex table. For example, to display the failure rate and overall data.

[discrete]
[[when-should-i-normalize-the-data-by-unit-or-use-a-custom-interval]]
.When should I normalize the data by unit or use a custom interval?
[%collapsible]
====
* *Normalize by unit* &mdash; Calculates the average for the interval. When you normalize the data by unit, the data appears less granular, but *Lens* is able to calculate the data faster. 

* *Customize time interval* &mdash; Creates a bucket for each interval. When you customize the time interval, you can use a large time range, but *Lens* calculates the data slower.

To normalize the interval: 

. In the layer pane, click a field.

. Click *Add advanced options > Normalize by unit*. 

. From the *Normalize by unit* dropdown, select an option, then click *Close*.

To create a custom interval:

. In the layer pane, click a field.

. Select *Customize time interval*.

. Change the *Minimum interval*, then click *Close*.
====

[discrete]
[[what-is-the-other-category]]
.What data is categorized as Other?
[%collapsible]
====
The *Other* category contains all of the documents that do not match the specified criteria or filters. 
Use *Other* when you want to compare a value, or multiple values, to a whole.

By default, *Group other values as "Other"* is enabled when you use the *Top values* function. 

To disable *Group other values as "Other"*, click a field in the layer pane, click *Advanced*, then deselect *Group other values as "Other"*.
====

[discrete]
[[how-can-i-include-documents-without-the-field-in-the-operation]]
.How do I add documents without a field?
[%collapsible]
====
By default, *Lens* retrieves only the documents from the fields. 
For bucket aggregations, such as *Top values*, you can add documents that do not contain the fields, 
which is helpful when you want to make a comparison to the whole documentation set.

. In the layer pane, click a field. 

. Click *Advanced*, then select *Include documents without this field*.

[discrete]
[[is-it-possible-to-have-more-than-one-Y-axis-scale]]
.Can I add more than one y-axis scale to a visualization?
[%collapsible]
====
For each y-axis, you can select *Left* and *Right*, and configure a different scale.
====

[discrete]
[[why-is-my-value-with-the-right-color-using-value-based-coloring]]
.Why is my value the incorrect color when I use value-based coloring?
[%collapsible]
====
Here's a short list of few different aspects to check:
* Make sure the value falls within the desired color stop value defined in the panel. Color stop values are "inclusive".

* Make sure you have the correct value precision setup. Value formatters could round the numeric values up or down.

* Make sure the correct color continuity option is selected. If the number is below the first color stop value, a continuity of type `Below` or `Above and below range` is required.

* The default values set by the Value type are based on the current data range displayed in the data table.

** If a custom `Number` configuration is used, check that the color stop values are covering the current data range.

** If a `Percent` configuration is used, and the data range changes, the colors displayed are affected.

[[why-my-field-is-missing-from-the-fields-list]]
===== Why is my field missing from the fields list?

Fields do not appear in the *Available fields* in the following scenarios:
* The field is a full-text field.
* The field is a `geo_point` field
* The field is a `flattened` field.
* The field is a `object` field.

Verify if the field appears in the *Empty fields* list. *Lens* uses heuristics to determine if the fields contain values. For sparse data sets, the heuristics are less precise.

[float]
[[how-to-handle-gaps-in-time-series-visualizations]]
.What do I do with gaps in time series visualizations?
