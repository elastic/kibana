== Create custom dashboard actions

Custom dashboard actions, also known as drilldowns, allow you to create
workflows for analyzing and troubleshooting your data. Drilldowns apply only to the panel that you created the drilldown from, and are not shared across all of the panels. Each panel can have multiple drilldowns. 

{kib} supports three types drilldowns.

[cols="50, 50"]
|===

a| *Dashboard drilldown*

| image:images/drilldown_on_piechart.gif[Drilldown on pie chart that navigates to another dashboard]

Navigate from one dashboard to another,
taking the current time range, filters, and other parameters with you,
so the context remains the same, then continue your analysis from a new perspective.
For example, you might have a dashboard that shows the overall status of multiple data centers.
You can create a drilldown that navigates from the overall status dashboard to a dashboard
that shows a single data center or server.

a| *URL drilldown*

| image:images/url_drilldown_go_to_github.gif[Drilldown on pie chart that navigates to Github]

beta[] URL drilldowns allow you to navigate from a dashboard to an internal or external URL.
The destination URL can be dynamic, depending on the dashboard context or user interaction with a panel.
For example, you might have a dashboard that shows data from a Github repository.
You can create a drilldown that navigates from the dashboard to Github.

Some panels support multiple user interactions, also known as triggers, that you can create for a URL drilldown. 
The list of supported variables in the URL template depends on the trigger you choose.
For example, pie chart triggers occur automatically when you click a slice, but area chart triggers occur when you 
click a data point or select a range. You can create multiple URL drilldowns per panel and attach them to different triggers. 
For more information about triggers, refer to <<url_templating-language, URL templating language>>.

a| *Code drilldown*

| Third-party developers can create drilldowns.
To learn how to code drilldowns, refer to {kib-repo}blob/{branch}/x-pack/examples/ui_actions_enhanced_examples[this example plugin].

[NOTE]
==============================================
Some drilldowns are paid commercial features, while others are free.
