== Create custom dashboard actions

Custom dashboard actions, or _drilldowns_, allow you to create workflows for analyzing and troubleshooting your data. 
Drilldowns apply only to the panel that you created the drilldown from, and are not shared across all panels. Each panel can have multiple drilldowns.

Third-party developers can create drilldowns. To learn how to code drilldowns, refer to {kib-repo}blob/{branch}/x-pack/examples/ui_actions_enhanced_examples[this example plugin].

==== Dashboard drilldowns

Dashboard drilldowns enable you to open a dashboard from another dashboard,
taking the time range, filters, and other parameters with you
so the context remains the same. Dashboard drilldowns help you to continue your analysis from a new perspective.

For example, if you have a dashboard that shows the overall status of multiple data center,
you can create a drilldown that navigates from the overall status dashboard to a dashboard
that shows a single data center or server.

[[url-drilldowns]]
==== URL drilldowns

URL drilldowns enable you to navigate from a dashboard to internal or external URLs.
Destination URLs can be dynamic, depending on the dashboard context or user interaction with a panel.
For example, if you have a dashboard that shows data from a Github repository, you can create a URL drilldown
that opens Github from the dashboard panel.

Some panels support multiple interactions, also known as triggers. 
The <<url-template-variables,variables>> you use to create a <<url_templating-language, URL template>> depends on the trigger you choose. URL drilldowns support these types of triggers:

* *Single click* &mdash; A single data point in the panel.

* *Range selection* &mdash; A range of values in a panel.

For example, *Single click* has `{{event.value}}` and *Range selection* has `{{event.from}}` and `{{event.to}}`.
