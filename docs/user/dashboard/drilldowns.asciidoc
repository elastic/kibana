== Create custom dashboard actions

Custom dashboard actions, also known as drilldowns, allow you to create
workflows for analyzing and troubleshooting your data. Drilldowns apply only to the panel that you created the drilldown from, and are not shared across all of the panels. Each panel can have multiple drilldowns.

Third-party developers can create drilldowns. To learn how to code drilldowns, refer to {kib-repo}blob/{branch}/x-pack/examples/ui_actions_enhanced_examples[this example plugin].

=== Supported drilldowns

{kib} supports two types of drilldowns.

[NOTE]
==============================================
Some drilldowns are paid subscription features, while others are free.

==== Dashboard drilldowns

Dashboard drilldowns enable you to open a dashboard from another dashboard,
taking the time range, filters, and other parameters with you,
so the context remains the same. Dashboard drilldowns help you to continue your analysis from a new perspective.

For example, if you have a dashboard that shows the overall status of multiple data center,
you can create a drilldown that navigates from the overall status dashboard to a dashboard
that shows a single data center or server.

[[url-drilldown]]
==== URL drilldowns

beta[] URL drilldowns enable you to navigate from a dashboard to internal or external URLs.
Destination URLs can be dynamic, depending on the dashboard context or user interaction with a panel.
For example, if you have a dashboard that shows data from a Github repository, you can create a URL drilldown
that opens Github from the dashboard.

Some panels support multiple interactions, also known as triggers.
The <<variables,variables>> you use to create a <<url_templating, URL template>> depends on the trigger you choose. URL drilldowns support these types of triggers:

* *Single click* &mdash; A single data point in the visualization.

* *Range selection* &mdash; A range of values in a visualization.

For example, *Single click* has `{{event.value}}` and *Range selection* has `{{event.from}}` and `{{event.to}}`.

To disable URL drilldowns on your {kib} instance, disable the plugin:

["source","yml"]
-----------
url_drilldown.enabled: false

=== Try it: Create a dashboard drilldown

To create dashboard drilldowns, you create or locate the dashboards you want to connect, then configure the drilldown that allows you to easily open one dashboard from the other dashboard.

==== Create the dashboard

. Add the *Sample web logs* data.

. Create a new dashboard, then add the following panels:

* *[Logs] Heatmap*
* *[Logs] Host, Visits, and Bytes Table*
* *[Logs] Total Requests and Bytes*
* *[Logs] Visitors by OS*

If you don’t see data for a panel, try changing the <<set-time-filter,time filter>>.

. Save the dashboard. In the *Title* field, enter `Host Overview`.

. Open the *[Logs] Web traffic* dashboard.

. Set a search and filter.

=== Try it: Create a URL drilldown

beta[] To create URL drilldowns, you add <<variables,variables>> to a URL template, which configures the bahavior of the drilldown.

image:images/url_drilldown_go_to_github.gif[Drilldown on pie chart that navigates to Github]

. In the toolbar, click *Edit*.

. Open the *[Logs] Visitors by OS* panel menu, then select *Create drilldown*.

.. In the *Name* field, enter `Show on Github`.
