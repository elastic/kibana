== Use drilldowns for dashboard actions

Drilldowns, also known as custom actions, allow you to configure a
workflow for analyzing and troubleshooting your data.
For example, using a drilldown, you can navigate from one dashboard to another,
taking the current time range, filters, and other parameters with you,
so the context remains the same. You can continue your analysis from a new perspective.

Drilldowns are specific to the dashboard panel for which you create themâ€”they are not shared across panels. A panel can have multiple drilldowns.
