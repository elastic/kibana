== Create panels with the advanced editors

{kib} provides you with three advanced editors that you can use to manually create dashboard panels.

[[tsvb-advanced-editor]]
=== TSVB

*TSVB* is a time series data visualization editor that allows you to use the full power of the {es} aggregation framework. To use *TSVB*,
you can combine an infinite number of <<aggregation-reference,aggregations>> to display your data.

With *TSVB*, you can:

* View the data in several types of visualizations, including charts, data tables, and markdown panels.
* Display multiple <<index-patterns, index patterns>> in each visualization.
* Customize the data with labels and colors.

[[vega-advanced-editor]]
=== Vega

*Vega* and *Vega-Lite* provide the grammar language, using a JSON-based syntax, for building custom panels.

* *Vega* &mdash; A powerful and feature-rich grammar language.

* *Vega-Lite* &mdash; A simplified and easier to use grammar language.

*Vega* and *Vega-Lite* panels can display one or more data sources, including {es}, Elastic Map Service,
URL, or static data, and support <<reference-for-kibana-extensions,{kib} extensions>> that allow you to embed the panels on your dashboard and add interactive tools. With *Vega* and *Vega-Lite*, the types of 
panels you can create are endless.

Use *Vega* and *Vega-Lite* when you want to create visualizations with:

* Aggregations that use `nested` or `parent/child` mapping
* Aggregations without an index pattern
* Queries that use custom time filters
* Complex calculations
* Extracted data from _source instead of aggregations
* Scatter charts, sankey charts, and custom maps
* An unsupported visual theme

[[timelion-advanced-editor]]
=== Timelion

*Timelion* displays your data along a scale that changes color according to where your data falls on the specified scale. Use the gauge to show how metric
values relate to reference threshold values, or determine how a specified field is performing versus how it is expected to perform.

*Timelion* is driven by a simple expression language that you use to:

* Retrieve time series data
* Perform calculations to find the answers to complex questions
* Visualize the results
