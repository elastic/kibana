== Create panels with the advanced editors

{kib} provides you with three advanced editors that you can use to manually create dashboard panels.

[[tsvb-advanced-editor]]
=== TSVB

*TSVB* is a time series data visualization editor that allows you to use the full power of the {es} aggregation framework. 

With *TSVB*, you can:

* Combine an infinite number of <<aggregation-reference,aggregations>> to display your data.
* Annotate time series data with timestamped events from an {es} index.
* View the data in several types of visualizations, including charts, data tables, and markdown panels.
* Display multiple <<index-patterns, index patterns>> in each visualization.
* Customize the data with labels and colors.

[[vega-advanced-editor]]
=== Custom visualizations

*Vega* and *Vega-Lite* are visualization grammars that are integrated into {kib} for custom visualizations.

* *Vega-Lite* &mdash; A high-level grammar for rapid analysis

* *Vega* &mdash; A declarative language with support for interactivity

*Vega* and *Vega-Lite* panels can display one or more data sources, including {es}, Elastic Map Service,
URL, or static data, and support <<reference-for-kibana-extensions,{kib} extensions>> that allow you to embed the panels on your dashboard and add interactive tools.

Use *Vega* or *Vega-Lite* when you want to create visualizations with:

* Aggregations that use `nested` or `parent/child` mapping
* Aggregations without an index pattern
* Queries that use custom time filters
* Complex calculations
* Extracted data from _source instead of aggregations
* Scatter charts, sankey charts, and custom maps
* An unsupported visual theme

These grammars have some limitations: they do not support tables, and can't run queries conditionally.

[[timelion-advanced-editor]]
=== Timelion

*Timelion* is driven by a simple expression language that you use to:

* Retrieve time series data from one or more indices
* Perform math across two or more time series
* Visualize the results
