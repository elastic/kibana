== Add panels with advanced editors

{kib} provides you with three advanced editors that you can use to create dashboard panels.

[[tsvb-advanced-editor]]
=== TSVB

A time series data visualization builder that allows you to use the full power of the Elasticsearch aggregation framework. To use *TSVB*,
you can combine an infinite number of <<aggregation-reference,aggregations>> to display your data.

With *TSVB*, you can:

* Create visualizations, data tables, and markdown panels.
* Create visualizations with multiple indices.
* Change the aggregations and labels to customize the data.

[[vega-advanced-editor]]
=== Vega

Build custom visualizations using *Vega* and *Vega-Lite*, backed by one or more data sources including {es}, Elastic Map Service,
URL, or static data. Use the {kib} extensions to embed *Vega* in your dashboard, and add interactive tools. With *Vega*, then types of 
visualizations you can create are endless.

Use *Vega* and *Vega-Lite* when you want to create a visualization for:

* Aggregations that use `nested` or `parent/child` mapping
* Aggregations without an index pattern
* Queries that use custom time filters
* Complex calculations
* Extracting data from _source instead of aggregations
* Scatter charts, sankey charts, and custom maps
* Using an unsupported visual theme

*Vega* and *Vega-Lite* are declarative formats that:

* Create complex visualizations
* Use JSON and a different syntax for declaring visualizations
* Are not fully interchangeable

[[timelion-advanced-editor]]
=== Timelion

Displays your data along a scale that changes color according to where your data falls on the expected scale. Use the gauge to show how metric
values relate to reference threshold values, or determine how a specified field is performing versus how it is expected to perform.

*Timelion* is driven by a simple expression language that you use to:

* Retrieve time series data
* Perform calculation to tease out the answers to complex questions
* Visualize the results
