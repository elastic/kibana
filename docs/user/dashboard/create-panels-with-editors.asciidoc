== Create panels with editors

{kib} provides several editors that you can use to create panels of your data.

[cols="2"]
|===

| <<lens,*Lens*>>
| Create visualizations with the drag and drop editor.

| <<maps,*Maps*>>
| Create visualizations with your geographical data.

| <<tsvb,*TSVB*>>
| Create visualizations with your time series data.

| <<vega,*Vega*>>
| Create custom visualizations with the *Vega* and *Vega-Lite* grammars.

| <<add-aggregation-based-visualization-panels,*Aggregation based*>>
| Build most visualization types using {es} <<aggregation-reference,aggregations>>. 

| <<timelion,*Timelion*>>
| Create visualizations with your time series data using a simple expression language.

[[lens-editor]]
=== Lens

*Lens* is the drag and drop editor that creates visualizations of your data, recommended for most
users.

With *Lens*, you can:

* Use the automatically generated suggestions to change the visualization type.
* Create visualizations with multiple layers and indices.
* Change the aggregation and labels to customize the data.
* Perform math on aggregations using *Formula*.
* Use time shifts to compare data at two times, such as month over month.

[[tsvb-editor]]
=== TSVB

*TSVB* is a time series data visualization editor that allows you to use the full power of the {es} aggregation framework. 

With *TSVB*, you can:

* Combine an infinite number of <<aggregation-reference,aggregations>> to display your data.
* Annotate time series data with timestamped events from an {es} index.
* View the data in several types of visualizations, including charts, data tables, and markdown panels.
* Display multiple <<index-patterns, index patterns>> in each visualization.
* Customize the data with labels and colors.

[[custom-visualizations]]
=== Custom visualizations

*Vega* and *Vega-Lite* are visualization grammars that are integrated into {kib} for custom visualizations.

* *Vega-Lite* &mdash; A high-level grammar for rapid analysis.

* *Vega* &mdash; A declarative language with support for interactivity.

*Vega* and *Vega-Lite* panels can display one or more data sources, including {es}, Elastic Map Service,
URL, or static data, and support <<reference-for-kibana-extensions,{kib} extensions>> that allow you to embed the panels on your dashboard and add interactive tools.

Use *Vega* or *Vega-Lite* when you want to create visualizations with:

* Aggregations that use `nested` or `parent/child` mapping
* Aggregations without an index pattern
* Queries that use custom time filters
* Complex calculations
* Extracted data from _source instead of aggregations
* Scatter charts, sankey charts, and custom maps
* An unsupported visual theme

These grammars have some limitations: they do not support tables, and can't run queries conditionally.

For detailed *Vega* and *Vega-Lite* information and examples, refer to <<resources-and-examples,Resources and examples>>.

[[aggregation-based]]
=== Aggregation-based

With aggregation-based visualizations, you can:

* Create heat map, tag cloud, gauge, and goal visualizations
* Split charts up to three aggregation levels, which is more than *Lens* and *TSVB*
* Time series data is not required
* Use a <<save-open-search,saved search>> as an input
* Sort data tables and use the summary row and percentage column features
* Assign colors to series
* Extend features with plugins

Aggregation-based visualizations include the following limitations:

* Limited styling options
* Math is unsupported
* Multiple indices is unsupported

[float]
[[timelion-editor]]
=== Timelion

*Timelion* is driven by a simple expression language that you use to:

* Retrieve time series data from one or more indices
* Perform math across two or more time series
* Visualize the results
