[[pipeline-aggregations]]
=== Pipeline aggregations

Pipeline aggregations are dependent on the outputs calculated from other aggregations. Parent pipeline aggregations are provided with the output of the parent aggregation, and compute new buckets or aggregations that are added to existing buckets. Sibling pipeline aggregations are provided with the output of a sibling aggregation, and compute new aggregations for the same level as the sibling aggregation.
