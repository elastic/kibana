[[add-controls]]
=== Filter dashboard data with controls

*Controls* are interactive panels you add to your dashboards to filter and display only the data you want to explore.

There are three types of controls:

* *Options list* &mdash; Adds a dropdown that allows you to filter the data with one or more options that you select.
+
For example, if you are using the *[Logs] Web Traffic* dashboard from the sample web logs data, you can add an options list for the `machine.os.keyword` field that allows you to display only the logs generated from `osx` and `ios` operating systems.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/dashboard_controlsOptionsList_8.7.0.png[Options list control for the `machine.os.keyword` field with the `osx` and `ios` options selected]

* *Range slider* &mdash; Adds a slider that allows you to filter the data within a specified range of values. 
+
For example, if you are using the *[Logs] Web Traffic* dashboard from the sample web logs data, you can add a range slider for the `hour_of_day` field that allows you to display only the log data from 9:00AM to 5:00PM.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/dashboard_controlsRangeSlider_8.3.0.png[Range slider control for the `hour_of_day` field with a range of `9` to `17` selected]

* *Time slider* &mdash; Adds a time range slider that allows you to filter the data within a specified range of time, advance the time range backward and forward, and animate your change in data over the specified time range.
+
For example, you are using the *[Logs] Web Traffic* dashboard from the sample web logs data, and the global time filter is *Last 7 days*. When you add the time slider, you can click the previous and next buttons to advance the time range backward or forward, and click the play button to watch how the data changes over the last 7 days.

[[dashboard-links]]
=== Create links to other dashboards

preview::["This functionality is in technical preview, and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features."]

You can use *Links* panels to create links to other dashboards or external websites. When creating links to other dashboards, you have the option to carry the time range and query and filters to apply to the linked dashboard. Links to external websites follow the <<external-URL-policy,`externalUrl.policy`>> settings. *Links* panels support vertical and horizontal layouts and may be saved to the *Library* for use on other dashboards.

[[create-drilldowns]]
=== Customize interactions with drilldowns

Panels have built-in interactive capabilities that apply filters to the dashboard data. For example, when you drag a time range or click a pie slice, a filter for the time range or pie slice is applied. Drilldowns let you customize the interactive behavior while keeping the context of the interaction. 

There are three types of drilldowns you can add to dashboards:

* *Dashboard* &mdash; Navigates you from one dashboard to another dashboard. For example, create a drilldown for a *Lens* panel that navigates you from a summary dashboard to a dashboard with a filter for a specific host name.

* *URL* &mdash; Navigates you from a dashboard to an external website. For example, a website with the specific host name as a parameter. 

* *Discover* &mdash; Navigates you from a *Lens* dashboard panel to *Discover*. For example, create a drilldown for a *Lens* visualization that opens the visualization data in *Discover* for further exploration. 

Third-party developers can create drilldowns. To learn how to code drilldowns, refer to {kib-repo}blob/{branch}/x-pack/examples/ui_actions_enhanced_examples[this example plugin].

[float]
[[dashboard-drilldowns]]
==== Create dashboard drilldowns

Dashboard drilldowns enable you to open a dashboard from another dashboard, taking the time range, filters, and other parameters with you so the context remains the same. Dashboard drilldowns help you to continue your analysis from a new perspective.

For example, if you have a dashboard that shows the logs and metrics for multiple data centers, you can create a drilldown that navigates from the dashboard that shows multiple data centers, to a dashboard that shows a single data center or server.

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/dashboard_drilldownOnDataTable_8.3.gif[Drilldown on data table that navigates to another dashboard]

The panels you create using the following editors support dashboard drilldowns:

* *Lens*
* *Maps*
* *TSVB*
* *Vega*
* *Aggregation-based* area chart, data table, heat map, horitizontal bar chart, line chart, pie chart, tag cloud, and vertical bar chart
* *Timelion*

[float]
===== Create and set up the dashboards you want to connect

Use the <<gs-get-data-into-kibana,*Sample web logs*>> data to create a dashboard and add panels, then set a search and filter on the *[Logs] Web Traffic* dashboard.

[float]
[[url-drilldowns]]
==== Create URL drilldowns

URL drilldowns enable you to navigate from a dashboard to external websites. Destination URLs can be dynamic, depending on the dashboard context or user interaction with a panel. To create URL drilldowns, you add <<variables,variables>> to a URL template, which configures the behavior of the drilldown. All panels that you create with the visualization editors support dashboard drilldowns.

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/dashboard_urlDrilldownGoToGitHub_8.3.gif[Drilldown on pie chart that navigates to Github]

Some panels support multiple interactions, also known as triggers. 
The <<url-template-variables,variables>> you use to create a <<url_templating-language, URL template>> depends on the trigger you choose. URL drilldowns support these types of triggers:

* *Single click* &mdash; A single data point in the panel.

* *Range selection* &mdash; A range of values in a panel.

For example, *Single click* has `{{event.value}}` and *Range selection* has `{{event.from}}` and `{{event.to}}`.

[float]
===== Create a URL drilldown

For example, if you have a dashboard that shows data from a Github repository, you can create a URL drilldown that opens Github from the dashboard panel.

. Add the <<gs-get-data-into-kibana,*Sample web logs*>> data.

. Open the *[Logs] Web Traffic* dashboard.

. In the toolbar, click *Edit*.

. Create a donut chart

.. Click *Create visualization*.

.. From the *Chart type* dropdown, select *Donut*.

.. From the *Available fields* list, drag *machine.os.keyword* to the workspace.

.. Click *Save and return*.

. Open the donut chart panel menu, then select *Create drilldown*.

. Click *Go to URL*.

.. Give the drilldown a name. For example, `Show on Github`.

.. For the *Trigger*, select *Single click*.

.. To navigate to the {kib} repository Github issues, enter the following in the *Enter URL* field:
+
[source, bash]
----
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+{{event.value}}
----
+
{kib} substitutes `{{event.value}}` with a value associated with the selected pie slice.

.. Click *Create drilldown*.

. Save the dashboard.

. On the donut chart panel, click any chart slice, then select *Show on Github*.
+

[float]
[[url_templating-language]]
==== URL templating

beta[]

The URL template input uses https://ela.st/handlebars-docs#expressions[Handlebars] — a simple templating language. Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions.

[source, bash]
----
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues?q={{event.value}}
----

A Handlebars expression is a `{{`, some contents, followed by a `}}`. When the drilldown is executed, these expressions are replaced by values from the dashboard and interaction context.

[[helpers]]
In addition to  https://ela.st/handlebars-helpers[built-in] Handlebars helpers, you can use custom helpers.

Refer to Handlebars https://ela.st/handlebars-docs#expressions[documentation] to learn about advanced use cases.

[float]
[[url-template-variables]]
===== URL template variables

The URL drilldown template has three sources for variables:

* *Global* static variables that don’t change depending on the  place where the URL drilldown is used or which user interaction executed the drilldown. For example: `{{kibanaUrl}}`.
* *Context* variables that change depending on where the drilldown is created and used. These variables are extracted from a context of a panel on a dashboard. For example, `{{context.panel.filters}}` gives access to filters that applied to the current panel.
* *Event* variables that depend on the trigger context. These variables are dynamically extracted from the interaction context when the drilldown is executed.

To ensure that the configured URL drilldown works as expected with your data, you have to save the dashboard and test in the panel.
You can access the full list of variables available for the current panel and selected trigger by clicking *Add variable* in the top-right corner of a URL template input.
