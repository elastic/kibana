dashboards and external websites.

Add interactive capabilities to your dashboard, such as controls that allow you to apply dashboard-level filters, and drilldowns that allow you to navigate to other dashboards and external websites. 

*Controls* panels allow you to apply dashboard-level filters based on values from a list, or a range of values. 

{kib} supports two types of *Controls*:

* *Options list* &mdash; Filters content based on one or more specified options. The dropdown menu is dynamically populated with the results of a terms aggregation. 
For example, use the options list on the sample flight dashboard when you want to filter the data by origin city and destination city.

* *Range slider* &mdash; Filters data within a specified range of numbers. The minimum and maximum values are dynamically populated with the results of a 
min and max aggregation. For example, use the range slider when you want to filter the sample flight dashboard by a specific average ticket price.

Panels have built-in interactive capabilities that apply filters to the dashboard data. For example, when you drag a time range or click a pie slice, a filter for the time range or pie slice is applied. Drilldowns let you customize the interactive behavior while keeping the context of the interaction. 

{kib} supports two types of drilldowns:

* *Dashboard* &mdash; Navigates you from one dashboard to another dashboard. For example, when can create a drilldown for a *Lens* panel that navigates you from a summary dashboard to a dashboard with a filter for a specific host name.

* *URL* &mdash; Navigates you from a dashboard to an external website. For example, a website with the specific host name as a parameter.

Third-party developers can create drilldowns. To learn how to code drilldowns, refer to {kib-repo}blob/{branch}/x-pack/examples/ui_actions_enhanced_examples[this example plugin].

[[add-controls]]
=== Add Controls panels

Add interactive dashboard-level filter panels to your dashboard.

. On the dashboard, click *All types*, then select *Controls*.

. Click *Options*, then configure the following options:

* *Update {kib} filters on each change* &mdash; When selected, all interactive inputs create filters that refresh the dashboard. When unselected,
 {kib} filters are created only when you click *Apply changes*.

* *Use time filter* &mdash; When selected, the aggregations that generate the options list and time range are connected to the <<set-time-filter,time filter>>.

* *Pin filters for all applications* &mdash; When selected, all filters created by interacting with the inputs are automatically pinned.

. Click *Update*

[[dashboard-drilldowns]]
=== Create dashboard drilldowns

Dashboard drilldowns enable you to open a dashboard from another dashboard, taking the time range, filters, and other parameters with you so the context remains the same. Dashboard drilldowns help you to continue your analysis from a new perspective.

For example, if you have a dashboard that shows the logs and metrics for multiple data centers, you can create a drilldown that navigates from the dashboard that shows multiple data centers, to a dashboard that shows a single data center or server.

The panels you create using the following editors support dashboard drilldowns:

* *Lens*
* *Maps*
* *TSVB*
* *Vega*
* *Aggregation-based* area chart, data table, heat map, horitizontal bar chart, line chart, pie chart, tag cloud, and vertical bar chart
* *Timelion*

==== Create and set up the dashboards you want to connect

Use the <<gs-get-data-into-kibana,*Sample web logs*>> data to create a dashboard and add panels, then set a search and filter on the *[Logs] Web traffic* dashboard.

. Add the *Sample web logs* data.

. Create a new dashboard, click *Add from Library*, then add the following panels:

* *[Logs] Heatmap*
* *[Logs] Host, Visits, and Bytes Table*
* *[Logs] Total Requests and Bytes*
* *[Logs] Visitors by OS*

. Set the <<set-time-filter,time filter>> to *Last 30 days*.

. Save the dashboard. In the *Title* field, enter `Host Overview`.

. Open the *[Logs] Web traffic* dashboard.

. Create a data table. 

.. In the toolbar, click *Edit*.

.. Click *Create visualization*.

.. From the *Chart type* dropdown, select *Table*.

.. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop the following fields onto the visualization builder:

* *agent.keyword*

* *bytes*

* *geo.src*

* *ip*

.. In the editor, remove *Count of records*, then click *Save and return*.

. On the *[Logs] Web traffic* dashboard, set a search and filter.
+
[%hardbreaks]
Search: `extension.keyword: ("gz" or "css" or "deb")`
Filter: `geo.src: CN`

[float]
==== Create the drilldown

Create a drilldown that opens the *Host Overview* dashboard from the *[Logs] Web traffic* dashboard.

. Open the panel menu for the data table you created, then select *Create drilldown*.

. Click *Go to dashboard*.

.. Give the drilldown a name. For example, `My Drilldown`.

.. From the *Choose a destination dashboard* dropdown, select *Host Overview*.

.. To use the geo.src filter, KQL query, and time filter, select *Use filters and query from origin dashboard* and *Use date range from origin dashboard*.

.. Click *Create drilldown*.

. Save the dashboard.

. In the data table panel, hover over a value, click *+*, then select `My Drilldown`.

[[url-drilldowns]]
=== Create URL drilldowns

URL drilldowns enable you to navigate from a dashboard to external websites. Destination URLs can be dynamic, depending on the dashboard context or user interaction with a panel. To create URL drilldowns, you add <<variables,variables>> to a URL template, which configures the behavior of the drilldown.

Some panels support multiple interactions, also known as triggers. 
The <<url-template-variables,variables>> you use to create a <<url_templating-language, URL template>> depends on the trigger you choose. URL drilldowns support these types of triggers:

* *Single click* &mdash; A single data point in the panel.

* *Range selection* &mdash; A range of values in a panel.

For example, *Single click* has `{{event.value}}` and *Range selection* has `{{event.from}}` and `{{event.to}}`.

The panels you create using the following editors support dashboard drilldowns:

* *Lens*
* *Maps*
* *TSVB*
* *Aggregation-based* area chart, data table, heat map, horitizontal bar chart, line chart, pie chart, tag cloud, and vertical bar chart

==== Create a URL drilldown

For example, if you have a dashboard that shows data from a Github repository, you can create a URL drilldown that opens Github from the dashboard panel.

. Add the *Sample web logs* data.

. Open the *[Logs] Web traffic* dashboard.

. In the toolbar, click *Edit*.

. Open the *[Logs] Visitors by OS* panel menu, then select *Create drilldown*.

. Click *Go to URL*.

.. Give the drilldown a name. For example, `Show on Github`.

.. For the *Trigger*, select *Single click*.

.. To navigate to the {kib} repository Github issues, enter the following in the *Enter URL* field:
+
[source, bash]
----
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+{{event.value}}
----
+
{kib} substitutes `{{event.value}}` with a value associated with the selected pie slice.

.. Click *Create drilldown*.

. Save the dashboard.

. On the *[Logs] Visitors by OS* panel, click any chart slice, then select *Show on Github*.
+

. In the list of {kib} repository issues, verify that the slice value appears.
