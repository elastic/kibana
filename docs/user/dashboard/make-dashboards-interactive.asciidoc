[[add-controls]]
=== experimental[] Add Controls panels

*Controls* panels allow you to apply dashboard-level filters based on values from a list, or a range of values. 

There are two types of *Controls* you can add to dashboards:

* *Options list* &mdash; Filters content based on one or more specified options. The dropdown menu is dynamically populated with the results of a terms aggregation. 
For example, use the options list on the sample flight dashboard when you want to filter the data by origin city and destination city.

* *Range slider* &mdash; Filters data within a specified range of numbers. The minimum and maximum values are dynamically populated with the results of a 
min and max aggregation. For example, use the range slider when you want to filter the sample flight dashboard by a specific average ticket price.

To create *Controls* panels:

. On the dashboard, click *All types*, then select *Controls*.

. Select the control panel type from the dropdown, then click *Add*.

. Enter the *Control Label*, then select the *{Data-Source}* and *Field*.

. If you are adding a *Range slider*, enter the *Step Size* and *Decimal Places*.

. Click *Options*, then configure the following:

* *Update {kib} filters on each change* &mdash; When selected, all interactive inputs create filters that refresh the dashboard. When unselected, {kib} filters are created only when you click *Apply changes*.

* *Use time filter* &mdash; When selected, the aggregations that generate the options list and time range are connected to the <<set-time-filter,time filter>>.

* *Pin filters for all applications* &mdash; When selected, all filters created by interacting with the inputs are automatically pinned.

. Click *Update*.

[[explore-the-underlying-documents]]
=== Open panel data in Discover

You can add interactions to panels that allow you to open and explore the data in *Discover*. To use the interactions, the panel must use only one {data-view}. 

There are three types of *Discover* interactions you can add to dashboards:

* *Panel interactions* &mdash; Opens panel data in *Discover*, including the dashboard-level filters, but not the panel-level filters.
+
To enable panel interactions, configure <<settings-explore-data-in-context,`xpack.discoverEnhanced.actions.`>> in kibana.yml. If you are using 7.13.0 and earlier, panel interactions are enabled by default.
+
To use panel interactions, open the panel menu, then click *Explore underlying data*.

* *Series data interactions* &mdash; Opens the series data in *Discover*.
+
To enable series data interactions, configure <<settings-explore-data-in-chart,`xpack.discoverEnhanced.actions.exploreDataInChart.enabled`>> in kibana.yml. If you are using 7.13.0 and earlier, data series interactions are enabled by default.
+
To use series data interactions, click a data series in the panel.

* *Saved search interactions* &mdash; Opens <<save-your-search,saved search>> data in *Discover*.
+
To use saved search interactions, open the panel menu, then click *More > View saved search*.

=== Create drilldowns

Panels have built-in interactive capabilities that apply filters to the dashboard data. For example, when you drag a time range or click a pie slice, a filter for the time range or pie slice is applied. Drilldowns let you customize the interactive behavior while keeping the context of the interaction. 

There are two types of drilldowns you can add to dashboards:

* *Dashboard* &mdash; Navigates you from one dashboard to another dashboard. For example, when can create a drilldown for a *Lens* panel that navigates you from a summary dashboard to a dashboard with a filter for a specific host name.

* *URL* &mdash; Navigates you from a dashboard to an external website. For example, a website with the specific host name as a parameter.

==== Create dashboard drilldowns

Dashboard drilldowns enable you to open a dashboard from another dashboard, taking the time range, filters, and other parameters with you so the context remains the same. Dashboard drilldowns help you to continue your analysis from a new perspective.

For example, if you have a dashboard that shows the logs and metrics for multiple data centers, you can create a drilldown that navigates from the dashboard that shows multiple data centers, to a dashboard that shows a single data center or server.

The panels you create using the following editors support dashboard drilldowns:

* *Lens*
* *Maps*
* *TSVB*
* *Vega*
* *Aggregation-based* area chart, data table, heat map, horitizontal bar chart, line chart, pie chart, tag cloud, and vertical bar chart
* *Timelion*

===== Create and set up the dashboards you want to connect

Use the <<gs-get-data-into-kibana,*Sample web logs*>> data to create a dashboard and add panels, then set a search and filter on the *[Logs] Web Traffic* dashboard.

. Add the *Sample web logs* data.

. Create a new dashboard, click *Add from Library*, then add the following panels:

* *[Logs] Response Codes Over Time + Annotations*
* *[Logs] Visits*

. Set the <<set-time-filter,time filter>> to *Last 30 days*.

. Save the dashboard. In the *Title* field, enter `Detailed logs`.

. Open the *[Logs] Web Traffic* dashboard, then set a search and filter.

==== Create URL drilldowns

URL drilldowns enable you to navigate from a dashboard to external websites. Destination URLs can be dynamic, depending on the dashboard context or user interaction with a panel. To create URL drilldowns, you add <<variables,variables>> to a URL template, which configures the behavior of the drilldown.

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/url_drilldown_go_to_github.gif[Drilldown on pie chart that navigates to Github]

Some panels support multiple interactions, also known as triggers. 
The <<url-template-variables,variables>> you use to create a <<url_templating-language, URL template>> depends on the trigger you choose. URL drilldowns support these types of triggers:

* *Single click* &mdash; A single data point in the panel.

* *Range selection* &mdash; A range of values in a panel.

For example, *Single click* has `{{event.value}}` and *Range selection* has `{{event.from}}` and `{{event.to}}`.

The panels you create using the following editors support dashboard drilldowns:

* *Lens*
* *Maps*
* *TSVB*
* *Aggregation-based* area chart, data table, heat map, horitizontal bar chart, line chart, pie chart, tag cloud, and vertical bar chart
