=== Aggregation-based

Aggregation-based visualizations are the core {kib} panels, and are not optimized
for a specific use case.

==== Types of aggregation-based visualizations

{kib} supports the following types of aggregation-based visualizations.

[cols="50, 50"]
|===

a| *Area*

Displays data points, connected by a line, where the area between the line and axes are shaded.
Use area charts to compare two or more categories over time, and display the magnitude of trends.

a| *Data table*

Displays your aggregation results in a tabular format. Use data tables to display server configuration details, track counts, min,
or max values for a specific field, and monitor the status of key services.

| image:images/data_table.png[Data table]

a| *Gauge*

Displays your data along a scale that changes color according to where your data falls on the expected scale. Use the gauge to show how metric
values relate to reference threshold values, or determine how a specified field is performing versus how it is expected to perform.

| image:images/gauge.png[Gauge]

a| *Goal*

Displays how your metric progresses toward a fixed goal. Use the goal to display an easy to read visual of the status of your goal progression.

| image:images/goal.png[Goal]

a| *Heat map*

Displays graphical representations of data where the individual values are represented by colors. Use heat maps when your data set includes
categorical data. For example, use a heat map to see the flights of origin countries compared to destination countries using the sample flight data.

a| *Horizontal Bar*

Displays bars side-by-side where each bar represents a category. Use bar charts to compare data across a
large number of categories, display data that includes categories with negative values, and easily identify
the categories that represent the highest and lowest values. {kib} also supports vertical bar charts.

a| *Line*

Displays data points that are connected by a line. Use line charts to visualize a sequence of values, discover
trends over time, and forecast future values.

| image:images/line.png[Line chart]

a| *Metric*

Displays a single numeric value for an aggregation. Use the metric visualization when you have a numeric value that is powerful enough to tell
a story about your data.

| image:images/metric.png[Metric]

a| *Pie*

Displays slices that represent a data category, where the slice size is proportional to the quantity it represents.
Use pie charts to show comparisons between multiple categories, illustrate the dominance of one category over others,
and show percentage or proportional data.

| image:images/pie.png[Pie chart]

a| *Tag cloud*

Graphical representations of how frequently a word appears in the source text. Use tag clouds to easily produce a summary of large documents and
create visual art for a specific topic.

==== Create an aggregation-based visualization panel

Choose the type of visualization you want to create, then use the editor to configure the options.

. On the dashboard, click *All types > Aggregation based*.

.. Select the visualization type you want to create.

.. Select the data source you want to visualize.

. Add the <<aggregation-reference,aggregations>> you want to visualize using the editor, then click *Update*. 
+
NOTE: For the *Date Histogram* to use an *auto interval*, the date field must match the primary time field of the index pattern.

. To change the order, drag and drop the aggregations in the editor.

==== Try it: Create an aggregation-based bar chart

You collected data from your web server, and you want to visualize and analyze the data on a dashboard. To create a dashboard panel of the data, create
a bar chart that displays the top five log traffic sources for every three hours.

[float]
===== Add the data and create the dashboard

Add the sample web logs data that you'll use to create the bar chart, then create the dashboard.

. From the *Home* page, click *Try our sample data*.

. From *Sample web logs*, click *Add data*.

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard*.

. On the *Dashboards* page, click *Create dashboard*.

[float]
===== Open and set up the aggregation-based bar chart

Open the bar chart visualization builder and change the time range. 

. On the dashboard, click *All types > Aggregation based*, select *Vertical bar*, then select *kibana_sample_data_logs*.

. Make sure the <<set-time-filter, time filter>>> is *Last 7 days*.

[[tutorial-configure-the-bar-chart]]
===== Create the bar chart

To create the bar chart, add a <<bucket-aggregations,bucket aggregation>>, then add the terms sub-aggregation to display the top values.

. Add a *Buckets* aggregation.

.. Click *Add*, then select *X-axis*.

.. From the *Aggregation* dropdown, select *Date Histogram*.

.. Click *Update*.

. To show the top five log traffic sources, add a sub-bucket aggregation.

.. Click *Add*, then select *Split series*.
+
TIP: Aggregation-based panels support a maximum of three *Split series*.

.. From the *Sub aggregation* dropdown, select *Terms*.

.. From the *Field* dropdown, select *geo.src*.

.. Click *Update*.
