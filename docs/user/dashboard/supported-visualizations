Metrics convey a clear understanding of how a specific indicator behaves. The primary goal is to display a number of the 
the most accurate, precise, and immediate value. 

Use metrics for the following quantitative data:

* Plain numbers
* Counts of elements, such as visitors and flights
* Percentages
* Formulas, such as sum and average

Add metrics to your dashboard to answer the following questions:

* How many visitors did we have?
* What's the current usage of CPU and Memory?
* How many flights have been delayed?

[[supported-visualizations-metric-best-practices]]
==== Metric best practices

To make metrics as clear as possible, use all the required components. 

Text and values should be self-explanatory and shouldn't require any prior contextual knowledge in order to be understood. Be specific without being verbose.

[image]

When the displayed value is the result of applied filters and does not reflect the current timeframe selected on your dashboard, 
remember to make this explicit. You can use subtitles or <other smaller text name> to clarify this and to inform the user of the choices 
and calculations that have been made prior. 

*Don'ts*
Don’t rely solely on <micro visualization functionality> or <background visualization functionality> to provide a precise and understandable analysis of data trends. 
These options give a contextual and wider layer of information that could help understanding the overall trends and evolution of data but they are not detailed enough 
to get specific insights. 

If your goal is to precisely see evolution of values over time please use a line chart instead, where you’ll have all the information required to perform a proper analysis 
(grid, values, axis, legend…)

[[supported-visualizations-metric-alternatives]]
==== Alternative metric visualizations

* *Bar chart* When many indicators/metrics share the same scale (e.g. percentage) it’s better to put them on the same chart in order to simplify the comparison among them

* *Table* Tables offer the possibility to sort and handle data in a more detailed manner. Use tables with conditional formatting to obtain a similar result but with more controls.

* *Text* Use plain text with a dedicated box when a long explanation is needed. Metric chart has limitations in terms of component size and length of text, instead of 
abounding with text, switch to a simpler component such a plain text.
