[[supported-visualizations-tabular]]
=== Tabular

Tabular visualizations organize your data into tables, which are highly customizable and allow you to align the text, format the values, apply different colors to cell and text values, and more. 

Use data tables to display the following quantitive and qualitative data:

* Text, such as names, geographic locations, and URLs
* Plain numbers, such as value amounts, percentages, and dates

Add tables to your dashboard to answer the following types of questions:

* How many visits did a webpage on my site receive compared to other webpages?
* What log errors did I receive over the last week?
* What was my revenue this week compared to last week?

==== Components of a data table

All data tables include the same set of components for visualizing your data.

| *3*
| *Column header* A name that describes the data that appears in the column.

| *4*
| *Row* Displays the qualitative field values and the associated qualitative field values.

| *5*

==== Data table best practices

To create data tables that best display your data, review the best practices. 

Priortize the data by ordering the columns by level of relevance. For example, by date.

==== Alternative data table visualizations

Consider the alertnative data table visualizations for best displaying your data. 

* *Line* To display a large amount of overview or summary data, use a line chart to easily view the changes and trends.

* *Bar* To compare many metrics over time, use a bar chart to easily compare the metrics.

[[supported-visualizations-bar]]
=== Bar

Bar charts, or bar graphs, display data in rectangular bars, where the height and length from the common baseline are proportional to the values the bars represent. 

{kib} supports the following bar charts:

* Bar horizontal
* Bar horizontal percentage
* Bar horizontal stacked
* Bar vertical
* Bar vertical percentage
* Bar vertical stacked

Stacked bar charts show how a larger category is divided into subcategories, where each subcategory is displayed in a different color. Depending on the data, the largest and most important, or least variable, subcategories are displayed along the baseline. Use stacked bar charts to display many fields. 

Grouped bar charts represent multiple data sets that are aligned and allow you to compare the data side-by-side. Use grouped bar charts when you want to compare individual bars to the associated group of bars, and each bar group across all grouped bars.

Use bar charts to visually compare the differences between categorical data, such as logs, host names, or days of the week, and for when you want to visually detect small changes in the values across categories. For example, add bar charts to your dashboard to answer the following types of questions:

* Which are the most frequent response types across my hosts?
* What are the top five hosts that produce the most error logs?
* What is the top selling product category?
* Are my network interface bandwidths used equally? Is the traffic more or less demanding on a specific interface?
* What deployed services use the most memory?
* How many hourly logs were ingested last week?

| *2*
| *Axis tick label* The labeled category or measurement that appears along the corresponding axis.

| *3*
| *Vertical axis* Displays a set of incremental ticks that guide analysis. In horizontal bar charts, represents the scale of a measured value, which is represented by the height of the bars. In vertical bar charts, represents categorical data.

| *4*
| *Bar* Increases from a common baseline where the height corresponds to the categorical data along the vertical axis. In a vertical bar chart, appears along the horizontal access.

| *5*
| *Baseline* The common base value for each bar, which is always zero. You can display bars above and below the baseline. 

| *6*
| *Horizontal axis* Displays a set of incremental ticks that guide analysis. In vertical bar charts, represents the categorical data. In a vertical bar chart, represents the scale of a measured value.

| *7*
| *Tick* A visually aligned and labeled category or measurement that appears along the corresponding axis.

[[supported-visualizations-bar-chart-best-practices]]
==== Bar chart best practices

To create bar charts that best display your data, review the best practices. 

To display long labels, such as IDs and host names, use horizontal bar charts.
+

To display a large number of categories or measurements, use vertical bar charts. Make sure to avoid reducing the size of the bars so the bars are easily readable. Before you reduce the bar size, consider increasing the chart size.

To display multiple data sets that show hierarchy, use a stacked bar chart and apply different colors to the sub categories. Make sure that you use five or less colors.  
+

When you create time-based bar charts, use proportions that best display the trends and changes in values over time.

[[supported-visualizations-bar-chart-alternatives]]
==== Alternative bar chart visualizations

Consider the alertnative bar chart visualizations for best displaying your data. 

* *Line* Use line charts when your data contains discrete, but ordinal, categories or intervals. For example, time ranges or age groups. Line charts are a better way to help you understand the trends across the set of ordinal categories, instead of only comparing the trends.

* *Pie* Use pie charts to display the data divided into categories, where the sum of the categories represents the whole. For example, the total number of logs divided by possible log types. Pie charts are a better way to help you understand how each category contributes to the whole.

[[supported-visualizations-goal-and-single-value]]
=== Goal and single value
Goal and single value visualizations convey a clear understanding of how a specific indicator behaves. The primary goal is to display a number of the the most accurate, precise, and immediate value. 

{kib} supports the following goal and single value visualizations:

* (Technical preview) Gauge horizontal 
* (Technical preview) Gauge vertical
* Legacy metric
* (Technical preview) Metric

Use goal and single value visualizations when you want to display the following quantitative data:

* Plain numbers
* Counts of elements, such as visitors and flights
* Percentages
* Formulas, such as sum and average

Add goal and single value visualizations to your dashboard to answer the following types of questions:

* How many visitors did we have?
* What's the current usage of CPU and Memory?
* How many flights have been delayed?

==== Alternative goal and single value visualizations

* *Bar chart* When your metric visualizations share the same scale, such as percentage, use a bar chart to easily compare side-by-side.

* *Table* Tables allow you to sort and format the data, but with additional options.

* *Text* When you need to describe visualizations in detail, use text.

//* *Line chart* Instead of using the background functionality to display how the data changes over time, use a line chart.
