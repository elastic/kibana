[[supported-visualizations-tabular]]
=== Tabular

Tabular visualizations organize your data in tables, which are highly customizable and allow you to align the text, format the values, apply different colors to cell and text values, and more.

Use tables to display the following quantitive and qualitative data:

* Text, such as names, geographic locations, and URLs
* Plain numbers, such as value amounts, percentages, and dates

Best practices:

* Priortize the data by ordering columns by level of relevance.
* Leave adequate spacing between columns and rows to make the table easy to read and the information easy to consume. 
* Add tables to your dashboard to answer the following questions:

** How many visits did a webpage on my site receive compared to other webpages?
** What log errors did I receive over the last week?
** What was my revenue this week compared to last week?

Alternative visualizations:

* *Line* To display a large amount of overview or summary data, a line chart is an effective way to digest the changes and trends.

* *Bar* To compare many metrics over time, display them on a bar chart to easily compare the metrics.

[[supported-visualizations-bar]]
=== Bar

Bar charts, or bar graphs, display data in rectangular bars, where the height and length from the common baseline are proportional to the values the bars represent. You can display bar charts vertically or horizontally, and if you have many fields, you can use stacked bar charts. 

In vertical bar charts, categories appear along the horizontal axis. In horizontal bar charts, categories appear along the vertical axis. 

Stacked bar charts show how a larger category is divided into subcategories, where each subcategory is displayed in a different color. Depending on the data, the largest and most important, or least variable subcategories are displayed along the baseline.

{kib} supports the following bar charts:

* Bar horizontal
* Bar horizontal percentage
* Bar horizontal stacked
* Bar vertical
* Bar vertical percentage
* Bar vertical stacked

Use bar charts to visually compare the differences between categorical data, such as logs, host names, or days of the week, and for when you want to visually detect small changes in the values across categories. For example, add bar charts to your dashboard to answer the following types of questions:

* Which are the most frequent response types across my hosts?
* What are the top five hosts that produce the most error logs?
* What is the top selling product category?
* Are my network interface bandwidths used equally? Is the traffic more or less demanding on a specific interface?
* What deployed services use the most memory?
* How many hourly logs were ingested last week?

[[components-of-a-bar-chart]]
==== Components of a bar chart

All bar charts include the same set of components for visualizing your data.

| *1*
| *Grid line* A visual indicator of the bar value. 

| *2*
| *Axis tick label* The labeled category or measurement that appears along the corresponding axis.

| *3*
| *Vertical axis* The quantitive axis that represents the scale of a measured value, which is represented by the height of the bars, and displays a set of incremental ticks to guide analysis. In a vertical bar chart, represents categorical data.

| *4*
| *Bar* Increases from a common baseline where the height corresponds to the categorical data along the vertical axis. In a vertical bar chart, appears along the horizontal access.

| *5*
| *Baseline* The common base value for each bar, which is always zero. You can display bars above and below the baseline. 

| *6*
| *Horizontal axis* The axis that represents the categorical data that appear as a set of incremental ticks to guide analysis. In a vertical bar chart, represents the scale of a measured value.

| *7*
| *Tick* A visually aligned and labeled category or measurement that appears along the corresponding axis.

[[supported-visualizations-bar-chart-best-practices]]
==== Bar chart best practices

To create bar charts that best display your data, review the best practices. 

To display long labels, such as IDs and host names, use horizontal bar charts.

To display a large number of categories or measurements, use vertical bar charts. Make sure to avoid reducing the size of the bars so the bars are easily readable. Before you reduce the bar size, consider increasing the chart size.

To display multiple data sets that show hierarchy, use a stacked bar chart and apply different colors to the sub categories. Make sure that you use five or less colors.

When you create time-based bar charts, use proportions that best display the trends and changes in values over time.

[[supported-visualizations-bar-chart-alternatives]]
==== Alternative bar chart visualizations

Consider the alertnative bar chart visualizations for best displaying your data. 

* *Line* Use line charts when your data contains discrete, but ordinal, categories or intervals. For example, time ranges or age groups. Line charts are a better way to help you understand the trends across the set of ordinal categories, instead of only comparing the trends.

* *Pie* Use pie charts to display the data divided into categories, where the sum of the categories represents the whole. For example, the total number of logs divided by possible log types. Pie charts are a better way to help you understand how each category contributes to the whole.

[[supported-visualizations-goal-and-single-value]]
=== Goal and single value

Metrics convey a clear understanding of how a specific indicator behaves. The primary goal is to display a number of the 
the most accurate, precise, and immediate value. 

Supported visualizations:

* (Technical preview) Gauge horizontal 
* (Technical preview) Gauge vertical
* Legacy metric
* (Technical preview) Metric

Use metrics for the following quantitative data:

* Plain numbers
* Counts of elements, such as visitors and flights
* Percentages
* Formulas, such as sum and average

Add metrics to your dashboard to answer the following questions:

* How many visitors did we have?
* What's the current usage of CPU and Memory?
* How many flights have been delayed?

[[supported-visualizations-metric-best-practices]]
==== Metric best practices

To make metrics as clear as possible, use all the required components. 

Text and values should be self-explanatory and shouldn't require any prior contextual knowledge in order to be understood. Be specific without being verbose.

[image]

When the displayed value is the result of applied filters and does not reflect the selected dashboard time range, 
remember to make this explicit. You can use subtitles or <other smaller text name> to inform users of the choices 
and calculations. 

*Don'ts*
Don’t rely solely on <micro visualization functionality> or <background visualization functionality> to provide a precise and understandable analysis of data trends. 
These options give a contextual and wider layer of information that could help understanding the overall trends and evolution of data but they are not detailed enough 
to get specific insights. 

If your goal is to precisely see evolution of values over time please use a line chart instead, where you’ll have all the information required to perform a proper analysis 
(grid, values, axis, legend…)

[[supported-visualizations-metric-alternatives]]
==== Alternative metric visualizations

* *Bar chart* When many indicators/metrics share the same scale (e.g. percentage) it’s better to put them on the same chart in order to simplify the comparison among them

* *Table* Tables offer the possibility to sort and handle data in a more detailed manner. Use tables with conditional formatting to obtain a similar result but with more controls.

* *Text* Use plain text with a dedicated box when a long explanation is needed. Metric chart has limitations in terms of component size and length of text, instead of 
abounding with text, switch to a simpler component such a plain text.
