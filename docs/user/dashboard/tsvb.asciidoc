complex summaries of that data.

. Select *Data*. If you are using *Table*, select *Columns*.
. From the *Aggregation* drop down, select the aggregation you want to visualize.

If you donâ€™t see any data, change the <<set-time-filter,time filter>>.
+
To add multiple aggregations, click *+*.
. From the *Group by* drop down, select how you want to group or split the data.
. To add another data set, click *+*.

When you have more than one aggregation, the last value is displayed, which is indicated by the eye icon.
