=== TSVB

*TSVB* enables you to visualize the data from multiple data series, supports <<aggregation-reference, 
most {es} metric aggregations>>, multiple visualization types, custom functions, and some math. 
To create *TSVB* visualization panels, your data must have a time field.

[[tsvb-required-choices]]
==== Open and set up TSVB

Open *TSVB*, then make sure the required settings are configured.

. On the dashboard, click *All types*, then select *TSVB*.

. In *TSVB*, click *Panel options*, then specify the required *Data* settings.

.. From the *Index pattern* dropdown, select the index pattern you want to visualize. 
+
To visualize an {es} index, open the *Index pattern select mode* menu, deselect *Use only {kib} index patterns*, then enter the {es} index.

.. From the *Time field* dropdown, select the field you want to visualize, then enter the field *Interval*.

.. Select a *Drop last bucket* option. 
+
By default, *TSVB* drops the last bucket because the time filter intersects the time range of the last bucket. To view the partial data, select *No*.

.. In the *Panel filter* field, enter <<kuery-query, KQL filters>> to view specific documents.

[[configure-the-data-series]]
==== Configure the series

Each *TSVB* visualization shares the same options to create a *Series*. Each series can be thought of as a separate {es} aggregation. 
For each series, the *Options* control the styling and {es} options, and are inherited from *Panel options*.
When you have separate options for each series, you can compare different {es} indices, and view two time ranges from the same index. 

To configure the value of each series, select the function, then configure the function inputs. Only the last function is displayed.

. From the *Aggregation* dropdown, select the function for the series. 

. To display each group separately, select one of the following options from the *Group by* dropdown:

* *Filters* &mdash; Groups the data into the specified filters. To differentiate the groups, assign a color to each filter.

* *Terms* &mdash; Displays the top values of the field. The color is only configurable in the *Time Series* chart. To configure, click *Options*, then select an option from the *Split color theme* dropdown.

. Click *Options*, then configure the inputs for the function.

==== TSVB visualization options

The configuration options differ for each *TSVB* visualization.

[float]
[[tsvb-time-series]]
===== Time Series

By default, the y-axis displays the full range of data, including zero. To automatically scale the y-axis from
the minimum to maximum values of the data, click *Data > Options > Fill*, then enter `0` in the *Fill* field.
You can add annotations to the x-axis based on timestamped documents in a separate {es} index.

[float]
[[all-chart-types-except-time-series]]
===== All chart types except Time Series

The *Data timerange mode* dropdown in *Panel options* controls the timespan that *TSVB* uses to match documents.
*Last value* is unable to match all documents, only the specific interval. *Entire timerange* matches all documents specified in the time filter.

[float]
[[metric-topn-gauge]]
===== Metric, Top N, and Gauge

*Color rules* in *Panel options* contains conditional coloring based on the values. 

[float]
[[topn-table]]
===== Top N and Table

When you click a series, *TSVB* applies a filter based on the series name. 
To change this behavior, click *Panel options*, then specify a URL in the *Item URL* field, which opens a URL instead of applying a filter on click. 

[float]
[[tsvb-markdown]]
===== Markdown

The *Markdown* visualization supports Markdown with Handlebar (mustache) syntax to insert dynamic data, and supports custom CSS using the LESS syntax.

[[tsvb-function-reference]]
==== TSVB function reference

*TSVB* provides you with shortcuts for some frequently-used functions.

*Filter Ratio*::
  Returns a percent value by calculating a metric on two sets of documents. 
  For example, calculate the error rate as a percentage of the overall events over time.

*Counter Rate*::
  Used when dealing with monotonically increasing counters. Shortcut for *Max*, *Derivative*, and *Positive Only*.

*Positive Only*::
  Removes any negative values from the results, which can be used as a post-processing step
  after a derivative.

*Series Agg*::
  Applies a function to all of the *Group by* series to reduce the values to a single number.
  This function must always be the last metric in the series.
  For example, if the *Time Series* visualization shows 10 series, the sum *Series Agg* calculates
  the sum of all 10 bars and output a single Y value per X value. This is often confused
  with the overall sum function, which outputs a single Y value per unique series.

*Math*::
  The math context is able to do simple and advanced calculations per series.
  This function must always be the last metric in the series.

==== Frequently asked questions

For answers to frequently asked *TSVB* question, review the following. 

[float]
===== Why is my TSVB visualization missing data?

It depends, but most often there are two causes:

* For *Time series* visualizations with a derivative function, the time interval can be too small. Derivatives require sequential values. 

* For all other *TSVB* visualizations, the cause is probably the *Data timerange mode*, which is controlled by *Panel options > Data timerange mode > Entire time range*.
By default, *TSVB* displays the last whole bucket. For example, if the time filter is set to *Last 24 hours*, and the
current time is 9:41, *TSVB* displays only the last 10 minutes &mdash; from 9:30 to 9:40.

[float]
===== How do I calculate the difference between two data series?

Performing math across data series is unsupported in *TSVB*. To calculate the difference between two data series, use <<timelion, *Timelion*>> or <<vega, *Vega*>>.

[float]
===== How do I compare the current versus previous month?

*TSVB* can display two series with time offsets, but it can't perform math across series. To add a time offset:

. Click *Clone Series*, then choose a color for the new series.
+

. Click *Options*, then enter the offset value in the *Offset series time by* field.

[float]
===== How do I calculate a month over month change?
  
The ability to calculate a month over month change is not fully supported in *TSVB*, but there is a special case that is supported _if_ the
time filter is set to 3 months or more _and_ the *Interval* is `1m`. Use the *Derivative* to get the absolute monthly change. To convert to a percent, 
add the *Math* function with the `params.current / (params.current - params.derivative)` formula, then select *Percent* from the *Data Formatter* dropdown.

For other types of month over month calculations, use <<timelion, *Timelion*>> or <<vega, *Vega*>>.

[float]
===== How do I calculate the duration between the start and end of an event?
  
Calculating the duration between the start and end of an event is unsupported in *TSVB* because *TSVB* requires correlation between different time periods. 
*TSVB* requires that the duration is pre-calculated.
