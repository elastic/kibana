[[create-dashboards]]
= Build dashboards

{kib} offers many ways to build powerful dashboards that will help you visualize and keep track of the most important information contained in your {es} data.

* Create and assemble visualizations such as charts or maps, and enrich them with helpful legends containing key data.
* Extract and show key indicators and metrics to keep them visible and highlighted at all times.
* Add text, images, and links to help viewers make the most of your dashboard.
* Include additional controls to facilitate filtering and browsing the data.

[[dashboard-minimum-requirements]]

To create or edit dashboards, you first need to:

* have {ref}/getting-started-index.html[data indexed into {es}] and a <<data-views, data view>>. A data view is a subset of your {es} data, and allows you to load just the right data when building a visualization or exploring it. 
+
TIP: If you don't have data at hand and still want to explore dashboards, you can import one of the <<sample-data,sample data sets>> available.

* have sufficient permissions on the **Dashboard** feature. If that's not the case, you might get a read-only indicator. A {kib} administrator can <<kibana-privileges,grant you the required privileges>>.

[[arrange-panels]]
== Organize dashboard panels

[[collapsible-sections]]
=== Arrange panels in collapsible sections

Organize your dashboard panels into collapsible sections to improve readability and navigation, especially for dashboards with many panels. Collapsible sections also help dashboards load faster by only loading the content from expanded sections.

To add a collapsible section:

. Open the dashboard and make sure that you are in **Edit** mode.

. Select **Add panel** and select **Collapsible section**. The collapsible section is added at the end of the dashboard.

. Just like any other panel, you can drag an drop the collapsible section to a different position in the dashboard.

Users viewing the dashboard will find the section in the same state as when you saved the dashboard. If you saved it with the section collapsed, then it will also be collapsed by default for users.

== Import dashboards

You can import dashboards from the **Saved Objects** page under **Stack Management**. Refer to <<managing-saved-objects,Manage saved objects>>.

When importing dashboards, you also import their related objects, such as data views and visualizations. Import options allow you to define how the import should behave with these related objects.

* **Check for existing objects**: When selected, objects are not imported when another object with the same ID already exists in this space or cluster. For example, if you import a dashboard that uses a data view which already exists, the data view is not imported and the dashboard uses the existing data view instead. You can also chose to select manually which of the imported or the existing objects are kept by selecting **Request action on conflict**.

* **Create new objects with random IDs**: All related objects are imported and are assigned a new ID to avoid conflicts.
