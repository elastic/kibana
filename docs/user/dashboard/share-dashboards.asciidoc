== Share dashboards

[[embedding-dashboards]]
Share your dashboard outside of {kib}.

From the *Share* menu, you can:

* Embed the code in a web page. Users must have {kib} access
to view an embedded dashboard.
* Share a direct link to a {kib} dashboard
* Generate a PDF report
* Generate a PNG report

TIP: To create a link to a dashboard by title, use: +
`${domain}/${basepath?}/app/dashboards#/list?title=${yourdashboardtitle}`

TIP: When sharing a link to a dashboard snapshot, use the *Short URL*. Snapshot
URLs are long and can be problematic for Internet Explorer and other
tools. To create a short URL, you must have write access to {kib}.
