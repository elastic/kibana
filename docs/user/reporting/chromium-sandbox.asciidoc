=== Chromium sandbox

When {reporting} uses the Chromium browser for generating PDF reports, it's recommended to use the sandbox for
an additional layer of security. The Chromium sandbox uses operating system provided mechanisms to ensure that
code execution cannot make persistent changes to the computer or access confidential information. The specific
sandboxing techniques differ for each operating system.

==== Linux sandbox
The Linux sandbox depends on user namespaces, which were introduced with the 3.8 Linux kernel. However, many
distributions don't have user namespaces enabled by default, or they require the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability. {reporting}
will automatically disable the sandbox when it is running on Debian and CentOS as additional steps are required to enable
unprivileged usernamespaces. In these situations, you'll see the following message in your {kib} startup logs:
`Chromium sandbox provides an additional layer of protection, but is not supported for your OS.
Automatically setting 'xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.disableSandbox: true'.`

Reporting will automatically enable the Chromium sandbox at startup when a supported OS is detected. However, if your kernel is 3.8 or newer, it's
recommended to set `xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.disableSandbox: false` in your `kibana.yml` to explicitly enable usernamespaces.

==== Docker
When running {kib} in a Docker container, all container processes are run within a usernamespace with seccomp-bpf and
AppArmor profiles that prevent the Chromium sandbox from being used. In these situations, disabling the sandbox is recommended,
as the container implements similar security mechanisms.
