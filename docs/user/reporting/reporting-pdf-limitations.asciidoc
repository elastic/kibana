We recommend using PNG/PDF reports to export moderate amounts of data only. The feature enables a high-level
export capability, but it's not intended for bulk export. If you need to export several pages of image data,
consider using multiple report jobs to export a small number of pages at a time. If the screenshot of exported
dashboard contains a large number of pixels, consider splitting the large dashboard into smaller artifacts to
use less memory and CPU resources.

For the most reliable configuration of PDF/PNG {report-features}, consider installing {kib} using <<docker,Docker>> or using <<set-up-on-cloud,Elastic Cloud>>.
