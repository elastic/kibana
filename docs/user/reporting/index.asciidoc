= Reporting from Kibana

[partintro]

--

You can generate reports that contain {kib} dashboards,
visualizations, and saved searches. Dashboards and visualizations are
exported as PDF documents, while saved searches in Discover
are exported to CSV.

Reporting is located in the share menu from the {kib} toolbar:

== System setup

{reporting} is automatically enabled in {kib}. The first time {kib} runs, it extracts a custom build for the Chromium web browser, which
runs on the server in headless mode to load {kib} and capture the rendered {kib} charts as images.

Chromium is an open-source project not related to Elastic, but the Chromium binary for {kib} has been custom-built by Elastic to ensure it
works with minimal setup. However, the {kib} server OS might still require additional dependencies for Chromium. See the
<<reporting-troubleshooting-system-dependencies, Reporting Troubleshooting>> section for more information about the system dependencies
for different operating systems.

== Manually generate reports

. Open {kib} in your web browser and log in. If you are running {kib}
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601`. To access {kib} and generate
reports, you need the `kibana_user` and `reporting_user` roles. For more
information, see <<secure-reporting>>.

. Open the dashboard, visualization, or saved search you want to include
in the report.

. Click *Share* in the {kib} toolbar:

. Depending on the {kib} application, choose the appropriate options:

. If you're on Discover, select *CSV Reports*, then click *Generate CSV*.

. If you're on Visualize or Dashboard:

.. Select *PDF Reports*

.. Dashboard only: Choose to enable *Optimize for printing* layout mode. For an explanation of the different layout modes, see <<pdf-layout-modes, PDF Layout Modes>>.

.. Click *Generate PDF*.
