[[manually-generate-reports]]
== Create reports

Create and download PDF, PNG, or CSV reports of saved searches, dashboards, visualizations, and workpads.

[[reporting-layout-sizing]]
The layout and size of the report depends on what you are sharing.
For saved searches, dashboards, and visualizations, the layout depends on the size of the panels.
For workpads, the layout depends on the size of the worksheet dimensions.

To change the output size, change the size of the browser, which resizes the shareable container before the report generates. It might take some trial and error before you're satisfied.

In the following dashboard, the shareable container is highlighted:

[role="screenshot"]

. Open the main menu, then open the saved search, dashboard, visualization, or workpad you want to share.

. From the toolbar, click *Share*, then select one of the following options:

** **PDF Reports** &mdash; Generates a PDF file of the dashboard, visualization, or workpad.

** **PNG Reports** &mdash; Generates a PNG file of the dashboard or visualization.

** **CSV Reports** &mdash; Generates a CSV report of the saved search.

. If you are creating a PDF report of a dashboard, select *Optimize for printing* to create a printer-friendly PDF with multiple A4 portrait pages and two visualizations per page.
+
NOTE: When you create a dashboard report that includes a data table or saved search, the PDF includes only the visible data.

. If you are creating a PDF report of a workpad, select *Full page layout* to create a PDF without margins that surround the workpad.

. Generate the report.

. When the report generates, a message appears. On the message, click **Download report**.

. To view and manage reports, open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Reporting*.

NOTE: Reports are stored in {es} and managed by the `kibana-reporting` {ilm}
({ilm-init}) policy. By default, the policy stores reports forever. To learn
more about {ilm-init} policies, refer to the {es}
{ref}/index-lifecycle-management.html[{ilm-init} documentation].

[[add-workpad-website]]
== Share workpads on a website

beta[] *Canvas* allows you to create _shareables_, which are workpads that you download and securely share on a website.
To customize the behavior of the workpad on your website, you can choose to autoplay the pages or hide the workpad toolbar.

. Open the main menu, then click *Canvas*.

. Open the workpad you want to share.

. Click *Share > Share on a website*.

. Follow the instructions.

. To customize the workpad behavior to autoplay the pages or hide the toolbar, use the inline parameters.
+
To make sure that your data remains secure, the data in the JSON file is not connected to {kib}. *Canvas* does not display elements that manipulate the data on the workpad.
+
NOTE: Shareable workpads encode the current state of the workpad in a JSON file. When you make changes to the workpad, the changes do not appear in the shareable workpad on your website.

. To change the settings, click the settings icon, then choose the settings you want to use.
