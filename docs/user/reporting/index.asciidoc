[[manually-generate-reports]]
== Create reports

Create and download reports of your *Discover* saved searches, dashboards, *Visualize Library* visualizations, and *Canvas* workpads.

[[reporting-layout-sizing]]
The layout and size of the report depends on the *Discover* saved searches, dashboards, visualizations, and *Canvas* workpads. 
For *Discover* saved searches, dashboards, and visualizations, the layout depends on the size of the panels.
For *Canvas* workpads, the layout depends on the size of the worksheet dimensions. 

To make the report output larger or smaller, change the size of the browser, which resizes the shareable container before the report generates. It might take some trial and error before you're satisfied with the layout and dimensions.

In the following dashboard, the shareable container is highlighted:
