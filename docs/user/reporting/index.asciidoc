--

You can generate a report that contains a {kib} dashboard, visualization, 
saved search, or Canvas workpad.  You can create the report on demand, 
schedule it for later, or trigger a report based on specified conditions. 
You can keep the report for yourself, or automatically share it with others via email.

Reporting is located in the *Share* menu 
in *Discover*, *Visualize*, *Dashboard*, and *Canvas*.

== System setup

{reporting} is automatically enabled in {kib}. The first time {kib} runs, it extracts a custom build for the Chromium web browser, which
runs on the server in headless mode to load {kib} and capture the rendered {kib} charts as images.

Chromium is an open-source project not related to Elastic, but the Chromium binary for {kib} has been custom-built by Elastic to ensure it
works with minimal setup. However, the {kib} server OS might still require additional dependencies for Chromium. See the
<<reporting-troubleshooting-system-dependencies, Reporting troubleshooting>> section for more information about the system dependencies
for different operating systems.

[[reporting-required-privileges]]
== Required privileges

To generate a report, you need the following:

* The `reporting_user` role.
* The appropriate <<kibana-privileges, {kib} privileges>> to access the objects that you
want to report on.
* Access to the {es} indices with the underlying data.

[[manually-generate-reports]]
== Generate a report manually

. Open the dashboard, visualization, Canvas workpad, or saved search that you want to include in the report. 

. In the toolbar, click *Share*.  If in Canvas, 
click the share icon image:user/reporting/images/canvas-share-button.png["Canvas Share button"].

You can export a dashboard or visualization as either a PNG or PDF document, 
a Canvas workspad as a PDF document, and a saved search as a CSV document.

. Generate the report.

A notification appears when the report is complete.

[[optimize-pdf]]
== Optimize PDF for print&mdash;dashboard only

By default, {kib} creates a PDF  
using the existing layout and size of the dashboard. To create a 
print-friendly PDF with multiple A4 portrait pages and two visualizations 
per page, turn on *Optimize for printing*.
