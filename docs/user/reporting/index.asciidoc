{kib} provides you with several options to share *Discover* saved searches, dashboards, *Visualize Library* visualizations, and *Canvas* workpads. These sharing options are available from the *Share* menu in the toolbar.

[[share-a-direct-link]]
== Share with a direct link

You can share direct links to saved searches, dashboards, and visualizations. When clicking **Share**, look for the **Links** tab to get the shareable link and copy it. 

TIP: When sharing an object with unsaved changes, you get a temporary link that might break in the future, for example in case of upgrade. Save the object to get a permanent link instead.

To access the object shared with the link, users need to authenticate.

Anonymous users can also access the link if you have configured <<anonymous-authentication,Anonymous authentication>> and your anonymous service account has privileges to access what you want to share.

== Export as a file

NOTE: For more information on how to configure reporting in {kib}, refer to <<secure-reporting,Configure reporting in {kib}>>

Create and download PDF, PNG, or CSV reports of saved searches, dashboards, visualizations, and workpads.

* *PDF* &mdash; Generate and download PDF files of dashboards, visualizations, and *Canvas* workpads. PDF reports are a link:https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription feature].

* *PNG* &mdash; Generate and download PNG files of dashboards and visualizations. PNG reports are a link:https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription feature].

* *CSV Reports* &mdash; Generate CSV reports of saved searches. <<csv-limitations,Certain limitations apply>>.

* *CSV Download* &mdash; Generate and download CSV files of *Lens* visualizations.

* *Download as JSON* &mdash; Generate and download JSON files of *Canvas* workpads.


[[reporting-layout-sizing]]
The layout and size of the report depends on what you are sharing.
For saved searches, dashboards, and visualizations, the layout depends on the size of the panels.
For workpads, the layout depends on the size of the worksheet dimensions.

To change the output size, change the size of the browser, which resizes the shareable container before the report generates. It might take some trial and error before you're satisfied.

In the following dashboard, the shareable container is highlighted:

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/reporting/images/shareable-container.png["Shareable Container"]

. Open the saved search, dashboard, visualization, or workpad you want to share.

. From the toolbar, click *Share*, then select the report option. 

* If you are creating dashboard PDFs, select *For printing* to create printer-friendly PDFs with multiple A4 portrait pages and two visualizations per page.
+
NOTE: When you create a dashboard report that includes a data table or saved search, the PDF includes only the visible data.

* If you are creating workpad PDFs, select *Full page layout* to create PDFs without margins that surround the workpad.

. Generate the report by clicking **Export file**, **Generate CSV**, or **Generate PDF**, depending on the object you want to export.
+
NOTE: You can use the *Copy POST URL* option instead to generate the report from outside Kibana or from Watcher.

. A message appears, indicating that the report is in the export queue. 

You can then download it from that message, or go to the *Stack Management > Reporting* page to view and access all of your reports.

NOTE: In self-managed and Cloud hosted deployments, reports are stored in {es} and managed by the `kibana-reporting` {ilm}
({ilm-init}) policy. By default, the policy stores reports forever. To learn more about {ilm-init} policies, refer
to the {es} {ref}/index-lifecycle-management.html[{ilm-init} documentation].

[[add-workpad-website]]
== Share workpads on a website

+
NOTE: Shareable workpads encode the current state of the workpad in a JSON file. When you make changes to the workpad, the changes do not appear in the shareable workpad on your website.

. To change the settings, click the settings icon, then choose the settings you want to use.
