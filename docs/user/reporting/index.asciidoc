[[reporting-on-cloud-resource-requirements]]
NOTE: For Elastic Cloud deployments, {kib} instances require a minimum of 2GB RAM to generate PDF or PNG reports. To

[[manually-generate-reports]]
== Create reports

Create and download PDF, PNG, or CSV reports of saved searches, dashboards, visualizations, and workpads.

[[reporting-layout-sizing]]
The layout and size of the report depends on what you are sharing.
For saved searches, dashboards, and visualizations, the layout depends on the size of the panels.
For workpads, the layout depends on the size of the worksheet dimensions.

To change the output size, change the size of the browser, which resizes the shareable container before the report generates. It might take some trial and error before you're satisfied.

In the following dashboard, the shareable container is highlighted:

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/reporting/images/shareable-container.png["Shareable Container"]

. Open the main menu, then open the saved search, dashboard, visualization, or workpad you want to share.

. From the toolbar, click *Share*, then select the report option. 

* If you are creating dashboard PDFs, select *Optimize for printing* to create printer-friendly PDFs with multiple A4 portrait pages and two visualizations per page.
+
NOTE: When you create a dashboard report that includes a data table or saved search, the PDF includes only the visible data.

* If you are creating workpad PDFs, select *Full page layout* to create PDFs without margins that surround the workpad.

. Generate the report.

. When the report generates, a message appears. On the message, click **Download report**.

. To view and manage reports, open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Reporting*.

NOTE: In "stateful" deployments, reports are stored in {es} and managed by the `kibana-reporting` {ilm}
({ilm-init}) policy. By default, the policy stores reports forever. To learn more about {ilm-init} policies, refer
to the {es} {ref}/index-lifecycle-management.html[{ilm-init} documentation].
