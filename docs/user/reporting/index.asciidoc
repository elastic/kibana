Generate reports of your dashboards, visualizations,
*Discover* saved searches, and *Canvas* workpads. Depending on the object type, you can export the data as
a PDF, PNG, or CSV document, which you can keep for yourself, or share with others.

The reporting options are available from the *Share* menu
in *Discover*, *Dashboard*, *Visualize Library*, and *Canvas*.

[[reporting-layout-sizing]]
== Layout and sizing
The layout and size of the PDF or PNG image depends on the {kib} app
with which the Reporting plugin is integrated. For *Canvas*, the
worksheet dimensions determine the size for reports. In other apps,
the dimensions are taken on the fly by looking at
the size of the visualization elements or panels on the page.

The size dimensions are part of the reporting job parameters. Therefore, to
make the report output larger or smaller, you can change the size of the browser.
This resizes the shareable container before generating the
report, so the desired dimensions are passed in the job parameters.

In the following {kib} dashboard, the shareable container is highlighted.
The shareable container is captured when you click
*Generate* or *Copy POST URL* from the *Share* menu. It might take some trial and error
before you're satisfied with the layout and dimensions in the
PNG or PDF image.
