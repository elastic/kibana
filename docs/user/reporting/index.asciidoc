--

You can generate a report that contains a {kib} dashboard, visualization,
saved search, or Canvas workpad. Depending on the object type, you can export the data as
a PDF, PNG, or CSV document, which you can keep for yourself, or share with others.

Reporting is available from the *Share* menu
in *Discover*, *Dashboard*, *Visualize Library*, and *Canvas*.

== Setup

The {report-features} are automatically enabled in {kib}. It runs a custom build of the Chromium web browser, which
runs on the server in headless mode to load {kib} and capture the rendered {kib} charts as images.

Chromium is an open-source project not related to Elastic, but the Chromium binary for {kib} has been custom-built by Elastic to ensure it
works with minimal setup. However, the {kib} server OS might still require additional dependencies for Chromium. See the
<<reporting-troubleshooting-system-dependencies, Reporting troubleshooting>> section for more information about the system dependencies
for different operating systems.

[[reporting-required-privileges]]
== Roles and privileges

When security is enabled, access to the {report-features} is controlled by security privileges. In versions 7.12 and earlier, you can grant access to the {report-features}
by assigning users the `reporting_user` role in {es}. In 7.13 and later, you can configure *Reporting* to use
<<kibana-privileges, {kib} privileges>>. It is recommended that *Reporting* is configured to
use {kib} privileges by setting <<xpack-reporting-roles-enabled,`xpack.reporting.roles.enabled`>> to `false`. By using {kib} privileges, you can define
custom roles that grant *Reporting* privileges as sub-features of {kib} applications in *Role Management*.

Users must also have the {kib} privileges to access the saved objects and associated {es} indices included in the generated reports.
For an example, refer to <<secure-reporting, Reporting and
security>>.

[[manually-generate-reports]]
== Manually generate and download reports

Generate and download PDF, PNG, and CSV files of dashboards, visualizations, **Canvas** workpads, and saved searches.

. Open theÂ dashboard, visualization, **Canvas** workpad, or saved search.

. From the {kib} toolbar, click **Share**, then select one of the following options:

** **PDF Reports** &mdash; Generates a PDF file of the dashboard, visualization, or **Canvas** workpad.
** **PNG Reports** &mdash; Generates a PNG file of the dashboard or visualization.
** **CSV Reports** &mdash; Generates a CSV report of the saved search.

. Generate the report.
+
When the report completes, a notification appears.

. Click **Download report**.

NOTE: When you create a dashboard report that includes a data table or saved search, the PDF includes only the visible data.

[[reporting-layout-sizing]]
== Layout and sizing
The layout and size of the PDF or PNG image depends on the {kib} app
with which the Reporting plugin is integrated. For *Canvas*, the
worksheet dimensions determine the size for reports. In other apps,
the dimensions are taken on the fly by looking at
the size of the visualization elements or panels on the page.

The size dimensions are part of the reporting job parameters. Therefore, to
make the report output larger or smaller, you can change the size of the browser.
This resizes the shareable container before generating the
report, so the desired dimensions are passed in the job parameters.

In the following {kib} dashboard, the shareable container is highlighted.
The shareable container is captured when you click
*Generate* or *Copy POST URL* from the *Share* menu. It might take some trial and error
before you're satisfied with the layout and dimensions in the
PNG or PDF image.
