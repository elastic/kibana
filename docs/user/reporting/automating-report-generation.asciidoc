== Deprecated report URLs

The following POST URL paths were once supported but are now deprecated. If there are
any problems with using these paths after upgrading {kib}, use
{kib} to regenerate the POST URL for a particular report.

* Dashboard Reports:  `/api/reporting/generate/dashboard/<dashboard-id>`
* Visualization Reports:  `/api/reporting/generate/visualization/<visualization-id>`
* Saved Search Reports: `/api/reporting/generate/search/<saved-search-id>`

[IMPORTANT]
===================
Previously there was a `&sync` parameter appended to generation URLs which would hold
the request open until the document was fully generated. This feature has been removed.
Existing use of the `&sync` parameter, in Watcher for example, will need to be updated.
