To automatically generate PDF and CSV reports, generate a POST URL, then submit the HTTP `POST` request using {watcher} or a script.

. From the toolbar, click *Share > PDF Reports*, then choose an option:

* If you are using *Dashboard* or *Visulize Library*, click *Copy POST URL*.

* If you are using *Canvas*, click *Advanced options > Copy POST URL*.

[[deprecated-report-urls]]
=== Deprecated report URLs

If you experience issues with the deprecated report URLs after you upgrade {kib}, regenerate the POST URL for your reports.

* *Dashboard* reports:  `/api/reporting/generate/dashboard/<dashboard-id>`
* *Visualize Library* reports:  `/api/reporting/generate/visualization/<visualization-id>`
* *Discover* saved search reports: `/api/reporting/generate/search/<saved-search-id>`

IMPORTANT:
In earlier {kib} versions, you could use the `&sync` parameter to append to report URLs that held the request open until the document was fully generated. The `&sync` parameter is now unsupported. If you use the `&sync` parameter in Watcher, you must update the parameter.
