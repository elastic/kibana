== Automating Report Generation
You can automatically generate reports with {watcher}, or by submitting
HTTP POST requests from a script.

To automatically generate reports with a watch, you need to configure
{watcher} to trust the {kib} serverâ€™s certificate. For more information,
see <<securing-reporting, Securing Reporting>>.

To get the URL for triggering a report generation during a given time period:

. Load the saved object.
. Use the timepicker to specify a relative or absolute time period.
. Click *Share* in the Kibana toolbar.
. Select *PDF Reports*.
. Click **Copy POST URL**.

NOTE: The response from this request with be JSON, and will contain a `path` property
with a URL to use to download the generated report. When requesting that path,
you will get a 503 response if it's not completed yet. In this case, retry after the
number of seconds in the `Retry-After` header in the response until the PDF is returned.

To configure a watch to email reports, you use the `reporting` attachment type
in an `email` action. For more information, see
{stack-ov}/actions-email.html#configuring-email[Configuring Email Accounts].

== Deprecated Report URLs

The following is deprecated in 6.0, and you should now use {kib} to get the URL for a
particular report.

You may request PDF reports optimized for printing through three {reporting} endpoints:

* Dashboard Reports:  `/api/reporting/generate/dashboard/<dashboard-id>`
* Visualization Reports:  `/api/reporting/generate/visualization/<visualization-id>`
* Saved Search Reports: `/api/reporting/generate/search/<saved-search-id>`

[IMPORTANT]
===================
Previously there was a `&sync` parameter appended to generation URLs which would hold
the request open until the document was fully generated. This feature has been removed.
Existing use of the `&sync` parameter, in Watcher for example, will need to be updated.
===================

To specify the time period you want to include in the report, you use the `_g`
parameter in the request. For example:

[source,shell]
---------------------------------------------------------
http://0.0.0.0:5601/api/reporting/generate/dashboard/error-monitoring?_g=(time:(from:now-1d%2Fd,mode:quick,to:now-1d%2Fd))
