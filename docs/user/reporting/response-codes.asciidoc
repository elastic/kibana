The reporting APIs use HTTP response codes to give feedback. In automation,
this helps external systems track the various possible job states:

- **`200` (OK)**: As expected, Kibana returns `200` status in the response for
  successful requests to queue or download reports.
+
NOTE: Kibana will send a `200` response status for successfully queuing a Reporting job via
the POST URL. This is true even if the job somehow fails later, since report
generation happens asynchronously from queuing.

- **`400` (Bad Request)**: When sending requests to the POST URL, if you don't use
  `POST` as the HTTP method, or if your request is missing the `kbn-xsrf` header,
  Kibana will return a code `400` status response for the request.

- **`503` (Service Unavailable)**: When using the `path` to request the download, you
  will get a `503` status response if report generation hasn't completed yet. The
  response will include a `Retry-After` header. You can set the script to wait the
  number of seconds in the `Retry-After` header, and then repeat if needed, until the
  report is complete.

- **`500` (Internal Server Error)**: When using the `path` to request the download, you
  will get a `500` status response if the report isn't available due to an error when
  generating the report. More information is available at **Management > Kibana > Reporting**.
