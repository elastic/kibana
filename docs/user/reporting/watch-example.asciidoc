To automatically generate reports with a watch, you need to configure
{watcher} to trust the {kib} serverâ€™s certificate. For more information,
see {kibana-ref}/secure-reporting.html[Securing Reporting].

To configure a watch to email reports, you use the `reporting` attachment type
in an `email` action. For more information, see
{stack-ov}/actions-email.html#configuring-email[Configuring Email Accounts].

For example, the following watch generates a PDF report and emails the report every hour:

[source,js]
---------------------------------------------------------
PUT _watcher/watch/error_report
{
  "trigger" : {
    "schedule": {
      "interval": "1h"
    }
  },
  "actions" : {
    "email_admin" : { <1>
      "email": {
        "to": "'Recipient Name <recipient@example.com>'",
        "subject": "Error Monitoring Report",
        "attachments" : {
          "error_report.pdf" : {
            "reporting" : {
              "url": "http://0.0.0.0:5601/api/reporting/generate/printablePdf?jobParams=...", <2>
              "retries":6, <3>
              "interval":"1s", <4>
              "auth":{ <5>
                "basic":{
                  "username":"elastic",
                  "password":"changeme"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
