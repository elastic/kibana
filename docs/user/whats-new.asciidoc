[float]
=== Discover

[float]
==== Document Explorer on by default

*Document Explorer*, the powerful new way to analyze and explore your data with *Discover*,
is now on by default. *Document Explorer* helps you quickly sort, select, and compare data,
resize columns, and view documents in fullscreen. For more information,
check {kibana-ref}/document-explorer.html[Explore your documents].

[float]
=== Visualization editors

[float]
==== Auto-apply your changes in Lens

By default, *Lens* has always automatically applied the changes you make to visualizations.
Now you can control when *Lens* applies your changes and generates suggestions with
the new ability to turn on and off auto-apply. To start manually applying your changes,
click *Settings* in the toolbar, then deselect *Auto-apply visualization changes*.
For more information, check {kibana-ref}/lens.html#create-the-visualization-panel[Create visualizations].

[float]
==== Add annotations to Lens visualizations (technical preview)

To call out significant changes and trends in your data, you can now add annotations
to *Lens* visualizations. Customize the appearance of annotations with text,
icons, colors, and more. For more information, check {kibana-ref}/lens.html#add-annotations[Add annotations].

[float]
==== Open TSVB visualizations in Lens

Open and edit your Time Series *TSVB* visualizations in *Lens*,
the drag-and-drop visualization editor that provides you with additional
visualization types, reference lines, and more.
For more information, check {kibana-ref}/tsvb.html#edit-visualizations-in-lens[Edit visualizations in Lens].

[float]
==== Explore Lens visualization data in Discover

For further exploration of your data, you can now open *Lens* visualization data
in *Discover*. With *Discover* you can view the documents in the fields you used
to create the visualization, then navigate back to *Lens* to finish creating your
visualization. For more information,
check {kibana-ref}/lens.html#explore-lens-data-in-discover[Explore the data in Discover].

[float]
==== Enhancements to visualization editors

{kib} now offers even more ways to create visualizations:

* **Metric visualization.** Use the new Metric visualization type in **Lens**
to show the latest or earliest data, or the last value.

* **Group by multiple fields in TSVB.** When you select **Terms** from the **Group by**
dropdown in **TSVB**, you can calculate the top values for multiple fields.

* **Customize the legend size.** In all visualization editors,
you can now increase or decrease the visibility of your legend by changing the size.

[float]
=== Maps

[float]
==== Display clusters as hexagons

In *Maps*, you can now display your clusters as hexagons
instead of rectangles. This feature adds another beautiful, and more precise way, to
visualize your geo_point fields.

[float]
==== Create region maps from Lens

You can now create region maps
(also called choropleth maps) from *Lens*.

[float]
==== Add custom icons

Upload an SVG image and use it as icons in your maps.
Edit your maps layer, and then select
*Layer Style> Symbol style > Icon > Add custom icon*.

[float]
=== Alerting

[float]
==== Snooze rules

*Alerting* introduces the ability to snooze rules to suppress notifications
and actions for a user-defined duration. You'll never miss an
action because you forgot to unmute a rule while handling problems that arose
unexpectedly or during known downtimes. For more information, check
{kibana-ref}/create-and-manage-rules.html#controlling-rules[Snooze and disable rules].

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-alerting-snooze.png["UI for enabling snooze mode"]

[float]
==== View rule history

For better observability and monitoring of your rules, {kib} now
displays the execution history of your rules and actions. You can customize the
history view to include granular information with an array of impactful data points,
including the underlying alerting query durations,
the number of actions that were triggered or errored, alert context,
rule execution timeouts, and more.

[float]
==== Configure rules

*Alerting* introduces configurable guardrails so that as an admin,
you can apply your policies on a level deeper than role-based access control
(RBAC) and fully stay on top of the stress that the alerting system may put on
your instance, in case your users misconfigured rules. This way you have peace
of mind that your instance remains performant.

Specifically, in the `kibana.yml` file:

* Configure your rule queries to timeout after a custom time expires without the
query returning. You can also do this on a per rule type basis with the
`xpack.alerting.run.timeout` setting.
* Configure a minimum value for the interval with which your rules run with the
`xpack.alerting.rules.minimumScheduleInterval.value` setting. Strictly enforce
the minimum interval or just display warnings on the UI with the
`xpack.alerting.rules.minimumScheduleInterval.enforce` setting.

* Configure the maximum number of actions that a rule can generate with the
`xpack.alerting.rules.run.actions.max` setting. Specify a different cap for your
different rule types with the `xpack.alerting.rules.run.ruleTypeOverrides`
setting, depending on your needs.

For more information, refer to
{kibana-ref}/alert-action-settings-kb.html#action-settings[Action settings].

[float]
==== New xMatters connector

With the new {kibana-ref}/xmatters-action-type.html[xMatters connector], you can
configure the severity of a rule and assign it tags, so the right
resources are notified to take action on the corresponding incidents. With the xMatters action,
you can leverage schedules and escalations to engage with the right resources.
The xMatters connector supports Basic and URL authentication.

[float]
==== Cases now in the Stack (technical preview)

This release brings *Cases* into the Stack,
so that you can open and track issues outside Elastic Solutions.
Access *Cases* in *Stack Management* under *Alerts and Insights*.
For more information, check {kibana-ref}/cases.html[Cases].


[float]
=== Machine learning

[float]
==== Testing trained models in {kib}

From 8.2, users are able to test certain trained models in {kib}. The new action 
is introduced under *Machine learning > Trained Models* and it accepts 
user-specified input to test models. Initially supported models are
`lang_ident_model_1` (language identification) and third party named entity
recognition (NER) models.

[float]
==== Machine learning trained models are now space-aware

Machine learning trained models are space-aware starting in 8.2. Spaces enable 
you to organize your {kib} saved objects into meaningful categories. Once a 
trained model is limited to a {kib} space, users only see it if they are 
assigned to the same space. A warning is shown if any trained models are missing 
their saved objects; automatic synchronization also occurs periodically to 
address any missing objects.
