[[alerting-generally-available]]
=== Alerting is generally available
The first Beta version of the new {kib} *Alerting* was released in 7.7.
In 7.11, *Alerting* is generally available (GA), which means that it
is officially recommended for use in production. *Alerting* guides you
through building your alerts, provides seamless integration with
*Elastic Security* and *Elastic Observability*, integrates with the external
systems where your workflows run, and more. For more information,
check out <<alerting-getting-started,Alerting and Actions>>.

With 7.11, comes the following enhancements:

* Set up an alert to produce a notification or incident only when the alert changes state.
* Optionally set your PagerDuty incidents to auto-resolve once your alert returns to normal.
* Use Microsoft Teams as part of the ever-growing collection of connectors.

[[anonymous-access-available]]
=== Anonymous access and improved audit logging

Anonymous access gives users access to {kib} without requiring them to
provide credentials. This is useful if you want your users to skip the
login step when you embed dashboards in another application or set up a demo
{kib} instance in your internal network, while keeping other security features intact.
To get started with anonymous access, check out {kibana-ref}/kibana-authentication.html#anonymous-authentication[the docs].

Also in 7.11, {kib}’s audit logging was completely
revamped. When configured, {kib} will record a
{kibana-ref}/xpack-security-audit-logging.html#xpack-security-ecs-audit-logging[wide array of user activity]
in a dedicated log file. These logs are compliant with the
{ecs-ref}/index.html[ECS specification],
and are easily ingested using Filebeat’s https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/7.11/filebeat-module-kibana.html[{kib} module].
Check out {kibana-ref}/security-settings-kb.html#ecs-audit-logging-settings[the docs]
to configure the new audit logger, and gain more insight in your user’s activity.

[[introducing-tags]]
=== Introducing tags for content management

Tags makes it easier for you to manage your content. Tags are keywords or labels
that you assign to {kib} saved objects, such as dashboards and visualizations,
so you can classify them in a way that is meaningful to you.

The biggest advantage of tags is that they allow you to quickly group and
manage related objects. For example, if you tag objects with “design”,
you can search and filter on the tag to see related objects.
See {kibana-ref}/managing-tags.html[Tags] for information on saving tags
with your content, filtering on them, and searching across {kib} for related assets.

[float]
[[deep-linking-in-search]]
=== Navigational search deep links into apps

In 7.10, {kib} added navigational search, so you can rapidly move to a dashboard,
visualization, or application in just a few keystrokes. This release enhances
search suggestions to include deep links into applications,
allowing you to directly navigate to the views you need most.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/images/highlights-deep-links.png[Global search field with suggestions for deep links into apps]

The enhanced search syntax in 7.11 lets you filter results by type and by tag.
For example you can find objects by type using the `syntax type:dashboard dashboard_name`
and by tag using `tag:tag-name`. See
{kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[navigational search] for more examples.

[float]
[[improved-visualization-chooser]]
=== Simplier visualization workflow

{kib} simplifies the visualization workflow by providing guidance for
which visualization editor to use for your type of data. To view the new visualization selector,
open *Dashboard*, click *Create visualization*, and then click *Create panel*.
*Lens*, {kib}'s' drag and drop editor, is recommended for most users.

[[maps-layers-styles-alerts]]
=== Maps&mdash;Elastic Maps Server, tracks layer, & more

[float]
==== Elastic Maps Server

The Elastic Maps Service powers *Maps* for most instances of {kib}.
In 7.11, for customers in a secure, air-gapped environment, you can now use the
same maps and boundaries that come with {kib} by default. The Elastic Maps Server
can be downloaded and deployed to your self-managed environment.

[float]
==== Tracks layer

The new tracks layer is a simple
way to connect the dots, taking an index of point locations by time and displaying
them as a line. This is good for customers working with GPS, sensor, or
location-tracked time-series data, who want to visualize the routes and paths of their data.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/images/highlights-tracks-layer.png[Tracks layer in Maps]

[float]
==== Style by percentile

*Maps* has a new option for styling layers. Now you can apply color
by percentile data ranges, making it easier to separate above and below the mean.
You can add any number of percentile ranges.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/images/highlights-style-by-percentile.png[Style by percentile in Maps]

[float]
==== Geo alerts (Beta)

In 7.10, {kib} introduced a new location-driven alert called the tracking alert.
Enhanced in 7.11, the tracking alert now allows you to trigger alerts when entities enter,
leave, or cross a boundary. Further, there's a new geographic alert based on containment.
You can now monitor the location of an entity as long as it is within a specified boundary
with the containment alert.

[float]
[[Lens-color-palettes]]
=== Lens has new palettes

Choose from one of the new *Lens* palettes to make your visualizations
really stand out. Use a diverging palette to show status, a gradient palette
for a muted look, or a backwards compatible palette to blend with existing dashboards.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/images/highlights-lens-color-palette.png[Lens color palettes]

*Lens* now supports *drag to reorder* in all chart types.
Reprioritize how the data displays in your visualizations by reordering the fields in the editor.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/images/highlights-drag-to-reorder.png[Lens drag to reorder for all chart types]

*Lens* also has improved tables&mdash;click the column header to sort in place, or use the newly
introduced *last value* metric to create detail tables. For example,
visualize the most recent flight that has departed a given city.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/images/highlights-improved-tables.png[Improved tables in Lens]

More new *Lens* features:

* Download *Lens* panels as CSV from a dashboard.
* When you configure the *Top values* function, group “Other” values by default.
* From the editor, apply the *Median* function to fields.

[float]
[[drilldowns-trigger-types]]
=== Drilldowns offers new trigger types

When the drilldown feature was first introduced, it offered
the ability to click on a chart element,
known as a “trigger.” This release adds two new trigger types for use with
URL drilldowns.

[float]
==== Context menu trigger

A context menu trigger allows you to attach a drilldown to the panel context menu.
This trigger is useful for navigating to contextual information
related to a panel.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/images/highlights-context-trigger-menu.png[Drilldown context trigger menu]

[float]
==== Table row trigger

Previously, {kib} supported attaching a drilldown to a table. The table row
trigger expands on this functionality by allowing you to configure the URL
with one or more specific columns from a *Lens* table.

When your URL requires multiple parameters, you can present them in a table,
and use the URL template to format and concatenate the values.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/images/highlights-table-row-trigger.png[Drilldown table row trigger]

[float]
[[custom-labels-for-fields]]
=== Fields now support custom labels

Custom labels are especially useful for displaying long field names in much shorter versions.
These labels appear in *Discover*, *Maps*, and *Visualize* (not yet in TSVB, but coming soon).
To add a custom label to a field, go to *Stack Management > Index Pattern*. Details are in <<managing-fields,the documentation>>.

[float]
[[ml-jobs-space]]
=== {ml-cap} jobs are now space-aware

{anomaly-detect-cap} and {dfanalytics} jobs are space-aware starting in 7.11. 
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[Spaces] enable you to organize your {ml} jobs 
and other {kib} saved objects into meaningful categories. Once a {ml} job is 
limited to a {kib} space, users only see the job if they are assigned to the 
same space. Extra checks for spaces have been added when deleting jobs, and a 
warning is shown if any jobs are missing their saved objects.


[float]
[[index-data-visualizer-design]]
=== Index Data Visualizer has new design

The {ml-cap} Data Visualizer provides a view into your indices to give a better 
understanding of the fields in the data set prior to creating {anomaly-detect} 
or {dfanalytics-jobs}. The Data Visualizer went through a major redesign and the 
previous card based display is switched to a table. It has the benefit of a more 
compact layout, a new document count chart, and expanded rows for viewing 
details on individual fields.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/images/highlights-index-data-vis-design.png[Index data visualizer table]


[float]
[[single-metric-viewer-nav]]
=== Enhanced navigation for the Single Metric Viewer

The new navigation enables you to explore the results of the {anomaly-jobs} 
easier and provides more control for selecting the partitioning field in the 
Single Metric Viewer. An indication of the maximum anomaly score for each value 
is now displayed, and you have the possibility to sort matches by score or name 
and to limit the selection to values which are anomalous over the selected time 
range.
