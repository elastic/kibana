=== Index patterns are now data views

exactly as index patterns did in previous releases.

=== Desaturated basemaps are the default

The default basemaps in light and dark themes now use
the more understated desaturated basemap. This gives your data the most
visual attention in *Maps*.

=== Discover has field statistics (beta)

Enable the new {kibana-ref}/field-statistics.html[*Field statistics*] view
for a summary of all fields (or just selected fields) in your data.
You'll find interesting fields to visualize and learn more about the shape of your data.
The *Field statistics* view
is similar to the Index Data Visualizerin {ml-app}.

Canvas also now has these two features similar to *Dashboard*.

* You can now create embedded visualizations in your *Canvas* workpads. Just like in *Dashboard*,
promote favorites to the *Visualization Library* for re-use.

* Editing a visualization from *Canvas* will return you to *Canvas*s when you
click *Save and close* &mdash; just like in *Dashboard*. Fewer clicks to author
and edit existing presentations.
