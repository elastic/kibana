=== Security features enabled by default

Authentication, authorization, and multi-tenancy
with {kib} *Spaces* are on-by-default, with almost no configuration effort.
When you use {kib} for the first time, you're presented with a new interactive
UI that helps you securely set up and connect {kib} to {es}.
Simply paste the enrollment token that you receive when you start
{es}, and {kib} sets up all the security features
and connects to {es} over TLS. Read
https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-simplified-elastic-stack-security[the blog] for full details.

[[index-pattern-rename]]
=== Index patterns are now data views
Renaming index patterns to data views creates the foundation for building
new and exciting features in {kib}. Your data views work
exactly as index patterns did in previous releases.

[float]
=== Vector tiles and basemap updated

Elastic offers full vector tile support, now generally available, in {kib} *Maps*.
Enjoy faster performance and smooth navigation of your data at scale.

The default basemaps in light and dark themes now use
the more understated desaturated basemap. This gives your data the most
visual attention.

[float]
=== Discover has field statistics (beta)

Enable the new {kibana-ref}/show-field-statistics.html[*Field statistics*] view
for a summary of all fields (or just selected fields) in your data.
You'll find interesting fields to visualize and learn more about the shape of your data.
The *Field statistics* view
is similar to the *Index Data Visualizer* in *{ml-app}*.

[float]
=== Multi-layered time axis redesigned
To solve key readability and
formatting issues, the time axis was upgraded in *Lens*, *TSVB*,
aggregation-based visualizations, and *Discover*.
The multi-layered format enables you to create easier to understand visualizations from your data.

=== Heatmaps display data labels

Enable *Show* on labels, and
when thereâ€™s room, a data label appears in each heatmap cell.

=== Canvas editing toolbar renovated
This new design brings a set of editing controls in *Canvas*,
similar to what you see in *Dashboard*.
Use the toolbar to quickly access the *Visualization Library* and
create elements and visualizations.

You can also now
create embedded visualizations in your *Canvas* workpads.
Just like in *Dashboard*, you can promote favorites to the *Visualization Library* for re-use.

[float]
=== {ml-cap} model management

You can now add more trained models to bring modern
{ml-docs}/ml-nlp-overview.html[{nlp} (NLP)] use cases to the {stack}. NLP models exist
alongside {dfanalytics} models. The **Model Management** page shows
approximations for memory usage on each {ml} node and displays high level stats
for {infer} rates for each deployed trained model. These details enable you to
make node sizing decisions for {ml} nodes.
