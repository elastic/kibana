=== Alerts available from Discover

You can now create search threshold rules from *Discover*,
making it easy to be notified when documents change so you can turn your data into action.
Start by defining the data view, query, and filter conditions for when you want to be alerted.
Then choose the messaging services where you want to be notified when your alert conditions are met,
and finally, trigger workflows across third-party integrations such as ServiceNow and Slack.
For information about alerts, check <<alerting-getting-started, Alerting>>.

=== Improved Content Security Policy

{kib} now has experimental support for a more restrictive Content Security Policy.
Specifically, we have removed the need for script-src ‘unsafe-eval’,
which provides an additional level of protection against Cross-Site Scripting (“XSS”) attacks.

You can enable this feature by configuring csp.disableUnsafeEval: true in your kibana.yml:
