[[new-platform-7-9]]
=== A new, grown-up Kibana platform

As of 7.9,
the new development platform
for {kib} is complete. The most immediate difference is
that pages load faster as you navigate {kib}. If you're a developer,
the new platform enables you to build features faster and with greater efficiency.
For details, check out
https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-a-new-architecture-for-kibana[Introducing
a new architecture for {kib}].

[[search-7-9]]
=== Enterprise Search comes to {kib}

In 7.8, we reorganized the {kib} side navigation to make our Observability
and Security apps easier to find. In 7.9, we added Enterprise Search
to the side navigation. If you're an existing user of App Search and
Workplace Search, you can now launch directly into those environments in {kib}.
Check out https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/index.html[our documentation]
for more information.

[[lens-7-9]]
=== Multiple y-axes in Lens

Show two metrics on the y-axis at the same time in {kibana-ref}/lens.html[Lens].
This enables you to compare and contrast data of vastly different types and ranges.
For example, you might track the total page views for your web site,
which tallies in the millions. You're also interested
in the percentage of the web site bounce rates,
typically between 1 and 100. You can stack both metrics on top of one
another to quickly spot the outliers.

Also in 7.9, Lens debuts color pick, sort, and a fitting function.

[float]
[[canvas-7-9]]
=== Canvas variables for easy reuse

You can now can create variables to easily reuse the
strings and patterns in your Canvas elements. This is especially useful if you
frequently copy and paste your elements. For example, when you clone a large workpad and need
to connect your elements to a new index, you can use variables to quickly update the elements,
instead of changing the index for each individual element. For instructions, refer to the
{kibana-ref}/canvas.html[Canvas documentation].


[float]
[[dashboard-7-9]]
=== Dashboard to Discover explorations

Navigating between dashboards was a highlight in 7.8, and 7.9 adds
the ability to navigate from a dashboard to Discover.  The time range,
filters, and other parameters remain the same, so you can continue your
analysis from a new perspective. For example,
your dashboard might have a visualization for overall HTTP responses.
You can navigate to Discover to see the saved search
for HTTP responses. The new {kibana-ref}/explore-underlying-data.html[*Explore underlying data*]
action is available for visualizations
backed by a single index pattern.

[float]
[[maps-7-9-geo-shape]]
=== geo_shape fields at scale in Maps

Maps now allows you to create {kibana-ref}/maps-grid-aggregation.html[geo_shape fields with {es} aggregations].
This means that you can plot your geo_shape fields at scale
just like your geo_point fields.
You can create a layer that clusters your lines and polygons until
you zoom into an area with less than 10,000 discrete documents. Then,
youâ€™ll see individual lines and polygons.

[float]
[[maps-7-9-vector-tile]]
=== Vector tile layers available in Maps

Maps also introduces a new {kibana-ref}//tile-layer.html[vector tile layer]&mdash;you can add
layers to your map for data services that implement the
Mapbox vector tile specification.

[float]
[[alert-7-9]]
=== ServiceNow action in Alerts

Alerting introduces a ServiceNow action that pushes or updates
data to a new incident in ServiceNow. See the {kibana-ref}/servicenow-action-type.html[ServiceNow docs]
for details.
