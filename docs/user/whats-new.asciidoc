=== Upgrade Assistant for 8.x

Upgrade Assistant is your one-stop shop to help you prepare for upgrading to 8.x.
Review and address {es} and {kib} deprecation issues, analyze {es} deprecation logs,
migrate system indices, and back up your data before upgrading, all from within this app.

=== Unified integrations view

All ingest options for Elastic have been moved to the *Integrations* view.
This provides a more consistent experience for onboarding to Elastic and increases
the discoverability of integrations by providing all of them in a single view.
Any entry points for adding integrations now route to this page.

=== Reference lines in Lens

Reference lines are now available in *Lens* to help you easily identify important values in your visualizations. You create reference lines with static values, dynamic data using {es} *Quick Functions*, or define with a custom *Formula*. Reference lines can come from separate index patterns, such as a goal dataset that is independent of the source data.

With reference lines, you can:

* Track metrics against goals, warning zones, and more.
* Add display options, such as color, icons, and labels.
* Apply color to the area above or below the reference line.

=== Enhancements to visualization editors

{kib} now offers even more ways to work with your visualizations:

* *Custom field formats in TSVB.*
Take advantage of the field formatters from your index pattern in
*TSVB*&mdash;or override the format for a specific visualization.
* *Filter bar in TSVB.*
In *TSVB* layers, you always had the ability to ignore global filters, 
but now you can change the global filter.
* *View Lens data and requests.*
You can now view the data in visualizations and the requests that collected the data right in the *Lens* editor.
* *View requests in Console.*
View the requests that collect the data in visualizations in *Console*, which is especially useful 
to inspect your *TSVB* data without having to edit the filters for each series.
* *Auto fit rows to content.*  
You can now specify to automatically resize *Aggregation-based* data table rows so that text and images are fully visible.

==== New and updated connectors

Alerting has grown its collection of connectors with the addition of the ServiceNow ITOM
connector, for easy integration with ServiceNow event management. In addition to ITOM,
{kib} provides a more efficient integration for ServiceNow ITSM and SecOps connectors
with certified applications on the ServiceNow store. Another enhancement to
connectors is the ability to authenticate the email connector with OAuth 2.0
Client Credentials for the MS Exchange email service.

==== Rule duration on display

In *Rules and Connectors*, the *Rules* view now includes the rule duration field, which shows how long a rule is taking to
complete execution. This helps you identify rules that run longer than you might anticipate.

On the rule details page, you can observe the duration for the last 30 executions.
