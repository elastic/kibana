*Document Explorer*, the powerful new way to analyze and explore your data with *Discover*,

=== Visualization editors

[float]
==== Auto-apply your changes in Lens

By default, *Lens* has always automatically applied the changes you make to visualizations.
Now you can control when *Lens* applies your changes and generates suggestions with
the new ability to turn on and off auto-apply. To start manually applying your changes,
click *Settings* in the toolbar, then deselect *Auto-apply visualization changes*.
For more information, check {kibana-ref}/lens.html#create-the-visualization-panel[Create visualizations].

to *Lens* visualizations in tech preview. Customize the appearance of annotations with text,
icons, colors, and more. For more information, check {kibana-ref}/lens.html#add-annotations[Add annotations].

==== Explore Lens visualization data in Discover

For further exploration of your data, you can now open *Lens* visualization data
in *Discover*. With *Discover* you can view the documents in the fields you used
to create the visualization, then navigate back to *Lens* to finish creating your

==== Enhancements to visualization editors

{kib} offers even more ways to create visualizations:

* **Metric visualization.** Use the new Metric visualization type in **Lens**
to show the latest or earliest data, or the last value.

* **Group by multiple fields in TSVB.** When you select **Terms** from the **Group by**
dropdown in **TSVB**, you can calculate the top values for multiple fields.

* **Customize the legend size.** In all visualization editors,
you can now increase or decrease the visibility of your legend by changing the size.

[float]
=== Maps

[float]
==== Display clusters as hexagons

In *Maps*, you can now display your clusters as hexagons
instead of rectangles. This feature adds another beautiful, and more precise way, to
visualize your geo_point fields. Hexagon aggregation is
a https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription feature].

=== Alerting

[float]
==== Temporarily pause rules

*Alerting* introduces the ability to snooze rules to suppress notifications
and actions for a user-defined duration. You'll never miss an
action because you forgot to unmute a rule while handling problems that arose
unexpectedly or during known downtimes.

[float]
==== View rule history

For better observability and monitoring of your rules, {kib} now
displays the execution history of your rules and actions. You can customize the
history view to include granular information with an array of impactful data points,
including the underlying alerting query durations,
the number of actions that were triggered or errored, alert context,
rule execution timeouts, and more.

[float]
==== Configure rules

*Alerting* introduces configurable guardrails so that as an admin,
you can apply your policies on a level deeper than RBAC and fully stay on top of
the stress that the alerting system may put on your instance, in case your users misconfigured rules.
This way you have peace of mind that your instance remains performant.

Specifically, in the kibana.yml file:

* Configure your rule queries to timeout after a custom time expires without the query returning.
You can also do this on a per rule type basis.
Check the {kibana-ref}/alert-action-settings-kb.html#action-settings[documentation] for the `xpack.alerting.run.timeout` setting.

* Configure a minimum value for the interval with which your rules run. Strictly enforce the
minimum interval or just display warnings on the UI. Check the
 {kibana-ref}/alert-action-settings-kb.html#action-settings[documentation] for the
`xpack.alerting.rules.minimumScheduleInterval` settings.

* Configure the maximum number of actions that a rule can generate. Specify a different cap for your
different rule types, depending on your needs.
Check the {kibana-ref}/alert-action-settings-kb.html#action-settings[documentation] for the `xpack.alerting.run.actions.max` setting.

[float]
==== New xMatters connector

With the new xMatters connector, you can
configure the severity of a rule and assign it tags, so the right
resources are notified to take action on the corresponding incidents. With the xMatters action,
you can leverage schedules and escalations to engage with the right resources.
The xMatters connector supports Basic and URL authentication.

[float]
==== Cases now in the Stack (technical preview)

This release brings *Cases* into the Stack,
so that you can open and track issues outside Elastic Solutions.
Access *Cases* in *Stack Management* under *Alerts and Insights*.
For more information, check {kibana-ref}/cases.html[Cases].
