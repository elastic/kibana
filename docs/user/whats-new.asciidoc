=== Discover

[float]
==== Field statistics on by default

Find fields to visualize and learn more about the shape of your data
with *Field statistics*.  This view
is similar to the *Index Data Visualizer* in *{ml-app}*.
For details, check {kibana-ref}/show-field-statistics.html[Explore the fields in your data].

[float]
==== New $ field syntax for Painless scripts
Creating runtime fields is now easier and more reliable.
{kib} has a shortcut for the field method when a script context supports the scripting fields API.
This shortcut replaces `field('fieldname').get(defaultValue)` with `$('fieldname', defaultValue)`.
For more information, check {kibana-ref}/managing-data-views.html#runtime-fields[Explore your data with runtime fields].

*Before*

[source,js]
----------------------------------
if (!doc.containsKey('myfield') || doc['myfield'].empty) { return "unavailable" } else { return doc['myfield'].value }
----------------------------------

*After*

[source,js]
----------------------------------
$('myfield', 'unavailable')
----------------------------------

[float]
==== Calling all Document Explorers

Try the new {kibana-ref}/document-explorer.html[Document Explorer], which
helps you quickly sort, select, and compare data, resize columns,
and view documents in fullscreen. The Document Explorer is in beta in 8.1.


[float]
=== Dashboard

[float]
==== Synchronized ML anomaly visualizations
*{ml-app}* visualizations now synchronize your cursor position with the visualization panels you create with
*Lens*, *TSVB*, *Timelion*, and *Aggregation-based* editors.
Highlight an anomaly in time and see a visual indication
of this time on other panels.
The reverse is also true&mdash;hovering in another editor highlights the same point-in-time in *{ml-app}* panels.

[float]
=== Canvas

[float]
==== Add heatmap elements to workpads
Create heatmaps in workpads using *Canvas*-only functionality to fetch data, such as {es} SQL.
Configure your heatmap with flexible legend, axis,
and visual controls.

[float]
==== New filter capabilities
Use the new *Filter* panel on any object to see which objects are filtering it.
This helps you author your workpad with the right behavior.

[float]
=== Lens & visualizations

[float]
==== Combine fields with drag and drop

Combine multiple fields with drag and drop to view the top combinations in *Lens*.
You'll find the combinations that contribute most to your metrics' performance.

[role="screenshot"]

[float]
==== Top values by rarity

Take advantage of the {es} rare terms aggregations in *Lens* and view the top values by rarity.
You'll find answers to "What's not normal here?"

[float]
==== Horizontal and vertical gauges

Use the gauge visualization to add extra context to your metrics.
Show minimum and maximum values dynamically by using a quick function or custom formula,
or set a static value for known metric ranges. Include a goal value to see
if a metric is above or below the goal. Set color bands to show ranges visually&mdash;similar
to reference lines in bar, line, and area visualizations. The gauge visualization is
in technical preview in 8.1.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-lens-guage.png[Example horizontal gauge with target value in Lens, width=50%]

[float]
==== Mosaic visualization

Add a mosaic visualization, also known as marimekko or mekko, for side-by-side
comparison of two dimensions against a single metric. Treemaps and two-layered
pies do this as well, but the mosaic can be more effective for visual comparisons
by aligning the colors for the terms side-by-side. For the best mosaic visualizations, create with low cardinality dimensions.
The mosaic visualization is in technical preview in 8.1.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-lens-mosaic.png[Example mosaic visualization in Lens]

[float]
==== Waffle visualization

Create proportional waffle visualizations, which make
more efficient use of space than pie charts.
Waffles are designed for square spaces, which aligns well with how
most dashboards are created. Because waffles display the data in 1% blocks, they are best for low cardinality breakdowns, and are not recommended for small partitions.
You might be surprised how small you can make a waffle
visualization and maintain readability. The waffle visualization is in technical preview in 8.1.

image::images/highlights-lens-waffle.png[Example waffle visualization in Lens, width=50%]

[float]
==== Color by value in metrics

Apply color to the text and background of metric visualizations
based on the value of the metric. Set up color stops for multiple colors, similar
to what you can do in *Lens* tables, heatmaps, and gauge.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-lens-metric.png[Metric color options in Lens, width=75%]

[float]
==== Sort tables in dashboard view mode
Enable users with view-only dashboard privileges to sort data tables on the fly, similar to the existing visualization editor behavior.

[float]
==== Filter formulas globally

Filter each part of your formula with KQL
without copying or pasting to all the aggregations in the formula.

[float]
==== Configurable donut visualizations
Configure the inner area size (or donut hole) in the donut
visualization. The inner area is a smaller size by default to allow maximize space for
labels. You can change this option in *Lens*.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-lens-donut.png[Inner area size setting in Lens donuts,width=75%]

[float]
==== Collapsable Suggestions panel

Get back some vertical space in *Lens* and save on the query cost of
suggestions by collapsing the *Suggestions* panel. {kib} remembers when you collapse
your suggestions the next time you use the editor with the same browser.

[float]
==== Improved color controls

The revised color stop editing experience offers a more streamlined way to specify
what happens outside of the defined ranges (above and below the minimum and maximum).
These revised controls also add the ability to evenly distribute color stops
in one click. Look for the new functionality in *Lens* tables, heatmaps, metrics,
and gauges.

[float]
=== Maps

[float]
==== Shapefile upload
Load shapefiles into Elastic with this simple but powerful uploader built
right into the *Maps* application. Easily load local open data and boundaries for analysis and comparison.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-maps-shapefile.png[Shapefile upload in Maps]

[float]
==== Vector tiles now the default
All new polygon layers now enable *Use vector tiles* by default.
Vector tiles offer the best performance and smooth
zooming over the alternative methods. You can change the scaling options
in layer settings if you prefer the previous approach.

[float]
=== {ml-cap}

[float]
==== {ml-cap} UI enhancements: easier anomaly investigation, new side navigation

8.1 contains a couple of enhancements on the {ml} UI.
One of the enhancements helps the user interpret the results of their 
{anomaly-jobs} and explore what else is happening around the time of an anomaly. 
In the anomalies table a drilldown link to Discover is automatically available 
to investigate the anomaly in the context of the source data. 
For the charts in the Anomaly Explorer, synchronized `crosshair` lines are 
provided on hover so that you can see what other anomalous behavior is occurring 
at a point in time.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-anomaly.gif[Anomaly Explorer charts]

The top navigation bar is now replaced with side navigation. The side navigation 
is collapsible, so views such as the Anomaly Explorer and Single Metric Viewer 
can benefit from being viewed at full width if desired.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-anomaly-explorer.png[Side navigation]

[float]
==== {transform-cap} enhancements

You can now reset and re-run your {transform} from the beginning. 
{transform-cap} counters will be reset to zero and if the destination index was 
created by the transform it will also be deleted.

Other features previously only available to API users are also added to the UI 
for 8.1: the ability to configure an ingest pipeline to enrich the data 
persisted to the destination index, and the terms aggregation is available in 
the list of options when building the aggregations in the pivot {transform} 
wizard.

[float]
==== {ml-cap} anomaly layers in Maps

Maps introduces a new vector layer–you can add layers to your maps that display 
points or lines for the anomalies in your geographic data.

[float]
=== ResponseOps

[float]
==== Summary stats bar in Cases

The new section at the top of the Cases view displays summary statistics for the 
case, such as total numer of alerts, and counts of associated users and hosts. 
The summarized information in the stats bar help the analyst to determine the 
priority of a case and indicate effectiveness.
