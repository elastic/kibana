=== Discover

[discrete]
==== Machine learning pattern analysis

preview:[] You can now run a pattern analysis directly from *Discover*,
making it easy to explore your machine learning log pattern data.
In *Discover*, hover over a field to run and load the pattern analysis,
then select one or more patterns to filter for or filter out,
displaying only the logs you’re interested in.

==== Add columns to the document table with drag & drop

*Discover* now provides you with a simple drag-and-drop experience
that helps you explore your data in just a few clicks.
From the *Available fields* list, drag the fields you want to explore to the
document table, then watch as *Discover* automatically creates columns for each of your fields.

=== Lens

[discrete]
==== Better visualization loading time with sampling

When you create visualizations for your dashboards,
check out the new *Sampling* layer setting.
Using the slider, select the percentage between performance and accuracy.
Lowering the sampling percentage improves the visualization loading time,
and raising the percentage improves the accuracy. When added to dashboards,
the visualization now includes a sampling notification.

[discrete]
==== A better way to change settings

=== Maps

[discrete]
==== Reduce clutter with metric filtering

Use metric filtering to hide aggregation buckets to reduce clutter and highlight areas of interest.
Consider this map, where areas with more traffic are obscured by areas with little traffic.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-map-with-web-traffic.png[Metric filtering in maps]

With configure metric filtering, you can hide the clusters with little web traffic.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-maps-metric-filtering.png[How to configure metric filtering, width="50%"]

The map now has less visual clutter and it’s easier to visualize areas with high web traffic,
enabling your marketing team to better target high value areas.

[discrete]
=== Machine learning

[discrete]
==== {transform-cap} ‘schedule now’ added to UI

The {transform} UI has been updated to make use of the *Schedule now*
functionality. This schedules a {transform} to instantly process new data
without waiting for the configured interval between checks for changes in the
source indices. This operation is useful for {transforms} with a longer
frequency setting, where the {transform} can be activated to update directly
after data has been uploaded. Use this feature on individual {transforms} and
as a bulk action on multiple {transforms}.

[discrete]
==== ELSER configuration on Trained Models UI

Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR (ELSER) is a {ml} model newly added to the
library. ELSER improves your search relevance by enabling you to perform
semantic search. This search type operates on the meaning of words and does
not search only on literal terms. The *Trained Models* UI enables you to easily
download and deploy the model in your cluster and use ELSER in an {infer}
pipeline or a text expansion query.

[discrete]
==== Change point detection&mdash;multiple metrics and split fields

Change point detection was introduced in 8.7 as part of AIOps Labs. In 8.8, it
supports multiple change point configurations, which enables you to view data
from different metrics and partitions in a table layout with change point
previews. It accommodates more results on a single page, provides more sorting
possibilities, and makes it possible to zoom in on particular entries.
It has updated controls for the metric and split fields, which provides easy
access to the top values and distribution of the configuring field.
The quick filter action simplifies the investigation of certain partitions or
excludes them from the analysis.

[discrete]
==== {dfanalytics-cap} drilldown actions

Starting in 8.8, the results data grid provides a link in the *Actions* column to
*Discover* filtering for the row's field/values.
Creating custom URLs for jobs is also supported from the jobs list. You can
create a link to *Discover*, *Dashboard*, or an external URL. You can
also test the configured custom URL.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-ml-dfa-drilldown-1.png[Data frame analytics custom URLs]

The custom URLs you create appear in the {dfanalytics} results table row.
You can click through to any URL with the values from that row.

[discrete]
=== Alerting

[discrete]
==== Maintenance windows

Schedule single or recurring maintenance windows to reduce alert noise and suppress notifications.
For example, if you have a planned outage or event, a maintenance window prevents false alarms during this period.
// For more information, check <<maintenance-windows>>.

[discrete]
=== Cases

These features are all available for cases in *{stack-manage-app}*, *{observability}*, and the *{security-app}*.

[discrete]
==== Case activities

In 8.8, when you view a case, there are new *Comments* and *History* filters on the *Activity* tab.
These filters separate comments from user and system actions, such as alerts and user assignments.
Pagination and sorting are now also provided on this tab.

[discrete]
==== Case attachments

You can now attach files to cases for better investigation processes.
With the new capability, you can upload indicators of compromise (IOCs)
and other files to support alert and case triage. For more information, check <<add-case-files>>.

[discrete]
=== Per-user dark mode

Continuing our user-first effort for personalization and collaboration,
you can now customize the theme by setting dark mode individually.
Choose between dark mode, light mode, or the default theme in the space.
