[[highlights-8.3-discover]]
=== Alerts available from Discover

You can now create search threshold rules from *Discover*,
making it easy to be notified when documents change so you can turn your data into action.
Start by defining the data view, query, and filter conditions for when you want to be alerted.
Then choose the messaging services where you want to be notified when your alert conditions are met,
and finally, trigger workflows across third-party integrations such as ServiceNow and Slack.
For information about alerts, check {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting].

factors that make filtering fast. Now, you can make filtering on popular fields
easy for all your dashboard users.

[float]
==== Accuracy mode in Lens
When creating *Lens* visualizations with the *Top values* function,
you can now enable accuracy mode. This mode improves the accuracy of results for
high-cardinality data by using more resources in your {es} cluster.
For information, check {kibana-ref}/lens.html[Lens].

[float]
==== Synchronized tooltips in Lens

To make it easier to compare multiple time series visualizations,
dashboards now include a *Sync tooltips across panels* option.
When enabled and you hover your cursor over a chart, the tooltips on all
other related dashboard charts automatically appear at the same data point or moment in time.
For information, check {kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[Dashboard].

[[highlights-8.3-maps]]
=== Enhancements to Maps

[float]
==== Language selector

You can now select Arabic, German, English, Spanish,
French, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese for country

the language for basemap labels.

[[highlights-8.3-security]]
=== Improved Content Security Policy

{kib} now has experimental support for a more restrictive
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP[Content Security Policy](CSP).
Specifically, we removed the need for `script-src 'unsafe-eval'`,
which provides an additional level of protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

To enable this feature, configure `csp.disableUnsafeEval: true` in your `kibana.yml`.

flyout, where you can enter input text for testing. View the output
using text highlighting or as JSON output.

Trained models are available for the following tasks:
language identification, named entity recognition (NER), text classification, question answering,
zero-shot text classification, text embedding, and fill task.

Osquery syntax, which is a superset of SQLite, so that you can save and run
queries using a standard SQL format.
