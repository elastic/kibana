==== Use a {data-source} without saving

This new feature allows you to explore your data in *Discover*, *Lens*, and *Maps*
without making it visible to others in your space.
This is useful for exploring newly ingested data and for trying out your data in different formats for the same visualization.
You can save the {data-source} later
if you create a search or visualization that you want to share.

==== Better insights to your data

The popover in the field list now shows more and better data, similar to *Lens* and *Fields Statistics*:

* Statistics are based on a sample of 5000 records per shard. Previously the sample size was 500 records.
* The popover shows up to top 10 values instead of just 5.
* The “exist” filter* appears at the top of the pop-over for better visibility.
* The distribution of values is shown for aggregatable fields.

==== Filter dashboard data with the new time slider control

Add the newest control for interacting with your dashboard data, the time slider control.
The time slider allows any dashboard viewer to playback and scrub through the data by time,
or quickly view the data for a specific time range, just like a song or movie.
