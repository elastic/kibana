=== Break down the histogram in Discover by value
*Discover*
adds capabilities for the user to re-size the histogram and do a “break down by”,
which is often used for logs exploration. The updated histogram contributess
to better logs exploration and is helpfule for
Observability use cases.

=== Convert your visualizations to Lens
Convert your TSVB and aggregation-based visualizations to the drag-and-drop *Lens* visualization editor,
directly from your dashboards. In *Edit* mode, the TSVB and aggregation-based dashboard panels
that display a dot supports the *Convert to Lens* functionality.
For more information, check {kibana-ref}/tsvb.html#edit-visualizations-in-lens[Open and edit TSVB visualizations in Lens]
and

=== Dashboard

[discrete]
==== Time slider updates
Selecting just the right time range is now even easier with the improvements to the time slider control.
Pin the start time to the beginning of your time range to show how data builds over a period of time.

[discrete]
==== Create complex filters
[preview] Create and apply multiple filters simultaneously for nested queries, and use the logical OR and AND operators using the improved dropdown menu experience.

[discrete]
==== Interactive chart filters

Filtering your data just got easier with interactive chart filters. When you right-click your chart data,
you can now select one or more filter values from the menu that appears, and link the filters with the OR operator.

=== Label positioning in Maps
Use the new *Label position* style setting to position labels above, below, or in the center of markers and icons.

More improvements:

* Hexagon clustering was added to {kib} 8.2, but only for geo_point fields. Now in 8.7, you can use hexagon clustering for geo_shape fields.

* The Maps time slider now uses the controls time slider, including enhancements such as pinning the start time. Refer
to {kibana-ref}/add-controls.html[Controls] for details.

=== Machine Learning

[discrete]
==== NLP is GA

In 8.7, the NLP capabilities of the Elastic product become generally availabe.
You can easily deploy and manage your trained NLP models to perform an array of tasks,
such astext classification (including zero-shot), question answering, named entity recognition, and more.


[discrete]
==== Anomaly detection jobs on geo data

A new geo wizard is available for creating lat_long anomaly detection jobs. This makes it easier
to create jobs to detect anomalies in the geographic location of your input data.

A new action enables you to quickly create anomaly detection jobs from map visualizations.
The jobs can now be created directly from a flyout within the Dashboard app.
For more advanced configuration, you can follow the link that takes you to the ML job wizard.

==== New view: memory usage by machine learning jobs

From 8.7, it is possible to view the memory usage of the open anomaly detection jobs
and the started data frame analytics jobs in the *Memory Usage* view.
The new view displays the total and available memory of your ML nodes, the memory usage of the deployed trained models,
and active machine learning jobs.

==== Change point detection in AIOps Labs

[preview] Change point detection identifies distribution changes, dips, spikes, and other
statistically significant change points in a metric. The change point detection UI
visualizes the change points in a bucket identified by the change point aggregation.

[discrete]
==== Field statistics in the machine learning job and transform wizards

Now you are able to view the statistics of the selectable fields in the anomaly detection,
the data frame analytics, and the transforms wizards. The field statistics,
displayed in a flyout, provide more meaningful context to help you select relevant fields.

=== Alerting

[discrete]
==== Alert flapping detection

Flapping occurs when the state of monitored assets, such as services, change too frequently,
resulting in multiple alerts that can distract you from more important issues.
To reduce the time to respond (MTTR), you can now identify frequent changes
in your monitored assets with pre-built configurations, highlight alerts in the UI,
and suppress related notifications. For more information, check {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting].

[discrete]
==== Alert action summarization

Currently, alert actions are triggered when the rule runs or when the alert status changes.
This behavior might lead to a notification storm when an alerting rule detects high cardinality of alerts.
These situations increase the time to respond to each event and affect the overall MTTR.
With the new alert actions summarization feature, users will be able to define how
to aggregate several actions into a single one with 2 different options:

* Alert summarization per each rule run. For example, all the alerts that are
detected by the same rule run will be sent in a single notification.
* Alert summarization per custom time interval.
For example, all the alerts that are detected in the last 10 hours will be sent in a single email.

This feature aims to improve the way users consume notifications from third parties
and improve the MTTR by reducing unnecessary noise.
For more information, check {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting].

==== Case management

New actions are now supported in the Case table view to streamline case management:

* More sorting and filtering options (by severity, status, last updates, and more)
* Bulk action for maintaining case assignees

[discrete]
==== Connector management

A new connector log is now available for users to troubleshoot their connectors’
behaviors and react when something goes wrong.

[discrete]
==== Rule management

A new bulk action for enabling and disabling rules is now supported in the Rule table view.

[discrete]
=== {kib} Security

[discrete]
==== Control the number of concurrent user sessions

Administrators can now control the number of concurrent user sessions by configuring
a limit through the maxSessions setting, for increased security. Once the limit is reached,
a newly created user session will displace the oldest one (by creation timestamp) for the same user.

==== {kib} audit logging enhanced with client IP

Since its introduction, we regularly enhance the {kibana-ref}/xpack-security-audit-logging.html[{kib} audit logging] with
additional data of security audit interest to our users. In 8.7 we add the client IP address field.
