=== Discover and ES|QL

[discrete]
==== Improving column reordering with draggable columns

We’re excited to announce an enhancement to the Discover table. You can now reorder columns by simply dragging them directly in the data table header. This intuitive feature reduces the number of interactions required to adjust your column layout by eliminating the need to open the Columns popover for sorting. This enhancement saves users valuable time and improves overall usability, leading to smoother and more efficient data exploration.

==== Starred ES|QL queries for quick access and reusability

With this release, you can favorite your ES|QL queries directly from your query history by starring them. These starred queries are saved under a dedicated Starred tab, allowing you quick access to your most-used queries across Kibana – not just within Discover. With the ability to manage up to 100 starred queries per user, you can sort them by timestamp and receive warnings as you approach the limit. This enhancement utilizes the favorites service at the user level, enabling users to reuse ES|QL queries in other areas of Kibana, such as the dashboard in-line editor and alerts.

=== Dashboards

==== Log Rate panels
You can now add Log Rate Analysis panels to your dashboards. Find them in the Logs analysis section alongside https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/8.16/whats-new.html#_log_pattern_analysis_dashboard_panels[Log Pattern Analysis panels] from 8.16. Find field-value pairs and log patterns that correlate with log spikes or dips across thousands of logs with just a few clicks, and move your analysis to Discover with ease.

==== Dashboard hover actions
We received feedback from users that the View and Edit modes in dashboards look too different, mainly because of the top bar in each panel that shows the panel menu. This bar created visual problems and changed the height of panels in Edit mode, especially when they didn’t have a title.

We fixed the issue by removing this top bar and making panel information and actions appear on top of the panel when users hover over it. Now users can get the same look in both Edit and View modes and the most common actions are accessible without having to click on the panel menu. This change improves the look and usability of dashboards.

==== Legacy visualization editors
Lens is the preferred visualization editor over TSVB and Aggregation-based since it already incorporates most features of the other two editors and is much easier to use. Offering three editors at this point makes the product more complex and calls for users to learn three different ways to visualize their data for no reason.

However, we are aware that there are still a few features that Lens is missing, such as small multiples or the ability to insert data and change the CSS in a Markdown file. For this reason, TSVB and Aggregation-based editors are being marked as legacy for now to encourage shifting to Lens. We will continue supporting them for some time until all features are fully incorporated into Lens, but we recommend that you start using Lens if you can. If you have good reasons to keep using TSVB or Aggregation-based editors, please add a comment to this public https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/198136[Github issue].

==== Improving CSV download for tables
When exporting tables in CSV in the past, you may have encountered issues with incorrect formatting of the data, rows, and columns. These issues have now been addressed and your exported CSV file shows exactly what you see in Kibana.

=== Alerting, cases, and connectors

[discrete]
==== Alerting scalability improvements
The Kibana alerting framework delivers enhanced scalability to meet the demands of growing workloads and is available across all {ecloud} hosted deployments. These improvements will provide you with 10x the existing capacity to run task-manager tasks -- alerting rules, connector actions, etc. We are observing the following performance improvements on early adopters of the new Kibana alerting framework:  

** 10x reduction in alerting task delays
** 2x increase in task execution throughput on average
** 50% fewer requests to Elasticsearch, resulting in lower overhead

These customers are now enjoying higher alerting capacity and faster response times without the need for any additional configuration or hardware. Furthermore, these improvements also bring in a new unparalleled scalability for our largest alerting customers, enabling deployments of up to 192 Kibana nodes running alerting rules.

We are very excited to see how these enhancements empower your alerting strategies with faster, more efficient, and scalable performance.

==== Kibana Cases support for file attachments through API actions 
The latest enhancements to Kibana Cases introduce highly requested functionality for managing security incidents and workflows. Users can now attach files to Kibana Cases via the public API, allowing them to enrich cases with supporting documentation, evidence, and other critical information. This improvement marks a significant enhancement in case management, providing incident response teams with greater flexibility to include all relevant details directly within their cases.

Additionally, this release expands integration capabilities with third-party systems such as ServiceNow and Tines. Users can now programmatically update cases through API calls from external platforms, streamlining workflows and fostering seamless collaboration across tools. These features make it easier to automate case updates and efficiently track complex security incidents in real time. For more details, see the https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/v8/operation/operation-createcasedefaultspace[API documentation].

[discrete]
==== Kibana Connector now supports Jira Data Center
This release introduces Kibana Connector support for Jira Data Center, expanding the existing integration capabilities previously available only for Jira Cloud instances. With this enhancement, organizations using on-premises Jira Data Center can now seamlessly integrate with Kibana, enabling more efficient workflows and streamlined incident management.

With this update, users can create and manage Jira issues directly from Kibana, regardless of their Jira deployment model. This expanded compatibility highlights our commitment to supporting diverse customer deployment setups and delivering enhanced functionality tailored to enterprise environments.

=== Machine Learning

[discrete]
==== Elastic Rerank 

In 8.17, we are introducing Elastic Rerank, Elastic’s new model for semantic reranking. Reranking can be used as the second stage on top of your existing search approach, whether this is lexical search, ELSER, or dense embeddings, resulting in significant semantic relevance gains mainly via recall improvements. This is very important for RAG applications, where you want to send the most relevant information to an LLM in order to generate the possible responses. 

Elastic Rerank is a cross-encoder architecture and it is in technical preview in 8.17.

To understand reranking and how you can use it to improve your search, read https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elastic-semantic-reranker-part-1[What is semantic reranking and how to use it], a blog by the creators of Elastic Rerank.

For more information on the Elastic Rerank model architecture and how it compares for relevance and cost against other reranking models, see https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elastic-semantic-reranker-part-2[Introducing Elastic Rerank] by the same authors.

[discrete]
==== Pre-configured default ELSER endpoint

With this release, we are introducing a pre-configured default ELSER endpoint. This removes the need for any inference configuration in order to use ELSER. There is no more need for an inference endpoint setup or for downloading the model and configuring threads and allocations through the trained models UI. Simply create a https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/semantic-text.html[semantic text] mapping with your indices and start using. The default inference endpoint will download, deploy and start using ELSER for inference with https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-auto-scale.html#nlp-model-adaptive-allocations[adaptive allocations] out of the box.
