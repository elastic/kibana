=== Discover

[float]
==== Field statistics on by default

Find interesting fields to visualize and learn more about the shape of your data
with *Field statistics*.  This view
is similar to the *Index Data Visualizer* in *{ml-app}*.
For details, check out {kibana-ref}/show-field-statistics.html[Explore the fields in your data].

[float]
==== New $ field syntax for Painless scripts
Creating runtime fields is now easier and more reliable. Use our new shortcut
for the field method when a script context supports the scripting fields API.
This shortcut replaces `field('fieldname').get(defaultValue)` with `$('fieldname', defaultValue)`.

*Before*

[source,js]
----------------------------------
if (!doc.containsKey('myfield') || doc['myfield'].empty) { return "unavailable" } else { return doc['myfield'].value }
----------------------------------

*After*

[source,js]
----------------------------------
$('myfield', 'unavailable')
----------------------------------

=== Dashboard

[float]
==== Synchronized ML anomaly visualizations
*{ml-app}* visualizations now synchronize cursor position with visualization panels
from Lens, TSVB, Timelion, and aggregation-based visualizations.
Highlight an anomaly in time and see a visual indication
of this time on other panels.
The reverse is true as well&mdash;hovering in another editor highlights the same point-in-time in *{ml-app}* panels.

[float]
=== Canvas

[float]
==== Native heatmap
Create heatmaps in Canvas and natively use Canvas-only functionality, such as ES SQL,
to fetch data. Fully configure your heatmap with flexible legend, axis,
and visual controls.

[float]
==== New filter panel
Use the new filter panel on any object to see which objects are filtering it.
This helps you author your workpad with the right behavior.

=== Visualizations

[float]
==== Combine fields with drag and drop

Combine multiple fields with drag and drop to see top combinations in Lens.
Use this feature to determine which combinations contribute to your metrics’ performance.

[float]
==== Top values by rarity

When looking for root cause, it is often useful to find rare values in your data.
Do this in Lens by seeing top values by rarity.
This takes advantage of the {es} rare terms aggregation and makes it easy to ask
“What’s not normal here?”

[float]
==== Horizontal and vertical gauges

The gauge visualization adds extra context to your metrics.
Show minimum and maximum values dynamically by using a quick function or custom formula,
or set a static value for known metric ranges. Include a goal value to see
if a metric is above or below the goal. Set color bands to show ranges visually&mdash;imilar
to reference lines in bar, line, and area visualizations. This new gauge visualization is
in technical preview in 8.1.

[float]
==== Mosaic visualization

The mosaic visualization, also known as marimekko or mekko, allows for side-by-side
comparison of two dimensions against a single metric. Treemaps and two-layered
pies do this as well, but the mosaic can be more effective for visual comparisons
by aligning the colors for the term side by side. Try this on low cardinality
dimensions to see its strengths. This new mosaic visualization is in technical preview in 8.1.

[float]
==== Waffle visualization

The waffle visualization is a proportion visualization that makes
more efficient use of space than pie charts.
Waffles are designed for square spaces, which aligns well with how
most dashboards are authored. Waffles are stronger for low cardinality breakdowns,
but are not recommended for very small partitions because they only can show
data in 1% blocks. You might be surprised how small you can make a waffle
visualization and maintain readability. This new waffle visualization is in technical preview in 8.1.

[float]
==== Color by value in metrics

Color the metric text or the background of the entire visualization
based on the value of the metric. Set up color stops for multiple colors similar
to what you can do in Lens tables, heatmaps, and the new gauge.

[float]
==== Table sort on dashboard view
Allow dashboard viewers to quickly change a table’s sort on the fly, like the editors can.

[float]
==== Filter formulas globally

This brings the familiar “Filter by” option for metrics defined by a formula.
With this feature it’s easy to filter all the parts of your formula with KQL
without having to copy or paste the KQL to all the aggregations used in the formula.

[float]
==== Configurable donut visualizations
The inner area size (or “donut hole”) in the donut
visualization is now configurable&mdash;keeping the default as a smaller size to maximize space for
labels but allowing you to change the option in Lens.

[float]
==== Collapsable suggestions panel

Get back some vertical space in Lens and save on the query cost of
suggestions by collapsing the suggestions panel. {kib} will remember if you close
your suggestions the next time you use the editor with the same browser.

[float]
==== Improved color controls

Revised color stop editing experience offers a more streamlined way to specify
what happens outside of the defined ranges (above and below the minimum and maximum).
These revised controls also add the ability to easily distribute color stops
evenly in one click. Look for this in Lens tables, heatmaps, metrics (new this release),
and gauges (new this release).

[float]
=== Maps

[float]
==== Shapefile upload
Effortlessly load shapefiles into Elastic with this simple but powerful uploader built
right into the *Maps* application. Easily load local open data and boundaries for analysis and comparison.

[float]
==== Vector tiles now the default
All new polygon layers now enable *Use vector tiles* by default.
Vector tiles offer the best performance and smooth
zooming over the alternative methods. You can change the scaling options
in layer settings if you prefer the previous approach.
