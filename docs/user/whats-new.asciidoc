=== Enhancements to Alerting

[discrete]
==== Add schedules for snoozing rule notifications

Starting in 8.2, you could suppress the notifications and actions for your rules
for a specific duration. Now you can also schedule these single or recurring
downtimes to start and end at specific dates and times.
