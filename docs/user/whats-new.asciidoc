=== Flexible analysis with temporary data views

Create temporary data views on the fly,
allowing you to explore and visualize your data before you’re ready to share your
insights with others in your organization. Add fields and create an {es} query alert,
just like you would a regular {data-source}. When you’re ready, you can save the {data-source}
for a fully collaborative experience. For more information, check <<data-views>>.
