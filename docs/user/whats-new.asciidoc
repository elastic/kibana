[[highlights-8.4-release-docs]]
=== Elastic release docs now in one place
With the new
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/new.html[Check out the latest from Elastic] page,
you can easily find all the latest information about Elastic features and updates
in a single location.
This includes release highlights, breaking changes, bug fixes, and more.

[[highlights-8.4-data-views]]
=== Meaningful data view names

You can now change the name of your data views, unique from the pattern of
indices they match. This allows you to give data views more meaningful names, making
them easier to find and manage.

The pattern is still visible via a tooltip.

[[highlights-8.4-visualization-editors]]
=== Visualization editors

[discrete]
==== Metric visualization

preview:[] The new Metric visualization in *Lens* supports a consistent
font sizing, allowing you to create more beautiful, multi-metric dashboards.
For additional context, you can add a Secondary metric, which is useful
for time shifts. Need to get multiple metrics arranged in a grid?
Add the Break down by field. To boost your customization options,
you can also include a range of values defined by a known static domain,
dynamic quick function, or a custom formula.

[discrete]
==== Rank by custom metrics
The new Rank by option in *Lens* allows you to rank your top values
by an additional custom metric.

[discrete]
==== Standard deviation quick function
This simple, but powerful, statistical summary helps you understand
more about how your metrics behave in *Lens*.

[discrete]
==== Drag and drop between layers
Itâ€™s now easier to work with multiple layers in *Lens*.
Drag and drop fields between your layers when they are coming from the same data view.

[discrete]
==== Custom ranges in number histograms
In *Lens*, you can now create custom ranges for your number histograms.
This helps you understand the domain of your data for when you want to
have a fixed set of histogram buckets.

[discrete]
==== Filter top values for specific terms
You can customize the *Lens* Top values function
to include or exclude specific terms. To filter for fields with multiple values,
you can choose to use this functionality over the global search.
This can help prevent you from accidentally filtering out too much data.

[discrete]
[[highlights-8.4-maps]]
=== Maps

[discrete]
==== Synchronize maps in dashboards
You can synchronize the maps on a dashboard,
so when you zoom or move in one map, all maps move together.
This enables you to see the same geo location for different data, accelerating
time-to-insights.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-maps-synchronize.png[Synchronize maps in a dashboard, width=75%]

[discrete]
==== Keyboard controls for zoom
Zoom in and out of maps using Shift+scroll instead of clicking the map options.
This makes maps more usable in dashboards, while also saving you time.

[role="screenshot"]

[discrete]
==== Filter by cluster
Filter your map by cluster with one click. Before 8.4, filtering was only possible
for individual documents.

[discrete]
==== Customize basemap color
Customize the color of your Elastic Basemaps to
adapt to your brand colors, or just to make it more beautiful and readable.

[discrete]
[[highlights-8.4-ml]]
=== Machine Learning

[discrete]
==== Inference threading parameters
When starting a trained model deployment, performance can be improved by
the threading parameters of `number of allocations` and `threads per allocation`.

Each allocation means the model gets another CPU thread for executing parallel
inference requests, so increasing the number of allocations increases the
throughput of all requests. In turn, threads per allocation sets the number of
threads used by each model allocation during inference,
so increasing this parameter improves the latency for each request.

From 8.4, you can set these two parameters in the UI when starting
a trained model deployment.

[discrete]
==== Log rate spikes in AIOps
Log spike analysis provides an on-demand option to quickly discover
possible root cause of a log rate increase. This option compares the data across
the other fields and values in the index and identifies which ones most
likely correlate to the spike in a recent baseline.

[discrete]
==== Data Visualizer chart optimized
The Data Visualizer now uses the
{ref}/search-aggregations-random-sampler-aggregation.html[random sampler aggregation]
when creating the document count histogram chart. The new sampling method ensures
that a sufficient sample size is used to draw the chart and calculate the
document count. Random sampling is on by default and automatically calculates
the optimal possibility. You can also set this manually or turn it off.

[discrete]
[[highlights-8.4-alerting]]
=== Alerting

[discrete]
==== Set query type for {es} query
You can now specify a KQL or Lucene query when building {es} query rules
in *Stack Management*.

[role="screenshot"]

[discrete]
==== {webhook-cm} connector

The new {kibana-ref}/cases-webhook-action-type.html[{webhook-cm} connector and action]
enable you to send POST, PUT, and GET requests to a case management RESTful API
web service. You can use this connector with cases in **{observability}**,
**{stack-manage-app}**, and **Elastic Security**.

[discrete]
==== Schedules for snoozing notifications

Starting in 8.2, you could suppress the notifications and actions for your rules
for a specific duration. In 8.4, you can also schedule these single or recurring
downtimes to start and end at specific dates and times.

[role="screenshot"]

[discrete]
==== New metrics for rules and actions

You can now ship metrics related to {alert-features} to your monitoring cluster
by using {agent} or {metricbeat}. Click *Overview* and *Instances* in the
{kib} section of *{stack-monitor-app}* to see visualizations about the rules and
actions that are queued, running, or failing.

[discrete]
[[highlights-8.4-console]]
=== Console

[discrete]
==== Comments in request body

Ever look at a massive request body and struggle to recall why you configured
it that way? In 8.4, you can write comments inside the request body and
leave yourself notes about its configuration. You can even comment out specific
lines to temporarily disable them and try out other variations of the request.

[discrete]
==== Variable definitions

You can now define variables in Console and reuse them in your requests.
You can refer to variables in the paths and bodies of your requests, as many times as you like.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-console-variables.png[What it looks like to define variables and consume them in a request in Console]

[discrete]
==== HTTP status badges

Each response now includes an HTTP status badge. This makes it easier
to tell which request failed and which succeeded. The most severe status is
at the top of the UI, so you can quickly get a sense of whether any of
your requests had trouble.
