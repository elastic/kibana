[[customizable-header-7-12]]
=== Custom global header

Whether you have multiple {kib} instances running for different environments,
need to provide some additional context for accreditation purposes, or simply
want to customize {kib}, you can now add your own header.
For more details on how to
configure a global header, view the configuration settings.
Customizable headers are a https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription feature].

[float]
[[search-sessions-7-12]]
=== Search sessions for background search

Increasing data volumes and tiered storage systems mean some searches
take a little longer. When searching frozen indices or using cold storage,
there is no reason to sit and wait. {kib} now has search sessions, which
give you control when {es} needs more time to complete a search.

Search sessions are groups of queries, from a dashboard for example,
that run in the background for as long as needed.
You can save a search session in *Dashboard* or *Discover*,
close the browser window, and then come back once your searches are complete.
A view of your managed search sessions is in *Stack Management*.

[float]
[[dashboard-7-12]]
=== New flow for creating dashboards

Creating dashboards is now quicker and easier with the new streamlined navigation
between apps. We’re thinking dashboard-first, making it easier to create new
visualizations and add them in place, without interrupting the dashboard building process.
For more information about this new workflow, refer to {kibana-ref}/dashboard.html[Dashboard].

[float]
==== Visualize Library

Visualize is now **Visualize Library** to reflect its new function as the
home for all of your saved panels.

[float]
==== Copy to dashboard

Have a panel that you want to instantly copy to a new or existing dashboard?
Now you can right from the panel menu.

[float]
==== Quick save

We’ve added a *Save* option to the toolbar so that you can quickly
save a dashboard without adding a title first. To pick up where you left off,
simply navigate back to *Dashboard*.

[float]
[[runtime-fields-7-12]]
=== Runtime fields in Discover

Runtime fields are now available in *Discover*&mdash;view them like any other field.
Refer to the {ref}/runtime.html[runtime fields] documentation for more information.

[float]
[[alerting-7-12]]
=== {es} query alert

The new {kibana-ref-all}/7.12/alert-type-es-query.html[{es} query alert] allows you
to create alerts using {ref}/query-dsl.html[DSL queries].
Use this alert with any of your indices and get alerted on the number of matching documents.
The {es} query alert is especially good for
advanced use cases where you want to create custom alerts with custom DSL queries.

[float]
[[maps-7-12]]
=== Maps&mdash;alerts and labels

[float]
[[tracking-alert-7-12]]
==== Location-based alerts now GA

The {kibana-ref}/geo-alerting.html[tracking containment alert] allows you to monitor an entity’s
location as it relates to a boundary, triggering a notification while contained,
or when entering or leaving a boundary. Also known
as “geo-fencing”, this feature is common for tracking
the movement of devices, such as
vehicles within a fleet. The tracking containment alert is a
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription feature].

[float]
==== Labels for polygons and lines

Adding labels to polygons and lines gives anyone working with your map
the right context for analysis.

[float]
[[drilldowns-7-12]]
=== URL drilldowns generally available

URL drilldowns, which enable you to navigate from a dashboard to internal or external URLs,
is now generally available. For more information,
refer to {kibana-ref}/drilldowns.html#url-drilldowns[URL drilldowns].


[float]
[[lens-7-12]]
=== Lens&mdash;functions, interactions, and improvements

[float]
==== New functions

*Lens* now supports even more functions to meet your visualization needs,
including percentiles, cumulative sum, moving average, counter rate, and differences.
To give the new functions a try, take a look at the new <<create-a-dashboard-of-panels-with-ecommerce-data,Lens tutorial>>.

[float]
==== New drag and drop interactions

To significantly speed up the visualization creation process, we added a
fully accessible drag and drop system in *Lens*. For more information, refer to <<lens,*Lens*>>.

[float]
==== Table improvements
To customize the data table in *Lens*, we’ve implemented several customization options,
including column resize, text alignment, and the ability to hide columns.

[float]
[[machine-learning-7-12]]
=== Machine Learning&mdash;alerts, geo data, and more

[float]
[[anomaly-alert-7-12]]
==== {anomaly-detect-cap} alerts (beta)

This release provides more flexible, more intuitive, easier to set-up alerting for {anomaly-detect}.
{anomaly-detect-cap} alerts are integrated with the {kib} alerting framework,
so you can quickly create alerts for your {anomaly-jobs}. This new type of alert can be created
for existing jobs from the *Alerts* page under *Stack Management* or from the {ml} job list,
or at the end of the *Anomaly Detection* job wizard.

You can pick the type of results
you want to be alerted on, depending on whether you are interested in the overall anomaly score for the job,
individual anomalies, or entities behaving unusually over time. The new alert type replaces
the current {ml} integration with *Watcher*.

[float]
==== {ml-cap} integration with Maps

This integration enables you to view geographic data inside the {ml-cap} app and
anomaly data inside *Maps*. The redesigned *Data Visualizer* shows the distribution of
values for geo_point field types.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/images/highlights-ml-maps.png[Machine learning integration with Maps]

For jobs that use the {ml-docs}/ml-geo-functions.html#ml-lat-long[lat_long] function to detect anomalies in the geographic location
of the input data, the *Anomaly Explorer* shows the actual and typical locations on maps.

[float]
==== AUC ROC visualization for classification jobs

Performance measurement is an essential part of {ml}, and for classification models,
the {ml-docs}/ml-dfanalytics-evaluate.html#ml-dfanalytics-class-aucroc[AUC ROC] (Area Under the Curve of Receiver Operating Characteristics) is one of the most
important evaluation metrics for checking model performance. You can view the ROC
curve in the data frame analytics job results in {kib}. The AUC value is calculated from this curve,
as a number between 0 and 1. A higher value means the model is more precise in predicting the class correctly.
