=== Security on-by-default

Authentication, authorization, and multi-tenancy
with {kib} Spaces are enabled by default, with almost no configuration effort.
When you run {kib} for the first time, you'll be presented with a new interactive
UI that will help you set up {kib} and connect it to a secured {es} cluster.
Simply paste the enrollment token that you received when you ran
{es}, and {kib} will set up all {stack} security features
and connect {es} over TLS.

=== Index patterns are now data views
Renaming index patterns to data views creates the foundation for building
new and exciting features in {kib}. Your data views will work
exactly as index patterns did in previous releases.

=== Maps updates vector tiles & basemaps

Elastic is offering full vector tile support, generally available, in {kib} *Maps*.

The default basemaps in light and dark themes now use
the more understated desaturated basemap. This gives your data the most
visual attention.

=== Discover has field statistics (beta)

Enable the new {kibana-ref}/show-field-statistics.html[*Field statistics*] view
for a summary of all fields (or just selected fields) in your data.
You'll find interesting fields to visualize and learn more about the shape of your data.
The *Field statistics* view
is similar to the Index Data Visualizer in {ml-app}.

=== Multi-layered time axis redesigned
The time axis was upgraded across {kib} to solve key readability and
formatting issues. This redesign affects *Lens*, *TSVB*,
aggregation-based visualizations, and *Discover*.
This multi-layered format enables you to create easier to understand visualizations from your data

create elements and visualizations.

Canvas also has these features similar to *Dashboard*.

* You can create embedded visualizations in your *Canvas* workpads.
Promote favorites to the *Visualization Library* for re-use.

* Editing a visualization from *Canvas* will return you to *Canvas* when you
click *Save and close*. Fewer clicks to author
and edit existing presentations.
