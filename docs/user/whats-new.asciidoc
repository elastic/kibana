=== Upgrade Assistant for 8.x

*Upgrade Assistant* is your one-stop shop to help you prepare for upgrading to 8.x.
Review and address {es} and {kib} deprecation issues, analyze {es} deprecation logs,
migrate system indices, and back up your data before upgrading, all from this app.

=== Unified integrations view

All ingest options for Elastic have been moved to a single *Integrations* view.
This provides a more consistent experience for onboarding to Elastic and increases
the discoverability of integrations.
All entry points for adding integrations now route to this page.

=== Reference lines in Lens

Reference lines are now available in *Lens* to help you easily identify
important values in your visualizations. Create reference lines with static
values, dynamic data using {es} *Quick Functions*, or define with a
custom *Formula*. Reference lines can come from separate index patterns,
such as a goal dataset that is independent of the source data.

With reference lines, you can:

* Track metrics against goals, warning zones, and more.
* Add display options, such as color, icons, and labels.
* Apply color to the area above or below the reference line.

=== Enhancements to visualization editors

{kib} offers even more ways to work with your visualizations:

* *Apply custom field formats in TSVB.*
Take advantage of the field formatters from your index pattern in
*TSVB*&mdash;or override the format for a specific visualization.
* *Filter in TSVB.*
You always had the ability to ignore global filters in *TSVB* layers,
and now you can also change them. This makes it easier to explore your data
in *TSVB* without having to edit the filters for each series.
* *View data and requests in Lens.*
View the data in visualizations and the requests that collected the data right in the *Lens* editor.
* *View requests in Console.*
View the requests that collect the data in visualizations in *Console*.
* *Auto fit rows to content.*
Automatically resize *Aggregation-based* data table rows so that text and images are fully visible.

=== New and updated connectors in Alerting

Alerting has grown its collection of connectors with the addition of the ServiceNow ITOM
connector, which allows for easy integration with ServiceNow event management. In addition,
{kib} provides a more efficient integration for ServiceNow ITSM and SecOps connectors
with certified applications on the ServiceNow store. Also added
is the ability to authenticate the email connector with OAuth 2.0
Client Credentials for the MS Exchange email service.

=== Rule duration on display

In *Rules and Connectors*, the *Rules* view now includes the rule duration field, which shows how long a rule is taking to
complete execution. This helps you identify rules that run longer than you anticipate.

You can observe the duration for the last 30 executions
on the rules detail page.
