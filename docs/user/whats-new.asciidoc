[[navigation-7-8]]
=== Side navigation organized by use cases

{kib} has a cleaner, more organized side navigation
for getting you where you need to go. For example, when you're
ready to work with your logs, metrics, APM, or Uptime data,
you'll find the apps you need under *Observability*.
The side navigation also includes
*Recently viewed* to easily
access previously opened apps.

Hidden by default, the sidebar is accessible
with a single click on the hamburger menu.  Use the *Dock Navigation* link
at the bottom of the sidebar to keep the navigation visible.

[[dashboard-first-7-8]]
=== Dashboard-first experience

In 7.7, {kibana-ref}/dashboard-create-new-dashboard.html[dashboards] became a starting point for
creating visualizations.
Building on that experience, this release introduces a simplified workflow
for editing a dashboard.
You can now open the visualization editor directly from the dashboard, and then
automatically return to the dashboard when you save the changes.
This workflow keeps you focused on analyzing the data.

[[dashboard-to-dashboard-7-8]]
=== Dashboard-to-dashboard drilldowns

With 7.8, {kib} delivers {kibana-ref}/drilldowns.html[drilldowns], which enable you to create
custom navigation paths between dashboards. Drilldowns
work well when you have multiple dashboards that support different audiences
or provide different levels of analysis. For example, you might
have a dashboard that shows the overall status of multiple data centers,
and then create a drilldown that navigates to a dashboard for a single data center.
Drilldown paths are available to all users who view the dashboard.

[[dashboard-clone-7-8]]
=== Cloning of dashboard elements
{kib} now lets you {kibana-ref}/dashboard-create-new-dashboard.html#cloning-a-panel[create an identical copy] of
any panel on the dashboard.
You can modify the visualization in the new panel as needed, and then save your changes.
Cloning enables you to quickly view your data from a
new perspective.

[[lens-7-8]]
=== New visualizations for Lens

{kibana-ref}/lens.html[Lens] introduces three new visualization types: pie chart, donut chart, and treemap.  New
to {kib}, treemaps provide a hierarchical view of your data and are good for visualizing part-to-whole relationships.

[[canvas-7-8]]
=== Menu updates for Canvas

{kibana-ref}/lens.html[Canvas] has a new top-level menu that makes it easier for
you to find the options to create, customize, and share your workpads.

[[maps-7-8]]
=== Dedicated solution layer for Maps

{kibana-ref}/maps.html[Maps] has a new Observability layer that supports real user monitoring (RUM) data.
You're presented with the Observability option if you have APM indices
in the {ecs-ref}/ecs-reference.html[Elastic Common Schema].
You can then select either
APM RUM Performance or APM RUM Traffic, and Maps
overlays that layer on your geoanalysis.

[[ingest-node-pipeline-7-8]]
=== Ingest Node Pipelines builder

Ingesting data into the Elastic Stack
is easier with the new {kibana-ref}/ingest-node-pipelines.html[Ingest Node Pipelines builder].
This UI shows all your
data piplelines in a single view and enables you to drill down into details.
You can create a pipeline and define the tasks it performs, such
as renaming an existing field or setting a new field.
You can also test how a pipeline and its processors
transform data before putting it into production.

[[alerting-7-8]]
=== Preconfigured connectors for alerting

In 7.7, {kib} introduced a new system for handing alerts, and this release adds support for
{kibana-ref}/pre-configured-action-types-and-connectors.html[preconfigured connectors], which
automatically start up with {kib}.
This capability enables you to pre-plumb alert connections
directly into Slack channels and designated email services.
Preconfigured connectors are available in every {kib} space, and require no additional
configuration after initialization.

[[embed-swim-lanes-7-8]]
=== Embeddable machine learning swim lanes

In 7.8, you can view anomalies alongside your source data in a {kib} dashboard
with embedded swim lanes. From the *Add panel* menu, you can select the jobs of
interest, decide whether to view an overall score or split by job or influencer,
and choose the number of lanes to display.

[[file-upload-7-8]]
=== Increased limit for file upload

The upload limit for the File Data Visualizer increased from 100 MB to 1 GB,
so you can now upload larger CSV, JSON, and log files.
To configure this value, go to
{kibana-ref}/advanced-options.html#kibana-ml-settings[Advanced Settings].

[[logon-7-8]]
=== Customization of login experience

Kibana now offers two ways to customize the login experience.
Before starting {kib}, you can show a screen specific to your requirements,
for example, if users must agree to
certain terms and conditions.
You can also modify the login screen:
edit the text for password hints, customize the icons for SSO options,
and add messages and prompts.
