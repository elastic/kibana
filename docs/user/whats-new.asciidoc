==== Data views &mdash; use without saving

What if you could explore your data or create a visualization without first creating a {data-source}?
Now you can do just that by selecting *Use without saving* in the *Create {data-source}* form.
This enables you to quickly explore your data in *Discover*, *Lens*, and *Maps*
right after ingesting it.
You can save the {data-source} later
if you create a search or visualization that you want to share.

[[highlights-8.5-discover]]
=== Discover

==== Resize the date histogram

In addition to toggling the display of the histogram, you can now change its height.
Your preferences are saved locally in your browser.

[discrete]
==== More insights in fields list

The field popover in the *Available fields* list now shows
more data, making it similar to the field popovers in *Lens* and *Fields Statistics*:

* Statistics are based on a sample of 5000 records per shard. Previously the sample size was 500 records.
* The popover shows up to top 10 values, instead of just 5.
* The “exist” filter appears at the top of the popover for better visibility.
* The distribution of values is available for aggregatable fields.

[[highlights-8.5-dashboard]]
=== Dashboard

[discrete]
==== New time slider control

Add the newest control for interacting with your dashboard data, the time slider control.
The time slider allows anyone viewing the dashboard to playback and scrub through the data by time,
or quickly view the data for a specific time range, just like a song or movie.

==== Filters for panels

When filters are applied to the individual visualization panels on your dashboard,
you can now easily view them without opening the visualization editor and leaving the dashboard.
Simply click *Panel filters* in the header.

[[highlights-8.5-vis-editors]]
=== Lens visualization editor

[discrete]
==== Add query-based annotations

A key method of troubleshooting metric performance is to analyze the events
that take place at the same time. Now you can add query-based annotations from multiple
data sources to your *Lens* visualizations. This makes it easy to layer time series events
and view the relationships between the annotations and other metrics.
Query-based annotations also come with improved overflow support, additional style options, and a customizable tooltip.

==== Turn table values into links

Visual cues are important to dashboard users, especially when it comes to clickable values.
With the Table visualization in *Lens*, you can now enable *Directly filter on click* to turn
any column value into a link that filters the data, or drills down into the data.

==== Clone visualization layers

When you create visualization layers in *Lens*, you don’t have to start from a blank slate.
You can now duplicate layers, making it easy to adjust the filters and data options
from a common starting point.

[discrete]
==== Normalize by unit

Need to use *Normalize by unit* for more than just date histogram visualizations in *Lens*?
Now you can! Suppose you have a metric visualization that displays the count of the
records field. With *Normalize by unit*, you can view a per minute calculation of the field.

[discrete]
==== Display the current time

Markers make it easy for anyone viewing your dashboard to quickly understand important
events on visualizations. With the new *Show current time marker* axis option,
you can add a red line to signify where “now” is on time series visualizations.

[discrete]
==== Collapse by option

Let’s say you’re creating a partition chart with sampled data, such as metrics,
and want to break down the last values from each reporting dimension, such as hosts.
You can use the new *Collapse by* option to break down and summarize the
result of each last value from hosts without displaying the detailed reporting dimension.

[[highlights-8.5-maps]]
=== Maps &mdash; hide tooltips

Tooltips display when you hover over a document or cluster in a map.
Don't want to display them? Turn them off with
the new *Show tooltips* toggle in *Layer settings*.

[[highlights-8.5-machine-learning]]
=== Machine Learning

[discrete]
==== Anomaly detection jobs from Lens

You can now create anomaly detection jobs from the flyout of a *Lens* visualization.
Enter a job ID before creating the job, so it starts automatically after saving.
For a more advanced configuration, follow the link that takes you to the ML job wizard.

[discrete]
==== Log pattern analysis

You can now select a data view and message field,
apply optional filters, and then run on-demand categorization analysis.
Messages that are similar are grouped using the same underlying algorithms
as a machine learning categorization job. The distribution of the documents in each category
are highlighted on the main chart. You can then open *Discover*,
use one or more of these categories as a filter to view the matching documents,
and continue your investigation.

[discrete]
==== Locations of anomalous results in Maps

This release adds a link to *Maps* in the *Anomaly Explorer* and *Single Metric Viewer*
for any anomalies where the source data contains geo fields,
even if the analysis does not use the location field directly.
View the anomaly on the map by following the link.
For example, view the location of a client making an unusually high number of
requests that failed with a `page not found` 404 error.

[discrete]
[[highlights-8.5-security]]
=== Access agreement enhanced

The {kibana-ref}/xpack-security-access-agreement.html[access agreement]
now allows admins to set a default access
agreement message that applies to all authentication providers.
If you set the new `xpack.security.accessAgreement.message` setting, it will apply to all providers
for which you do not specify an access agreement.

[discrete]
[[highlights-8.5-collaboration]]
=== Collaboration with Cases

[discrete]
==== Case assignment

This release adds the ability to assign a {kibana-ref}/cases.html[case] to users.
You can do so either while creating a case or in an existing case by using
the “assignees” UI in *Observability*, *Elastic Security*, and *Stack Management*.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-cases-assignees.png[Collaborate with Cases UI]

You can assign one or more users (and unassign as needed).
The UI builds on previous releases, which introduced the ability for users
to customize their avatars by selecting an image or color.
Avatars add visual help in easily identifying and disambiguating users.

The assignees and their avatars show up in each case.
They also now appear in the central *Cases* view that lists all existing
cases in *Observability*, *Elastic Security*, and *Stack Management*.
On this view, you can easily filter through the cases assigned to you and all other users.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-cases-view.png[Cases view listing that lists all assigned users]

[discrete]
==== User search

You can now search for users by their full name,
username, or email as part of the case assignment flow.
{kib} users from all authentication realms are searchable. On first access,
{kib} creates a user profile and surfaces it in the user search results.

The user search UI includes auto-complete and search highlights.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/highlights-cases-user-search.png[User search view with auto-complete, highlights, user avatars, user email, width="75%"]

User search adheres to {kib} role-based access control. Users who do not have access to *Cases* within the
space will not surface in the results. For more details, go to {kibana-ref}/setup-cases.html[Configure access to cases].
