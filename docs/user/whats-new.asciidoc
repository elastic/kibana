[[new-home-and-landing-page]]
=== New home and landing page

With so many exciting additions to {kib}, it can be challenging to choose a
path forward. As a result, we have a renewed focus on the initial user experience,
beginning with a new home page.
This new version focuses on core solutions and use cases.

Extending from the home page, you're now guided toward solution-focused
landing pages that assist in adding data and introducing underlying capabilities.
These new pages help users, both new and experienced, get started with all that {kib} has to offer.

[[stack-header-and-navigational-search]]
=== Stack header and navigational search

In 7.8, we introduced a new and improved main menu as part of our
quest for the optimal navigation design.
In 7.10, we’ve revealed more of the picture, with the
addition of a global header that includes a
navigational search feature.
Using a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+/ on Windows and Linux; Command+/ on MacOS),
you can now jump between applications and saved objects,
including dashboards, visualizations, workpads, saved searches, and more.

[[drilldowns-to-urls]]
=== Drilldowns to URLs (beta)

In 7.8, we introduced a dashboard-to-dashboard drilldown that lets you quickly create
custom navigation paths between dashboards, carrying over the filter and
time context. Now you can create a navigation path from a dashboard to an internal or external
URL.
This functionality is in beta and is available with a https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Gold subscription] and higher.
For more information, refer to the {kibana-ref}/url-drilldown.html[URL drilldown documentation].

[[lens-generally-available]]
=== Lens generally available

To further our commitment to the ongoing journey of making {kib} an incredible
visual data analytics experience for everyone, regardless of technical background,
*Lens* is generally available. Now users whose companies limit the use of
beta software or services in production can leverage the visualization and analytics
capabilities that Lens provides.

[float]
==== New chart types

Let *Lens* build visualizations of your data with new chart types.
Depending on the type of data you are visualizing, *Lens* can now build
percentage bar charts and percentage area charts.
For more information, refer to the {kibana-ref}/dashboard.html#lens[documentation].

[float]
[[hiding-management]]
=== Hide management based on privileges

*Stack Management* is home to an ever-growing suite of administrative
tools to help manage your stack. These tools have historically been visible to
all users, even if they weren’t authorized to take advantage of them. Now,
*Stack Management* only shows the features that end users are authorized to use,
based on their assigned {ref}/security-privileges.html[cluster and index privileges].
If a user isn’t authorized
to see any of the *Stack Management* features, then the entire
*Stack Management* is hidden.

This highly-requested feature allows administrators to use {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html#kibana-feature-privileges[feature privileges]
instead of the deprecated Dashboard-only mode,
which will be removed in 8.0. We also updated
{kibana-ref}/management.html[our documentation] to make
sure the set of required cluster and index privileges are clearly defined
for each *Stack Management* feature.

[[copy-and-import-objects]]
=== Copy and import saved objects

While laying the groundwork for sharing saved objects in multiple spaces,
we overhauled the UI for copying and importing saved objects.
When copying saved objects, you now have the option to create new objects,
can more easily resolve conflicts, and use the flyout for more helpful information,
including subtotals, object icons, and object titles.
After importing saved objects, you’ll see a summary of what objects were created.

[[maps-enhancements]]
=== Maps

Sometimes the little things make the biggest impact. In 7.10, you can now use
*Maps* with drilldowns. When authoring a dashboard, you can create a map,
save, and return to a dashboard in the flow, and while using maps,
automatically fitting “data to bounds” is the new default&mdash;keeping your
data at the center of attention.

Speaking of your data, it’s now easier to work with if it’s coming from a CSV.
Using the file upload in *Machine Learning*, when importing latitude and longitude fields
from CSV, you now get a geo_point field automatically.



[float]
[[machine-learning-enhancements]]
=== Enhancements to Machine learning

[float]
==== Data frame analytics model management

Enhancing the functionality for data frame analytics supervised learning,
you can manage the trained models under **Machine Learning**. The new tab lists
basic information on each model, with more detailed information displayed on
row expansion including the inference and job configuration and stats. It also
contains a list of which ingest pipelines are making use of each model.
Additional controls allow you to search and delete models, and to view the training
data used to create each model.

[float]
==== Per-partition categorization

Categorization tokenizes a text field, clusters similar data together,
classifies it into categories, then detects anomalous categories in the data.
From 7.9, per-partition categorization enables you to do categorization separately
for every value of a partition field. Now it is possible to configure per-partition
categorization in **Machine Learning**.

[float]
==== Feature importance

When you examine the results from your {classification} or {regression} {ml} jobs,
you can use {feat-imp} to understand which fields had the biggest impact
on each prediction. In 7.10, you can see the average magnitude of the {feat-imp}
values for each field across all the training data.

[role="screenshot"]
image::user/images/feature-importance.png[Feature importance]

You can also examine the feature importance values for each individual
prediction in the format of JSON objects or decision plots.



[float]
[[vega-generally-available]]
=== Vega generally available

*Vega*, an advanced editor you use to create custom panels in dashboards, is production ready.
Now users whose companies limit the use of beta software or services in production can leverage the full visualization customization capabilities that Vega provides.
For information about Vega, refer to the {kibana-ref}/dashboard.html#vega[*Vega* documentation].
