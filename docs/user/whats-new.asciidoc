=== Upgrade Assistant for 8.x

Upgrade Assistant is your one-stop shop to help you prepare for upgrading to 8.x.
Review and address {es} and {kib} deprecation issues, analyze {es} deprecation logs,
migrate system indices, and back up your data before upgrading, all from within this app.

=== Unified integrations view

All ingest options for Elastic have been moved to the *Integrations* view.
This provides a more consistent experience for onboarding to Elastic and increases
the discoverability of integrations by providing all of them in a single view.
Any entry points for adding integrations now route to this page.

=== Reference lines in Lens

Reference lines are base lines bound to a metric axis of your visualization.
These lines allow you to track metrics against goals, warning zones, and any other
meaningful area of a metric’s range. You can do a lot with reference lines:

* Create reference lines from static values, from dynamic data using Elasticsearch Quick Functions, or define from a custom formula.
* Style your reference line’s color, stroke width, line style, and thickness.
* Include an icon and show the display name to make it easy to quickly communicate the reference line’s meaning.
* Color the area above or below the reference line to make it easy to identify the meaning of this area.
If you use multiple lines on the same axis, the color will go until the next reference line to
help establish different areas of metric performance.

Reference lines can come from separate {kib} index patterns, such as a goal dataset that is independent of the source data.

=== Enhancements to visualization editors

{kib} now offers even more ways to work with your visualizations:

* *Custom field formats in TSVB*.
Take advantage of the field formatters from your index pattern in
TSVB&mdash;or override the format for a specific visualization with new options.
* *Filter bar in TSVB.*
TSVB layers have always had the ability to ignore global filters but now,
from the TSVB editor, you can directly modify those global filters.
* *Inspector in Lens.*
Inspect your data and requests from within the *Lens* editor.
* *Inspector requests in Console.*
Open the Inspector and click a button to view the inspected request in Console.
This makes it easier to explore your data in TSVB without having to edit each series’ filters separately.
* Auto fit rows to content.  This feature is now available in non-legacy data tables.

==== New and updated connectors

Alerting has grown its collection of connectors with the addition of the ServiceNow ITOM
connector, for easy integration with ServiceNow event management. In addition to ITOM,
{kib} provides a more efficient integration for ServiceNow ITSM and SecOps connectors
with certified applications on the ServiceNow store. Another enhancement to
connectors is the ability to authenticate the email connector with OAuth 2.0
Client Credentials for the MS Exchange email service.

==== Rule duration on display

In *Rules and Connectors*, the *Rules* view now includes the rule duration field, which shows how long a rule is taking to
complete execution. This helps you identify rules that run longer than you might anticipate.

On the rule details page, you can observe the duration for the last 30 executions.
