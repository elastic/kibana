=== Discover: Break down the histogram by value
In *Discover*,
you can now resize the histogram and break down fields by value,
which is often used for logs exploration. The updated histogram is especially useful for
*Observability* use cases. For more information, check {kibana-ref}/discover.html[Discover].

=== Lens: Convert your visualizations
Convert your TSVB and aggregation-based visualizations to the drag-and-drop *Lens* visualization editor,
directly from your dashboards. In *Edit* mode, the TSVB and aggregation-based dashboard panels
that display a dot support the *Convert to Lens* functionality.
For more information, check {kibana-ref}/tsvb.html#edit-visualizations-in-lens[Open and edit TSVB visualizations in Lens]
and

=== Dashboard

[discrete]
==== Time slider updates
Selecting just the right time range is now even easier with the improvements to the time slider control.
Pin the start time to the beginning of your time range to show how data builds over a period of time. For more information, check {kibana-ref}/add-controls.html[Filter dashboard data with controls].

[discrete]
==== Complex filters
preview:[] Create and apply multiple filters simultaneously for nested queries,
and use the logical OR and AND operators using the improved dropdown menu experience. For more information, check {kibana-ref}/kibana-concepts-analysts.html#autocomplete-suggestions[Additional filters with AND].

[discrete]
==== Interactive chart filters

Filtering your data just got easier with interactive chart filters. When you right-click your chart data,
you can select one or more filter values from the menu that appears, and link the filters with the OR operator.

=== Maps

[discrete]
==== Label positioning

Use the new *Label position* style setting to position labels above, below, or in the center of markers and icons.

[discrete]
==== Hexagon clustering

Hexagon clustering was added to {kib} 8.2, but only for geo_point fields.
This release extends support for hexagon clustering to include geo_shape fields.

[discrete]
==== Controls time slider

The *Maps* time slider now uses the controls time slider, which includes enhancements
such as pinning the start time. Refer
to {kibana-ref}/add-controls.html[Controls] for details.

[discrete]
=== Machine Learning

[discrete]
==== Natural language processing (NLP)

In 8.7, the NLP capabilities of the Elastic product became generally available.
Deploy and manage your trained NLP models to perform tasks,
such as text classification (including zero-shot), question answering, named entity recognition, and more.
Refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-overview.html[Natural language processing]
for details.


[discrete]
==== Anomaly detection jobs on geo data

A new geo wizard is available for creating lat_long anomaly detection jobs. This makes it easier
to create jobs to detect anomalies in the geographic location of your input data.

[role="screenshot"]

A new action enables you to quickly create anomaly detection jobs from map visualizations.
You can create the jobs directly from a flyout in *Dashboard*.
For a more advanced configuration, follow the link that takes you to the ML job wizard.

[discrete]
==== Memory usage by machine learning jobs

Beginning in 8.7, you can view the memory usage of the open anomaly detection jobs
and the started data frame analytics jobs in the *Memory Usage* view.
This new view displays the total and available memory of your ML nodes,
the memory usage of the deployed trained models,
and active machine learning jobs.

[discrete]
==== Change point detection in AIOps Labs

preview:[] Change point detection identifies distribution changes, dips, spikes, and other
statistically significant change points in a metric. The *Change point detection* UI
visualizes the change points in a bucket identified by the change point aggregation.

[discrete]
==== Field statistics in machine learning job and transform wizards

You are now able to view the statistics of the selectable fields in the anomaly detection,
the data frame analytics, and the transforms wizards. The field statistics
provide more meaningful context to help you select relevant fields.

=== Alerting

[discrete]
==== Alert flapping detection

Flapping occurs when the state of monitored assets, such as services, change too frequently,
resulting in multiple alerts that might distract you from more important issues.
To reduce the time to respond (MTTR), you can now identify frequent changes
in your monitored assets by using pre-built configurations, highlighting alerts in the UI,
and suppressing related notifications. For more information, check <<create-and-manage-rules>>.

[discrete]
==== Alert action summarization

Currently, alert actions are triggered when the rule runs or when the alert status changes.
This behavior might lead to a notification storm when an alerting rule detects a high cardinality of alerts.
These situations increase the time to respond to each event and affect the overall MTTR.
With the new alert actions summarization feature, you can define how
to aggregate several actions into a single one with these options:

* *Summary of alerts on check intervals* For example, all the alerts that are
detected by the same rule run will be sent in a single notification.
* *Summary of alerts on custom action intervals*
For example, all the alerts that are detected in the last 10 hours will be sent in a single email.

This feature aims to improve the way you consume notifications from third parties
and improve the MTTR by reducing unnecessary noise.
For more information, check <<alerting-getting-started>>.

==== New actions in Case management

The *Case* table view streamlines case management with these new actions:

* More sorting and filtering options (by severity, status, last updates, and more)
* Bulk action for maintaining case assignees

[discrete]
==== New connector log

A new connector log is available for you to troubleshoot connector
behaviors and react when something goes wrong.

[discrete]
==== Bulk action for enabling rules

A new bulk action for enabling and disabling rules is now supported in the *Rule* table view.

[discrete]
=== {kib} Security

[discrete]
==== Control concurrent user sessions

Administrators can now control the number of concurrent user sessions by configuring
a limit through the `maxSessions` setting, for increased security. Once the limit is reached,
a newly created user session will displace the oldest one (by creating a timestamp) for the same user.

[discrete]
==== {kib} audit logging enhanced

Since its introduction, the {kibana-ref}/xpack-security-audit-logging.html[{kib} audit logging] has been enhanced with
additional data of security audit interest. This release adds the client IP address field.
