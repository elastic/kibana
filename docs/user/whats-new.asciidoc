=== Machine learning

[discrete]
==== {transform-cap} ‘schedule now’ action added to UI

The {transform} UI has been updated to make use of the _schedule_now 
functionality. This schedules a {transform} to instantly process new data 
without waiting for the configured interval between checks for changes in the 
source indices. It is a useful operation for {transforms} with a longer 
frequency setting where the {transform} can be activated to update directly 
after data has been uploaded. The feature can be used on individual {transforms} 
as well as a bulk action on multiple.

==== ELSER configuration on the Trained Models UI

Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR – or ELSER – is a {ml} model newly added to the
library. ELSER improves your search relevance by enabling you to perform 
semantic search; a search type that operates on the meaning of words and does 
not search only on literal terms. The Trained Models UI enables you to easily 
download and deploy the model in your cluster and use ELSER in an {infer} 
pipeline or a text expansion query.

==== Change point detection - multiple metrics and split fields

Change point detection was introduced in 8.7 as part of AIOps Labs. In 8.8, it 
supports multiple change point configurations which enables you to view data 
from different metrics and partitions in a table layout with change point 
previews. It accommodates more results on a single page, provides more sorting 
possibilities, and makes it possible to zoom in on particular entries.
It has updated controls for the metric and split fields which provides easy 
access to the top values and distribution of the configuring field.
The quick filter action simplifies the investigation of certain partitions or 
excluding them from the analysis.

==== Log pattern analysis in Discover

The AIOps feature for log pattern analysis has been added to Discover and it is 
available for any text field. It can be accessed from the field selection left 
panel for a natural troubleshooting workflow. This provides a great experience 
for navigating log data by being able to filter out the noisy messages or filter 
in on the more important, actionable data.

==== {dfanalytics-cap} drilldown actions

From 8.8, the results data grid provides a link under the Actions column to 
Discover filtering for the row's field/values.
Creating custom URLs for jobs is also supported from the jobs list. You can 
create a link to {kib} Discover, {kib} Dashboards, or an external URL. You can 
also test the configured custom URL.

the time filter, and dashboard options.

=== Maps has metric filtering

Use metric filtering to hide aggregation buckets to reduce clutter and highlight areas of interest.

For example, this map shows web traffic clusters. Areas with more traffic are obscured by areas with little traffic.

Now, the map has less visual clutter and it’s easy to visualize areas with high web traffic,
allowing the marketing team to better target high value areas.
