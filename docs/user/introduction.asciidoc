<titleabbrev>What is Kibana?</titleabbrev>
++++

**_Explore and visualize your data and manage all things Elastic Stack._**

Whether you’re a user or admin, {kib} makes your data actionable by providing
three key functions. Kibana is:

* **An open-source analytics and visualization platform.**
Use {kib} to explore your {es} data, and then build beautiful visualizations and dashboards.

* **A UI for managing the Elastic Stack.**
Manage your security settings, assign user roles, take snapshots, roll up your data,
and more &mdash; all from the convenience of a {kib} UI.

* **A centralized hub for Elastic's solutions.** From log analytics to
document discovery to SIEM, {kib} is the portal for accessing these and other capabilities.

[[get-data-into-kibana]]
=== Get data into {kib}

{kib} is designed to use {es} as a data source. Think of Elasticsearch as the engine that stores
and processes the data, with {kib} sitting on top.

{kib} offers multiple ways to get data in:

* Add a <<add-sample-data, sample data set>> and take {kib} for a test drive without loading data yourself.
* Follow one of our built-in tutorials to set up a data flow between your app and the Elastic Stack.
(If a tutorial doesn’t exist for your data, go to the
{beats-ref}/beats-reference.html[Beats overview] to learn about other data shippers
in the {beats} family.)

* Use the upload file feature and upload your own data.
* Use the {es} {ref}/docs-bulk.html[bulk] API to load your own data set.

Before you can start working with data, you must have an <<index-patterns, index pattern>>.  This pattern
tells {kib} which {es} indices you want to explore.
Index patterns are included in our sample data sets
and built-in tutorials. Or, you can create one at any time in **Management.**

[[explore-and-query]]
=== Explore & query

Ready to dive into your data? With <<discover, Discover>>, you can explore your data and
search for hidden insights and relationships. Ask your questions, and then
narrow the results to just the data you want.

[[visualize-and-analyze]]
=== Visualize & analyze

A visualization is worth a thousand log lines, and {kib} provides
many options for showcasing your data. Use <<visualize, Visualize>> to create
classic line charts, bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, and tables
(just to name a few).

Once your visualizations are just the way you want,
use <<dashboard, Dashboard>> to collect them in one place. A dashboard provides
insights into your data from multiple perspectives, and you can watch the data
change in real time.

{kib} also has these features that address specific visualization needs.

* <<lens, Lens>> provides a drag-and-drop experience that helps
you get insights from your data in just a few clicks. If there is a
better visualization for your data, Lens suggests it, allowing
for quick switching between visualization types.

* <<canvas, Canvas>> gives you the ability to present your data in a
visually compelling, pixel-perfect report. Give your data the “wow” factor
needed to impress your CEO or to captivate people with a big-screen display.

* <<maps, Elastic Maps>> enables you to ask (and answer) meaningful
questions of your location-based data. Elastic Maps supports multiple
layers and data sources, mapping of individual geo points and shapes,
and dynamic client-side styling.

* <<TSVB, TSVB>> allows you to combine
an infinite number of aggregations to display complex data in a meaningful way.
With TSVB, you can analyze multiple index patterns and customize
every aspect of your visualization. Choose your own date format and color
gradients, and easily switch your data view between time series, metric,
top N, gauge, and markdown.

[[organize-and-secure]]
=== Organize & secure

Want to share Kibana’s goodness with other people or teams? You can do so with
<<xpack-spaces, Spaces>>, built for organizing your visualizations, dashboards, and indices.
Think of a space as its own mini {kib} installation &mdash; it’s isolated from
all other spaces, so you can tailor it to your specific needs without impacting others.

You can even choose which features to enable within each space. Don’t need
Machine learning in your “Executive” space? Simply turn it off.

You can take this all one step further with Kibana’s security features, and
control which users have access to each space. {kib} allows for fine-grained
controls here, so you can give a user read-only access to
dashboards in one space, but full access to all of Kibana’s features in another.

[[manage-all-things-stack]]
=== Manage all things Elastic Stack

<<management, Management>> provides guided processes for managing all
things Elastic Stack &mdash; indices, clusters, licenses, UI settings, index patterns,
and more. Want to update your {es} indices? Set user roles and privileges?
Turn on dark mode? Kibana has UIs for all that.

[[extend-your-use-case]]
=== Extend your use case...or add a new one

As a hub for Elastic's https://www.elastic.co/products/[solutions], {kib}
can help you find security vulnerabilities,
monitor performance, and address your business needs. Get alerted if a key
metric spikes. Detect anomalous behavior or forecast future spikes. Root out
bottlenecks in your application code. Kibana doesn’t limit or dictate how you explore your data.

[[try-kibana]]
=== Give {kib} a try

There is no faster way to try out {kib} than with our hosted {es} Service.
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup[Sign up for a free trial]
and start exploring data in minutes.

You can also install {kib} on your own &mdash; no code, no additional
infrastructure required.

Our <<tutorial-build-dashboard, Getting Started>> and in-product guidance can
help you get up and running, faster. Our Help menu has options if you have questions or feedback.
