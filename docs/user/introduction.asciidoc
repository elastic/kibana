== {kib}&mdash;analyze and manage your data
++++
<titleabbrev>What is Kibana?</titleabbrev>
++++

{kib} is your window into the Elastic Stack.
{kib} enables you to:

* *Analyze and visualize your data.*
Search for hidden insights, compile a dashboard of charts, gauges,
maps and other visualizations that show what you found, and share it with others.

* *Search, observe, and protect your data.*
Add a search box to your app or website, analyze logs metrics, and
find security vulnerabilities.

* *Manage, monitor, and secure the Elastic Stack.*
Manage your indices and ingest pipelines, monitor the health of your
Elastic Stack cluster, and control which users have access to which features and data.

*{kib} is for admins, analysts, and business users alike.*
As an admin, you’re concerned with managing the system, from establishing
the deployment to getting {es} data into {kib}, and then
managing the data.  As an analyst, your job is to discover insights
in the data, visualize your data on dashboards, and share your findings.  As a business user,
you want to view existing dashboards and drill down into details.

*{kib} works with all types of data:* structured or unstructured text,
numerical data, time-series data, geospatial data, logs, metrics, security events,
and more.  Kibana is designed to use Elasticsearch as a data store.
No matter your data, {kib} can help you use it to tackle your problems.

[[kibana-home-page]]
=== Where to start

Even with so much to offer, {kib} makes it easy to find your path forward.
On the home page, you’re guided toward the most common use cases.
For a reference of all {kib} app use cases, refer to <<whats-the-right-app,What’s the right app for you?>>

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/home-page.png[Kibana home page]

The Kibana main menu can get you where you need to go, at any time. Like the home page,
the menu is organized by use case. Want to work with your logs, metrics, APM, or
Uptime data? The apps you need are under *Observability*. The main menu also includes
*Recently viewed* so you can easily access your previously opened apps.

Hidden by default, you can access the main menu with a single click on the
hamburger icon. Use the *Dock navigation* link at the bottom of the sidebar to keep the navigation visible.

[[kibana-navigation-search]]
=== Navigating {kib}

Another way to navigate {kib} is by using search in the global header.
You can jump between applications and the objects you’ve saved, including
dashboards, visualizations, workpads, and searches.

When searching for objects, you can search by type, by name, and by tag.
Tags are keywords or labels that you assign to {kib} saved objects,
so you can classify them in a way that is meaningful to you.
You can then quickly search for related objects based on shared tags.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/tags-search.png[Example of searching for tags]

Following are quick tips to get the most from the search feature.
Both capabilities are noted in the footer of the search popover, as a reminder.

* Use the keyboard shortcut&mdash;Ctrl+/ on Windows and Linux, Command+/ on MacOS&mdash;to focus on the input at any time.

* Filter search results via the provided syntax keywords:

[[visualize-and-analyze]]
=== Analyze your data

Data exploration and visualizations are core features of {kib}.
You can quickly search through large amounts of data, explore fields and values
present, and then use {kib}’s drag-and-drop interface to rapidly build charts, tables, metrics, and more.

==== Create visualizations

A typical data visualization journey looks like this, from adding your data to sharing your results.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualization-journey.png[User visualization journey]

[[get-data-into-kibana]]
. *Add data.* The best way to add {es} data to {kib} is to use one of our guided processes,
available from the <<kibana-home-page,home page>>. You can collect data from an app or service or upload a
file that contains your data. If you’re not ready to use your own data,
you can add a sample data set and give {kib} a test drive.

. *Explore.* With <<discover,*Discover*>>, you can search your data for hidden
insights and relationships. Ask your questions, and then filter the results to just the data you want.
Or, just see the most recent documents added to {es}.

. *Visualize.* {kib} provides many options for visualizing your data&mdash;from simple
aggregation-based charts to complex time series visualizations.
<<dashboard, *Dashboard*>> is your starting point for building visualizations,
and then pulling them together to show your data from multiple perspectives.

. *Present.*  Display your data on a visually
compelling, pixel-perfect <<canvas, *Canvas*>> workpad. With **Canvas**, you can give your data
the “wow” factor needed to impress your CEO, or  captivate coworkers with a big-screen display.

. *Share.* Share your findings using the option that works best for you&mdash;embed
a dashboard, share a link, or export to PDF, PNG, or CSV files and send as an attachment.

For hands-on experience with analyzing your data, check out the Elastic https://www.elastic.co/demos[demo site].

[float]
==== Plot location data on a map
If you’re looking to better understand the “where’’ in your data, your data
visualization journey will also include <<maps, *Maps*>>. This app is the right
choice when you’re looking for a spatial pattern, performing ad-hoc location-driven analysis,
or analyzing metrics with a geographic perspective. With *Maps*, you can build
world country maps, administrative region maps, and point-to-point origin-destination maps.
You can also visualize and track movement over space and through time.

[float]
==== Model data behavior

{kib}’s <<xpack-ml, *{ml-cap}*>> is for modeling the behavior of your data.
This app can help you extract insights from your data that you might otherwise miss.
You can forecast unusual behavior in your time series data.
You can also perform outlier detection, regression, and classification analysis
on your data and generate annotated results.

[float]
==== Graph relationships

The <<xpack-graph, *Graph*>> app enables you to uncover how items in your
data are related. This is useful in a variety of applications,
from fraud detection to recommendation engines. For example, graph exploration
can help you uncover website vulnerabilities that hackers are targeting
so you can harden your website. Or, you might provide graph-based
personalized recommendations to your e-commerce customers.

[[extend-your-use-case]]
=== Search, observe, and protect

Being able to search, observe, and protect your data is a requirement for any analyst.
{kib} provides apps for each of these use cases.

* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/index.html[*Enterprise Search*] enables you to create a search experience for your app, workplace, and website.

* {observability-guide}/observability-introduction.html[*Elastic Observability*] enables you to monitor and apply analytics in real time
to events happening across all your environments. You can analyze log events, monitor the performance metrics for the host or container
that it ran in, trace the transaction, and check the overall service availability.

* Designed for security analysts, {security-guide}/es-overview.html[*Elastic Security*] provides an overview of
the events and alerts from your environment.  This app helps you defend
your organization from threats before damage and loss occur.

[[manage-all-things-stack]]
=== Manage all things Elastic Stack

{kib}'s <<management, Stack Management>> takes administrators under the hood,
so they can twist the levers and turn the knobs.  *Stack Management* provides
guided processes for administering all things Elastic Stack,
including data, indices, clusters, alerts, and security.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/intro-management.png[]

[float]
==== Manage your data, indices, and clusters

{kib} offers these data management tasks from the convenience of a UI:

* Refresh, flush, and clear the cache of your indices.
* Define the lifecycle of an index as it ages.
* Define a policy for taking snapshots of your cluster.
* Roll up data from one or more indices into a new, compact index.
* Replicate indices on a remote cluster and copy them to a local cluster.

[float]
==== Alert and take action
Detecting and acting on significant shifts and signals in your data is a need
that exists in almost every use case. For example, you might set an alert to notify you when:

* A shift occurs in your business critical KPIs.
* System resources, such as memory, CPU and disk space, take a dip.
* An unusually high number of service requests, suspicious processes, and login attempts occurs.

Alerts are triggered when a specified condition is met. For example,
you might set an alert to trigger when the average or max of one of
your metrics exceeds a threshold within a specified time frame.

When the alert triggers, you can send a notification to a system that is part of
your daily workflow. {kib} integrates with email, Slack, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, Jira and IBM Resilient.

A dedicated view for creating, searching, and editing all your alerts is in <<alert-management,*Alerts and Actions*>>.

[float]
[[organize-and-secure]]
=== Organize your work in spaces

Want to share {kib}’s goodness with other people or teams without overwhelming them? You can do so
with <<xpack-spaces, Spaces>>, built for organizing your visualizations, dashboards, and indices.
, built for organizing your visualizations and dashboards.
Think of a space as its own mini {kib} installation&mdash;it’s isolated from all other spaces,
so you can tailor it to your specific needs without impacting others.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/select-your-space.png[Space selector screen]

Most of {kib}’s entities are space-aware, including dashboards, visualizations, index patterns,
Canvas workpads, Timelion visualizations, graphs, tags, and machine learning jobs.

In addition:

* **Elastic Security** is space-aware, so the timelines and investigations
you open in one space will not be available to other spaces.

* **Observability** is currently partially space-aware, but will be enhanced to become fully space-aware.

* Most of the **Stack Management** features are not space aware because they
are primarily used to manage features of {es}, which serves as a shared data store for all spaces.

* Alerts are space-aware and work nicely with the {kib} role-based access control
model to allow you secure access to them, depending on the alert type and your user roles.
For example, roles with no access to an app will not have access to its alerts.

[float]
==== Control feature visibility

You can take spaces one step further and control which features are visible
within each space. For example, you might hide **Dev Tools** in your "Executive"
space or show **Stack Monitoring** only in your "Admin" space.

Controlling feature visibility is not a security feature. To secure access
to specific features on a per-user basis, you must configure
<<xpack-security-authorization,{kib} Security>>.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/features-control.png[Features Controls screen]

[float]
[[intro-kibana-Security]]
=== {kib} security

{kib} offers a range of security features for you to control who has access to what.
The security features are automatically turned on when {es-ref}/get-started-enable-security.html[security is enabled in
{es}. For a description of all available configuration options,
see <<security-settings-kb,Security settings in {kib}>>.

[float]
==== Log in
Kibana supports several <<kibana-authentication,authentication providers>>,
allowing you to login using {es}’s built-in realms, or by your own single sign-on provider.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/login-screen.png[Login screen]

[float]
==== Secure access

{kib} provides roles and privileges for controlling which users can
view and manage {kib} features. Privileges grant permission to view an application
or perform a specific action and are assigned to roles. Roles allow you to describe
a “template” of capabilities that you can grant to many users,
without having to redefine what each user should be able to do.

When you create a role, you can scope the assigned {kib} privileges to specific spaces.
This makes it possible to grant users different access levels in different spaces,
or even give users their very own private space. For example, power users might
have privileges to create and edit visualizations and dashboards,
while analysts or executives might have *Dashboard* and *Canvas* with read-only privileges.

{kib}’s role management interface allows you to describe these various access
levels, or you can easily automate role creation via our <<role-management-api,API>>.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/roles-and-privileges.png[{kib privileges}]

[float]
==== Audit access

Once you have your users and roles configured, you might want to maintain a
record of who did what, when. The {kib} audit log will record this information for you,
which can then be correlated with {es} audit logs to gain more insights into your
users’ behavior. For more information, see <<xpack-security-audit-logging,{kib} audit logging>>.
