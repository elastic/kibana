Timelion is a time series data visualizer that enables you to combine totally
independent data sources within a single visualization. It's driven by a simple
expression language you use to retrieve time series data, perform calculations
to tease out the answers to complex questions, and visualize the results.

For example, Timelion enables you to easily get the answers to questions like:

* How many pages does each unique user view over time?
* What's the difference in traffic volume between this Friday and last Friday?
* What percent of Japan's population came to my site today?
* What's the 10-day moving average of the S&P 500?
* What's the cumulative sum of all search requests received in the last 2 years?

== Creating Time Series Visualizations
To start building time-series visualizations, click **Timelion** in the side
navigation and run through the tutorial. Documentation for the Timelion
expression language is built-in. Click **Docs** in the toolbar to view
the available functions and access the tutorial. As you start to enter
functions in the query bar, Timelion displays the available arguments:

To incorporate a Timelion visualization into a Kibana dashboard, save the
Timelion expression as a Kibana dashboard panel. You can then add it to
a dashboard like any other visualization.

TIP: You can also create time series visualizations right from the Visualize
app--just select the Timelion visualization type and enter a Timelion
expression in the expression field.
