To display the raw data behind the visualization, click the bar at the bottom of the container. Tabs with detailed 
information about the raw data replace the visualization:

.Table
A representation of the underlying data, presented as a paginated data grid. You can sort the items 
in the table by clicking on the table headers at the top of each column.

.Request
The raw request used to query the server, presented in JSON format.

.Response
The raw response from the server, presented in JSON format.

.Statistics
A summary of the statistics related to the request and the response, presented as a data grid. The data 
grid includes the query duration, the request duration, the total number of records found on the server, and the 
index pattern used to make the query.

To export the raw data behind the visualization as a comma-separated-values (CSV) file, click on either the
*Raw* or *Formatted* links at the bottom of any of the detailed information tabs. A raw export contains the data as it 
is stored in Elasticsearch. A formatted export contains the results of any applicable Kibana 
<<managing-fields,field formatters>>.
