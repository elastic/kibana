You do not need to configure any settings to use {kib} {ml-features}. They are
enabled by default.

  If set to `false` in `kibana.yml`, the {ml} icon is hidden in this {kib}
  instance. If `xpack.ml.enabled` is set to `true` in `elasticsearch.yml`, however,
  you can still use the {ml} APIs. To disable {ml} entirely, see the
  {ref}/ml-settings.html[{es} {ml} settings].
