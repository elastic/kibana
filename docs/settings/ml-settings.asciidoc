You do not need to configure any settings to use {ml}. It is enabled by default.

`xpack.ml.enabled`::
Set to `true` (default) to enable {ml}. +
+
If set to `false` in `kibana.yml`, the {ml} icon is hidden in this {kib}
instance. If `xpack.ml.enabled` is set to `true` in `elasticsearch.yml`, however,
you can still use the {ml} APIs. To disable {ml} entirely, see the
{ref}/ml-settings.html[{es} Machine Learning Settings].
