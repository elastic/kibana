You do not need to configure any settings to use {kib} {ml-features}. They are
enabled by default.

[[general-ml-settings-kb]]
==== General {ml} settings

`xpack.ml.enabled` {ess-icon}::
deprecated:[7.16.0,"In 8.0 and later, this setting will no longer be supported."]
Set to `true` (default) to enable {kib} {ml-features}. +
+
If set to `false` in `kibana.yml`, the {ml} icon is hidden in this {kib}
instance. If `xpack.ml.enabled` is set to `true` in `elasticsearch.yml`, however,
you can still use the {ml} APIs. To disable {ml} entirely, refer to
{ref}/ml-settings.html[{es} {ml} settings].
