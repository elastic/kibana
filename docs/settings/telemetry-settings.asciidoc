By default, Usage Collection (also known as Telemetry) is enabled. This
helps us learn about the {kib} features that our users are most interested in, so we
can focus our efforts on making them even better.

You can control whether this data is sent from the {kib} servers, or if it should be sent
from the user's browser, in case a firewall is blocking the connections from the server. Additionally, you can decide to completely disable this feature either in the config file or in {kib} via *Management > Kibana > Advanced Settings > Usage Data*.

See our https://www.elastic.co/legal/privacy-statement[Privacy Statement] to learn more.

==== General telemetry settings

`telemetry.sendUsageFrom`::
  Set to `'server'` to report the cluster statistics from the {kib} server.
  If the server fails to connect to our endpoint at https://telemetry.elastic.co/, it assumes
  it is behind a firewall and falls back to `'browser'` to send it from users' browsers
  when they are navigating through {kib}. Defaults to `'server'`.

[[telemetry-optIn]] `telemetry.optIn`::
  Set to `true` to send cluster statistics to Elastic. Reporting your
  cluster statistics helps us improve your user experience. Your data is never
  shared with anyone. Set to `false` to stop sending any telemetry data to Elastic. +
+
This setting can be changed at any time in <<advanced-options, Advanced Settings>>.
To prevent users from changing it,
set <<telemetry-allowChangingOptInStatus, `telemetry.allowChangingOptInStatus`>> to `false`. Defaults to `true`.

`telemetry.allowChangingOptInStatus`::
  Set to `true` to allow overwriting the <<telemetry-optIn, `telemetry.optIn`>> setting via the <<advanced-options, Advanced Settings>> in {kib}. Defaults to `true`.
