=== Monitoring Settings in Kibana
++++
<titleabbrev>Monitoring Settings</titleabbrev>
++++

By default, the Monitoring application is enabled, but data collection
is disabled.  When you first start {kib} monitoring, you are prompted to
enable data collection. If you are using {security}, you must be 
signed in as a user with the `cluster:manage` privilege to enable
data collection. The built-in `superuser` role has this privilege and the
built-in `elastic` user has this role. 

You can adjust how monitoring data is
collected from {kib} and displayed in {kib} by configuring settings in the
`kibana.yml` file. There are also `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.*` settings,
which support the same values as <<settings,{kib} configuration settings>>.

To control how data is collected from your {es} nodes, you configure
{ref}/monitoring-settings.html[`xpack.monitoring.collection`
settings] in `elasticsearch.yml`. To control how monitoring data is collected
from Logstash, you configure
{logstash-ref}/configuring-logstash.html#monitoring-settings[`xpack.monitoring` settings]
in `logstash.yml`.

For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the Elastic Stack].

[[monitoring-general-settings]]
==== General Monitoring Settings

`xpack.monitoring.enabled`::
Set to `true` (default) to enable {monitoring} in {kib}. Unlike the
`xpack.monitoring.ui.enabled` setting, when this setting is `false`, the
monitoring back-end does not run and {kib} stats are not sent to the monitoring
cluster.

`xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url`::
Specifies the location of the {es} cluster where your monitoring data is stored.
By default, this is the same as the `elasticsearch.url`. This setting enables
you to use a single {kib} instance to search and visualize data in your
production cluster as well as monitor data sent to a dedicated monitoring
cluster.

`xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.username`::
Specifies the user ID that {kib} uses for authentication when it retrieves data
from the monitoring cluster. If not set, {kib} uses the value of the
`elasticsearch.username` setting.

`xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password`::
Specifies the password that {kib} uses for authentication when it retrieves data
from the monitoring cluster. If not set, {kib} uses the value of the
`elasticsearch.password` setting.

`xpack.monitoring.report_stats`::
deprecated[6.3.0, Use `xpack.xpack_main.telemetry.enabled` instead.]

`xpack.xpack_main.telemetry.enabled`::
Set to `true` (default) to send cluster statistics to Elastic. Reporting your
cluster statistics helps us improve your user experience. Your data is never
shared with anyone. Set to `false` to disable statistics reporting from any
browser connected to the {kib} instance. You can also opt out through the
*Advanced Settings* in {kib}.

`xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.pingTimeout`::
Specifies the time in milliseconds to wait for {es} to respond to internal
health checks. By default, it matches the `elasticsearch.pingTimeout` setting,
which has a default value of `30000`.

[float]
[[monitoring-collection-settings]]
==== Monitoring Collection Settings

These settings control how data is collected from {kib}.

`xpack.monitoring.kibana.collection.enabled`::
Set to `true` (default) to enable data collection from the {kib} NodeJS server
for {kib} Dashboards to be featured in the Monitoring.

`xpack.monitoring.kibana.collection.interval`::
Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait in between data sampling on the
{kib} NodeJS server for the metrics that are displayed in the {kib} dashboards.
Defaults to `10000` (10 seconds).


[float]
[[monitoring-ui-settings]]
==== Monitoring UI Settings

These settings adjust how the {kib} Monitoring page displays monitoring data.
However, the defaults work best in most circumstances. For more information
about configuring {kib}, see
{kibana-ref}/settings.html[Setting Kibana Server Properties].

`xpack.monitoring.ui.enabled`::
Set to `false` to hide the Monitoring UI in {kib}. The monitoring back-end
continues to run as an agent for sending {kib} stats to the monitoring
cluster. Defaults to `true`.

`xpack.monitoring.max_bucket_size`::
Specifies the number of term buckets to return out of the overall terms list when
performing terms aggregations to retrieve index and node metrics. For more
information about the `size` parameter, see
{ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation-size[Terms Aggregation].
Defaults to `10000`.

`xpack.monitoring.min_interval_seconds`::
Specifies the minimum number of seconds that a time bucket in a chart can
represent. Defaults to 10. If you modify the
`xpack.monitoring.collection.interval` in `elasticsearch.yml`, use the same
value in this setting.

[float]
[[monitoring-ui-cgroup-settings]]
===== Monitoring UI Container Settings

The Monitoring UI exposes the Cgroup statistics that we collect for you to make
better decisions about your container performance, rather than guessing based on
the overall machine performance. If you are not running your applications in a
container, then Cgroup statistics are not useful.

`xpack.monitoring.ui.container.elasticsearch.enabled`::

For {es} clusters that are running in containers, this setting changes the
*Node Listing* to display the CPU utilization based on the reported Cgroup
statistics. It also adds the calculated Cgroup CPU utilization to the
*Node Overview* page instead of the overall operating system's CPU
utilization. Defaults to `false`.
