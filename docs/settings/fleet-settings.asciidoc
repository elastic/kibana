[NOTE]
====
In {ecloud}, {fleet} flags are already configured.

You can configure `xpack.fleet` settings in your `kibana.yml`. 
By default, {fleet} is enabled. To use {fleet}, you also need to configure {kib} and {es} hosts.

See the {fleet-guide}/index.html[{fleet}] docs for more information.

==== Preconfiguration settings (for advanced use cases)

Use these settings to pre-define integrations and agent policies that you
want {fleet} to load up by default.

[cols="2*<a"]
|===

| `xpack.fleet.packages`
  | List of integrations that are installed when the {fleet} app starts
  up for the first time. Required properties are:
  
  `name`:: Name of the integration from the package registry.
  `version`:: Either an exact semantic version, or the keyword `latest` to fetch
  the latest integration version.

| `xpack.fleet.agentPolicies`
  | List of agent policies that are configured when the {fleet} app starts.
Required properties are:

  `id`:: Unique ID for this policy. The ID may be a number or string.
  `name`:: Policy name.

Optional properties are:
  
  `description`:: Text description of this policy.
  `namespace`:: String identifying this policy's namespace.
  `monitoring_enabled`:: List of keywords that specify the monitoring data to collect.
  Valid values include `['logs']`, `['metrics']`, and `['logs', 'metrics']`.
  `is_managed`:: If `true`, this policy is editable by the user and can only
  be changed by updating the {kib} config.
  `is_default`:: If `true`, this policy is the default agent policy.
  `is_default_fleet_server`:: If `true`, this policy is the default {fleet-server} agent policy.
  `data_output_id`:: ID of the output to send data (Need to be identical to `monitoring_output_id`)
  `monitoring_output_id`:: ID of the output to send monitoring data. (Need to be identical to `data_output_id`)
  `package_policies`:: List of integration policies to add to this policy.
    `name`::: (required) Name of the integration policy.
    `package`::: (required) Integration that this policy configures
      `name`:::: Name of the integration associated with this policy.
    `description`::: Text string describing this integration policy.
    `namespace`::: String identifying this policy's namespace.
    `inputs`::: Array that overrides any default input settings for this
    integration. Follows the same schema as integration inputs, with the
    exception that any object in `vars` can be passed `frozen: true` in order to
    prevent that specific `var` from being edited by the user.

| `xpack.fleet.outputs`
  | List of outputs that are configured when the {fleet} app starts.
Required properties are:

  `id`:: Unique ID for this output. The ID should be a string.
  `name`:: Output name.
  `type`:: Type of Output. Currently we only support "elasticsearch".
  `hosts`:: Array that contains the list of host for that output.
  `config`:: Extra config for that output.

Optional properties are:

  `is_default`:: If `true`, this output is the default output.
