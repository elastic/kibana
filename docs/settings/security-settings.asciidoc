You do not need to configure any additional settings to use the
{security-features} in {kib}. They are enabled by default.

| `xpack.security.enabled`
  | By default, {kib} automatically detects whether to enable the
  {security-features} based on the license and whether {es} {security-features}
  are enabled. +
  +
  Do not set this to `false`; it disables the login form, user and role management
  screens, and authorization using <<kibana-privileges>>. To disable
  {security-features} entirely, see
  {ref}/security-settings.html[{es} security settings].

| `xpack.security.audit.enabled`
  | Set to `true` to enable audit logging for security events. By default, it is set
  to `false`. For more details see <<xpack-security-audit-logging>>.

==== User interface security settings

You can configure the following settings in the `kibana.yml` file.

[cols="2*<"]
|===
| `xpack.security.cookieName`
  | Sets the name of the cookie used for the session. The default value is `"sid"`.

| `xpack.security.encryptionKey`
  | An arbitrary string of 32 characters or more that is used to encrypt credentials
  in a cookie. It is crucial that this key is not exposed to users of {kib}. By
  default, a value is automatically generated in memory. If you use that default
  behavior, all sessions are invalidated when {kib} restarts.
  In addition, high-availability deployments of {kib} will behave unexpectedly
  if this setting isn't the same for all instances of {kib}.

| `xpack.security.secureCookies`
  | Sets the `secure` flag of the session cookie. The default value is `false`. It
  is automatically set to `true` if `server.ssl.enabled` is set to `true`. Set
  this to `true` if SSL is configured outside of {kib} (for example, you are
  routing requests through a load balancer or proxy).

| `xpack.security.sameSiteCookies`
  | Sets the `SameSite` attribute of the session cookie. This allows you to declare whether your cookie should be restricted to a first-party or same-site context.
  Valid values are `Strict`, `Lax`, `None`.
  This is *not set* by default, which modern browsers will treat as `Lax`. If you use Kibana embedded in an iframe in modern browsers, you might need to set it to `None`. Setting this value to `None` requires cookies to be sent over a secure connection by setting `xpack.security.secureCookies: true`.

| `xpack.security.session.idleTimeout`
  | Sets the session duration. By default, sessions stay active until the
  browser is closed. When this is set to an explicit idle timeout, closing the
  browser still requires the user to log back in to {kib}.

============
The format is a string of `<count>[ms|s|m|h|d|w|M|Y]`
(e.g. '70ms', '5s', '3d', '1Y').

| `xpack.security.session.lifespan`
  | Sets the maximum duration, also known as "absolute timeout". By default,
  a session can be renewed indefinitely. When this value is set, a session will end
  once its lifespan is exceeded, even if the user is not idle. NOTE: if `idleTimeout`
  is not set, this setting will still cause sessions to expire.
