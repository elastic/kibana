You do not need to configure any additional settings to use {security} in {kib}.
It is enabled by default.

==== General Security Settings
`xpack.security.enabled`::
Set to `true` (default) to enable {security}. +
+
If set to `false` in `kibana.yml`, the user and role management options are
hidden in this {kib} instance. If `xpack.security.enabled` is set to `true` in
`elasticsearch.yml`, however, you can still use the {security} APIs. To disable
{security} entirely, see the
{ref}/security-settings.html[{es} Security Settings].

==== User Interface Security Settings

You can configure the following settings in the `kibana.yml` file:

`xpack.security.cookieName`::
Sets the name of the cookie used for the session. The default value is `"sid"`

`xpack.security.encryptionKey`::
An arbitrary string of 32 characters or more that is used to encrypt credentials
in a cookie. It is crucial that this key is not exposed to users of {kib}. By
default, a value is automatically generated in memory. If you use that default
behavior, all sessions are invalidated when {kib} restarts.

`xpack.security.secureCookies`::
Sets the `secure` flag of the session cookie. The default value is `false`. It
is set to `true` if `server.ssl.certificate` and `server.ssl.key` are set. Set
this to `true` if SSL is configured outside of {kib} (for example, you are
routing requests through a load balancer or proxy).

`xpack.security.sessionTimeout`::
Sets the session duration (in milliseconds). By default, sessions stay active
until the browser is closed.
