You do not need to configure any additional settings to use the
{security-features} in {kib}. They are enabled by default.

==== General security settings

`xpack.security.enabled`::
By default, {kib} automatically detects whether to enable the
{security-features} based on the license and whether {es} {security-features}
are enabled.
+
Do not set this to `false`; it disables the login form, user and role management
screens, and authorization using <<kibana-privileges>>. To disable
{security-features} entirely, see
{ref}/security-settings.html[{es} security settings].

`xpack.security.audit.enabled`::
Set to `true` to enable audit logging for security events. By default, it is set
to `false`. For more details see <<xpack-security-audit-logging>>.

==== User interface security settings

You can configure the following settings in the `kibana.yml` file:

`xpack.security.cookieName`::
Sets the name of the cookie used for the session. The default value is `"sid"`.

`xpack.security.encryptionKey`::
An arbitrary string of 32 characters or more that is used to encrypt credentials
in a cookie. It is crucial that this key is not exposed to users of {kib}. By
default, a value is automatically generated in memory. If you use that default
behavior, all sessions are invalidated when {kib} restarts.
In addition, high-availability deployments of {kib} will behave unexpectedly
if this setting isn't the same for all instances of {kib}.

`xpack.security.secureCookies`::
Sets the `secure` flag of the session cookie. The default value is `false`. It
is set to `true` if `server.ssl.certificate` and `server.ssl.key` are set. Set
this to `true` if SSL is configured outside of {kib} (for example, you are
routing requests through a load balancer or proxy).

`xpack.security.session.idleTimeout`::
Sets the session duration. The format is a string of `<count>[ms|s|m|h|d|w|M|Y]`
(e.g. '70ms', '5s', '3d', '1Y'). By default, sessions stay active until the
browser is closed. When this is set to an explicit idle timeout, closing the
browser still requires the user to log back in to {kib}.

`xpack.security.session.lifespan`::
Sets the maximum duration, also known as "absolute timeout". The format is a
string of `<count>[ms|s|m|h|d|w|M|Y]` (e.g. '70ms', '5s', '3d', '1Y'). By default,
a session can be renewed indefinitely. When this value is set, a session will end
once its lifespan is exceeded, even if the user is not idle. NOTE: if `idleTimeout`
is not set, this setting will still cause sessions to expire.

`xpack.security.loginAssistanceMessage`::
Adds a message to the login screen. Useful for displaying information about maintenance windows, links to corporate sign up pages etc.
