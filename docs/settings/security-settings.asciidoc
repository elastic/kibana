It is enabled by default.

==== General Security Settings
`xpack.security.enabled`::
Set to `true` (default) to enable {security}. +
+
Do not set this to `false`. To disable {security} entirely, see
{ref}/security-settings.html[{es} Security Settings]. +
+
If set to `false` in `kibana.yml`, the login form, user and role management screens, and 
authorization using <<kibana-privileges>> are disabled. +
+
`xpack.security.audit.enabled`::
Set to `true` to enable audit logging for security events. This is set to `false` by default.
For more details see <<xpack-security-audit-logging>>.

`xpack.security.authorization.legacyFallback`::
Set to `true` (default) to enable the legacy fallback. See <<xpack-security-authorization>>
for more details.

==== User Interface Security Settings

You can configure the following settings in the `kibana.yml` file:

`xpack.security.cookieName`::
Sets the name of the cookie used for the session. The default value is `"sid"`.

`xpack.security.encryptionKey`::
An arbitrary string of 32 characters or more that is used to encrypt credentials
in a cookie. It is crucial that this key is not exposed to users of {kib}. By
default, a value is automatically generated in memory. If you use that default
behavior, all sessions are invalidated when {kib} restarts.

`xpack.security.secureCookies`::
Sets the `secure` flag of the session cookie. The default value is `false`. It
is set to `true` if `server.ssl.certificate` and `server.ssl.key` are set. Set
this to `true` if SSL is configured outside of {kib} (for example, you are
routing requests through a load balancer or proxy).

`xpack.security.sessionTimeout`::
Sets the session duration (in milliseconds). By default, sessions stay active
until the browser is closed.
