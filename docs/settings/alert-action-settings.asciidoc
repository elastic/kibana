=== Alerting and action settings in Kibana
++++
<titleabbrev>Alerting and action settings</titleabbrev>
++++

Alerts and actions are enabled by default in {kib}, but require you configure the following in order to use them:

. <<using-kibana-with-security,Set up {kib} to work with {stack} {security-features}>>.
. <<configuring-tls-kib-es,Set up TLS encryption between {kib} and {es}>>.
. <<general-alert-action-settings,Specify a value for `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`>>.

You can configure the following settings in the `kibana.yml` file.

| `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`
  | A string of 32 or more characters used to encrypt sensitive properties on alerts and actions before they're stored in {es}. Third party credentials &mdash; such as the username and password used to connect to an SMTP service &mdash; are an example of encrypted properties. +
  +
  If not set, {kib} will generate a random key on startup, but all alert and action functions will be blocked. Generated keys are not allowed for alerts and actions because when a new key is generated on restart, existing encrypted data becomes inaccessible. For the same reason, alerts and actions in high-availability deployments of {kib} will behave unexpectedly if the key isn't the same on all instances of {kib}. +
  +
  Although the key can be specified in clear text in `kibana.yml`, it's recommended to store this key securely in the <<secure-settings,{kib} Keystore>>.

| `xpack.actions.whitelistedHosts`
  | A list of hostnames that {kib} is allowed to connect to when built-in actions are triggered. It defaults to `[*]`, allowing any host, but keep in mind the potential for SSRF attacks when hosts are not explicitly whitelisted. An empty list `[]` can be used to block built-in actions from making any external connections. +
  +
  Note that hosts associated with built-in actions, such as Slack and PagerDuty, are not automatically whitelisted. If you are not using the default `[*]` setting, you must ensure that the corresponding endpoints are whitelisted as well.

| `xpack.actions.enabledActionTypes`
  | A list of action types that are enabled. It defaults to `[*]`, enabling all types. The names for built-in {kib} action types are prefixed with a `.` and include: `.server-log`, `.slack`, `.email`, `.index`, `.pagerduty`, and `.webhook`. An empty list `[]` will disable all action types. +
  +
  Disabled action types will not appear as an option when creating new connectors, but existing connectors and actions of that type will remain in {kib} and will not function.
