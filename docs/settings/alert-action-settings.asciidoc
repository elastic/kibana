:frontmatter-tags-products: [kibana, alerting] 
:frontmatter-tags-content-type: [reference] 
:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [configure]

Alerting and actions are enabled by default in {kib}, but require you to configure the following:

. <<using-kibana-with-security,Set up {kib} to work with {stack} {security-features}>>.
. <<configuring-tls-kib-es,Set up TLS encryption between {kib} and {es}>>.
. If you are using an *on-premises* Elastic Stack deployment, <<general-alert-action-settings,specify a value for `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`>>.

You can configure the following settings in the `kibana.yml` file.

[float]
[[general-alert-action-settings]]
=== General settings

`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`::
A string of 32 or more characters used to encrypt sensitive properties on alerting rules and actions before they're stored in {es}. Third party credentials &mdash; such as the username and password used to connect to an SMTP service &mdash; are an example of encrypted properties.
+
{kib} offers a <<kibana-encryption-keys, CLI tool>> to help generate this encryption key.
+
If not set, {kib} will generate a random key on startup, but all alerting and action functions will be blocked. Generated keys are not allowed for alerting and actions because when a new key is generated on restart, existing encrypted data becomes inaccessible. For the same reason, alerting and actions in high-availability deployments of {kib} will behave unexpectedly if the key isn't the same on all instances of {kib}.
+
Although the key can be specified in clear text in `kibana.yml`, it's recommended to store this key securely in the <<secure-settings,{kib} Keystore>>.
Be sure to back up the encryption key value somewhere safe, as your alerting rules and actions will cease to function due to decryption failures should you lose it.  If you want to rotate the encryption key, be sure to follow the instructions on <<encryption-key-rotation, encryption key rotation>>.

[float]
[[action-settings]]
=== Action settings

`xpack.actions.allowedHosts` {ess-icon}::
A list of hostnames that {kib} is allowed to connect to when built-in actions are triggered. It defaults to `["*"]`, allowing any host, but keep in mind the potential for SSRF attacks when hosts are not explicitly added to the allowed hosts. An empty list `[]` can be used to block built-in actions from making any external connections.
+
Note that hosts associated with built-in actions, such as Slack and PagerDuty, are not automatically added to allowed hosts. If you are not using the default `["*"]` setting, you must ensure that the corresponding endpoints are added to the allowed hosts as well.

`xpack.actions.customHostSettings` {ess-icon}::
A list of custom host settings to override existing global settings.
Default: an empty list.
+
Each entry in the list must have a `url` property, to associate a connection
type (mail or https), hostname and port with the remaining options in the
entry.
+
In the following example, two custom host settings
are defined.  The first provides a custom host setting for mail server
`mail.example.com` using port 465 that supplies server certificate authentication
data from both a file and inline, and requires TLS for the
connection.  The second provides a custom host setting for https server
`webhook.example.com` which turns off server certificate authentication,
that will allow Kibana to connect to the server if it's using a self-signed
certificate.  The individual properties that can be used in the settings are
documented below.
+
[source,yaml]
--
xpack.actions.customHostSettings:
  - url: smtp://mail.example.com:465
    ssl:
      verificationMode: 'full'
      certificateAuthoritiesFiles: [ 'one.crt' ]
      certificateAuthoritiesData: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          ... multiple lines of certificate data here ...
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    smtp:
      requireTLS: true
  - url: https://webhook.example.com
    ssl:
      verificationMode: 'none'
--
+
The settings in `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` can be used to override the
global option `xpack.actions.ssl.verificationMode` and provide customized TLS
settings on a per-server basis. Set `xpack.actions.ssl.verificationMode` to the
value to be used by default for all servers, then add an entry in
`xpack.actions.customHostSettings` for every server that requires customized
settings.

`xpack.actions.customHostSettings[n].url` {ess-icon}::
A URL associated with this custom host setting.  Should be in the form of
`protocol://hostname:port`, where `protocol` is `https` or `smtp`.  If the
port is not provided, 443 is used for `https` and 25 is used for
`smtp`.  The `smtp` URLs are used for the Email actions that use this
server, and the `https` URLs are used for actions which use `https` to
connect to services.
+
Entries with `https` URLs can use the `ssl` options, and entries with `smtp`
URLs can use both the `ssl` and `smtp` options.
+
No other URL values should be part of this URL, including paths,
query strings, and authentication information.  When an http or smtp request
is made as part of running an action, only the protocol, hostname, and
port of the URL for that request are used to look up these configuration
values.

`xpack.actions.customHostSettings[n].smtp.ignoreTLS` {ess-icon}::
A boolean value indicating that TLS must not be used for this connection.
The options `smtp.ignoreTLS` and `smtp.requireTLS` can not both be set to true.
Default: `false`.

`xpack.actions.customHostSettings[n].smtp.requireTLS` {ess-icon}::
A boolean value indicating that TLS must be used for this connection.
The options `smtp.ignoreTLS` and `smtp.requireTLS` can not both be set to true.
Default: `false`.

`xpack.actions.customHostSettings[n].ssl.rejectUnauthorized`::
deprecated:[8.0.0] Use <<action-config-custom-host-verification-mode,`xpack.actions.customHostSettings.ssl.verificationMode`>> instead. A boolean value indicating whether to bypass server certificate validation.
Overrides the general `xpack.actions.rejectUnauthorized` configuration
for requests made for this hostname/port.

[[action-config-custom-host-verification-mode]] `xpack.actions.customHostSettings[n].ssl.verificationMode` {ess-icon}::
Controls the verification of the server certificate that {kib} receives when making an outbound SSL/TLS connection to the host server. Valid values are `full`, `certificate`, and `none`.
Use `full` to perform hostname verification, `certificate` to skip hostname verification, and `none` to skip verification. Default: `full`. <<elasticsearch-ssl-verificationMode,Equivalent {kib} setting>>. Overrides the general `xpack.actions.ssl.verificationMode` configuration
for requests made for this hostname/port.

`xpack.actions.customHostSettings[n].ssl.certificateAuthoritiesFiles`::
A file name or list of file names of PEM-encoded certificate files to use
to validate the server.

`xpack.actions.customHostSettings[n].ssl.certificateAuthoritiesData` {ess-icon}::
The contents of a PEM-encoded certificate file, or multiple files appended
into a single string.  This configuration can be used for environments where
the files cannot be made available.

[[action-config-email-domain-allowlist]] `xpack.actions.email.domain_allowlist`  {ess-icon}::
A list of allowed email domains which can be used with the email connector. When this setting is not used, all email domains are allowed. When this setting is used, if any email is attempted to be sent that (a) includes an addressee with an email domain that is not in the allowlist, or (b) includes a from address domain that is not in the allowlist, it will fail with a message indicating the email is not allowed.
+
WARNING: This feature is available in {kib} 7.17.4 and 8.3.0 onwards but is not supported in {kib} 8.0, 8.1 or 8.2. As such, this setting should be removed before upgrading from 7.17 to 8.0, 8.1 or 8.2. It is possible to configure the settings in 7.17.4 and then upgrade to 8.3.0 directly.

`xpack.actions.enableFooterInEmail` {ess-icon}::
A boolean value indicating that a footer with a relevant link should be added to emails sent as alerting actions. Default: true.

`xpack.actions.enabledActionTypes` {ess-icon}::
A list of action types that are enabled. It defaults to `["*"]`, enabling all types. The names for built-in {kib} action types are prefixed with a `.` and include: `.email`, `.index`, `.jira`, `.opsgenie`, `.pagerduty`, `.resilient`, `.server-log`, `.servicenow`, .`servicenow-itom`, `.servicenow-sir`, `.slack`, `.swimlane`, `.teams`, `.tines`, `.torq`, `.xmatters`,  `.gen-ai`,  `.bedrock`, `.gemini`,  `.d3security`, and `.webhook`. An empty list `[]` will disable all action types.
+
Disabled action types will not appear as an option when creating new connectors, but existing connectors and actions of that type will remain in {kib} and will not function.

`xpack.actions.microsoftExchangeUrl`::
The URL for the Microsoft Azure Active Directory endpoint to use for MS Exchange email authentication. Default: `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.

`xpack.actions.microsoftGraphApiUrl`::
The URL for the Microsoft Graph API endpoint to use for MS Exchange email authentication. Default: `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`.

`xpack.actions.microsoftGraphApiScope`::
The URL for the Microsoft Graph API scope endpoint to use for MS Exchange email authentication. Default: `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default`.

`xpack.actions.proxyUrl` {ess-icon}::
Specifies the proxy URL to use, if using a proxy for actions. By default, no proxy is used.
+
Proxies may be used to proxy http or https requests through a proxy using the http or https protocol.  Kibana only uses proxies in "CONNECT" mode (sometimes referred to as "tunneling" TCP mode, compared to HTTP mode).  That is, Kibana will always make requests through a proxy using the HTTP `CONNECT` method.
+
If your proxy is using the https protocol (vs the http protocol), the setting `xpack.actions.ssl.proxyVerificationMode: none` will likely be needed, unless your proxy's certificates are signed using a publicly available certificate authority.
+
There is currently no support for using basic authentication with a proxy (authentication for the proxy itself, not the URL being requested through the proxy).
+
To help diagnose problems using a proxy, you can use the `curl` command with options to use your proxy, and log debug information, with the following command, replacing the proxy and target URLs as appropriate.  This will force the request to be made to the
proxy in tunneling mode, and display some of the interaction between the client and the proxy.
+
[source,sh]
--
curl --verbose --proxytunnel --proxy http://localhost:8080 http://example.com
--

`xpack.actions.proxyBypassHosts` {ess-icon}::
Specifies hostnames which should not use the proxy, if using a proxy for actions. The value is an array of hostnames as strings. Example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# If applicable, include the subdomain in the hostname
xpack.actions.proxyBypassHosts: [ "events.pagerduty.com" ]
----
+
By default, all hosts will use the proxy, but if an action's hostname is in this list, the proxy will not be used.  The settings `xpack.actions.proxyBypassHosts` and `xpack.actions.proxyOnlyHosts` cannot be used at the same time.

`xpack.actions.proxyOnlyHosts` {ess-icon}::
Specifies hostnames which should only use the proxy, if using a proxy for actions. The value is an array of hostnames as strings. Example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# If applicable, include the subdomain in the hostname
xpack.actions.proxyOnlyHosts: [ "events.pagerduty.com" ]
----
+
By default, no hosts will use the proxy, but if an action's hostname is in this list, the proxy will be used.  The settings `xpack.actions.proxyBypassHosts` and `xpack.actions.proxyOnlyHosts` cannot be used at the same time.

`xpack.actions.proxyHeaders` {ess-icon}::
Specifies HTTP headers for the proxy, if using a proxy for actions. Default: {}.

`xpack.actions.proxyRejectUnauthorizedCertificates` {ess-icon}::
deprecated:[8.0.0] Use <<action-config-proxy-verification-mode,`xpack.actions.ssl.proxyVerificationMode`>> instead. Set to `false` to bypass certificate validation for the proxy, if using a proxy for actions. Default: `true`.

[[action-config-proxy-verification-mode]]`xpack.actions.ssl.proxyVerificationMode` {ess-icon}::
Controls the verification for the proxy server certificate that Kibana receives when making an outbound SSL/TLS connection to the proxy server. Valid values are `full`, `certificate`, and `none`.
Use `full` to perform hostname verification, `certificate` to skip hostname verification, and `none` to skip verification. Default: `full`. <<elasticsearch-ssl-verificationMode,Equivalent {kib} setting>>.

`xpack.actions.rejectUnauthorized` {ess-icon}::
deprecated:[8.0.0] Use <<action-config-verification-mode,`xpack.actions.ssl.verificationMode`>> instead. Set to `false` to bypass certificate validation for actions. Default: `true`.
+
As an alternative to setting `xpack.actions.rejectUnauthorized`, you can use the setting
`xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set SSL options for specific servers.

[[action-config-verification-mode]] `xpack.actions.ssl.verificationMode` {ess-icon}::
Controls the verification for the server certificate that {hosted-ems} receives when making an outbound SSL/TLS connection for actions. Valid values are `full`, `certificate`, and `none`.
Use `full` to perform hostname verification, `certificate` to skip hostname verification, and `none` to skip verification. Default: `full`. <<elasticsearch-ssl-verificationMode,Equivalent {kib} setting>>.
+
This setting can be overridden for specific URLs by using the setting
`xpack.actions.customHostSettings[n].ssl.verificationMode` (described above) to a different value.

`xpack.actions.maxResponseContentLength` {ess-icon}::
Specifies the max number of bytes of the http response for requests to external resources. Default: 1000000 (1MB).

`xpack.actions.responseTimeout` {ess-icon}::
Specifies the time allowed for requests to external resources. Requests that take longer are canceled.
The time is formatted as a number and a time unit (`ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, `M`, or `Y`).
For example, `20m`, `24h`, `7d`, `1w`. Default: `60s`.

`xpack.actions.run.maxAttempts` {ess-icon}::
Specifies the maximum number of times an action can be attempted to run. Can be minimum 1 and maximum 10.

`xpack.actions.run.connectorTypeOverrides` {ess-icon}::
Overrides the configs under `xpack.actions.run` for the connector type with the given ID. List the connector type identifier and its settings in an array of objects. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
--
xpack.actions.run:
    maxAttempts: 1
    connectorTypeOverrides:
        - id: '.server-log'
          maxAttempts: 5
--

`xpack.actions.queued.max` {ess-icon}::
Specifies the maximum number of actions that can be queued. Default: 1000000

[[alert-settings]]
=== Alerting settings

`xpack.alerting.maxEphemeralActionsPerAlert` {ess-icon}::
deprecated:[8.8.0]
Sets the number of actions that will run ephemerally. To use this, enable
ephemeral tasks in task manager first with
<<task-manager-settings,`xpack.task_manager.ephemeral_tasks.enabled`>>

`xpack.alerting.cancelAlertsOnRuleTimeout` {ess-icon}::
Specifies whether to skip writing alerts and scheduling actions if rule
processing was cancelled due to a timeout. Default: `true`. This setting can be
overridden by individual rule types.

`xpack.alerting.rules.maxScheduledPerMinute`::
Specifies the maximum number of rules to run per minute. Default: 10000

`xpack.alerting.rules.minimumScheduleInterval.value` {ess-icon}::
Specifies the minimum schedule interval for rules. This minimum is applied to all rules created or updated after you set this value.
The time is formatted as a number and a time unit (`s`, `m`, `h`, or `d`). 
For example, `20m`, `24h`, `7d`. This duration cannot exceed `1d`. Default: `1m`.

`xpack.alerting.rules.minimumScheduleInterval.enforce` {ess-icon}::
Specifies the behavior when a new or changed rule has a schedule interval less than the value defined in `xpack.alerting.rules.minimumScheduleInterval.value`. If `false`, rules with schedules less than the interval will be created but warnings will be logged. If `true`, rules with schedules less than the interval cannot be created. Default: `false`.

`xpack.alerting.rules.run.actions.max` {ess-icon}::
Specifies the maximum number of actions that a rule can generate each time detection checks run.

`xpack.alerting.rules.run.alerts.max` {ess-icon}::
Specifies the maximum number of alerts that a rule can generate each time detection checks run. Default: 1000.
+
WARNING: The exact number of alerts your cluster can safely handle depends on your cluster configuration and workload, however setting a value higher than the default (`1000`) is not recommended or supported. Doing so could strain system resources and lead to performance issues, delays in alert processing, and potential disruptions during high alert activity periods.

`xpack.alerting.rules.run.timeout` {ess-icon}::
Specifies the default timeout for tasks associated with all types of rules.
The time is formatted as a number and a time unit (`ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, `M`, or `Y`).
For example, `20m`, `24h`, `7d`, `1w`. Default: `5m`.

`xpack.alerting.rules.run.ruleTypeOverrides` {ess-icon}::
Overrides the configs under `xpack.alerting.rules.run` for the rule type with the given ID. List the rule identifier and its settings in an array of objects. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
--
xpack.alerting.rules.run:
    timeout: '5m'
    ruleTypeOverrides:
        - id: '.index-threshold'
          timeout: '15m'
--

`xpack.alerting.rules.run.actions.connectorTypeOverrides` {ess-icon}::
Overrides the configs under `xpack.alerting.rules.run.actions` for the connector type with the given ID. List the connector type identifier and its settings in an array of objects. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
--
xpack.alerting.rules.run:
    actions:
        max: 10
        connectorTypeOverrides:
            - id: '.server-log'
              max: 5
