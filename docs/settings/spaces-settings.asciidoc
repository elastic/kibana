By default, spaces is enabled in {kib}. To secure spaces, <<security-settings-kb,enable security>>.

`xpack.spaces.enabled`::
deprecated:[7.16.0,"In 8.0 and later, this setting will no longer be supported and it will not be possible to disable this plugin."]
To enable spaces, set to `true`. 
The default is `true`.

`xpack.spaces.maxSpaces`::
The maximum number of spaces that you can use with the {kib} instance. Some {kib} operations
return all spaces using a single `_search` from {es}, so you must
configure this setting lower than the `index.max_result_window` in {es}.
The default is `1000`.
