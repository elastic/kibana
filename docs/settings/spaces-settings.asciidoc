By default, spaces is enabled in {kib}. To secure spaces, <<security-settings-kb,enable security>>.

`xpack.spaces.maxSpaces`::
The maximum number of spaces that you can use with the {kib} instance. Some {kib} operations
return all spaces using a single `_search` from {es}, so you must
configure this setting lower than the `index.max_result_window` in {es}.
The default is `1000`.

`monitoring.cluster_alerts.allowedSpaces` {ess-icon}:: 
Specifies the spaces where cluster alerts are automatically generated. 
You must specify all spaces where you want to generate alerts, including the default space. 
When the default space is unspecified, {kib} is unable to generate an alert for the default space.
{es} clusters that run on {es} services are all containers. To send monitoring data 
from your self-managed {es} installation to {es} services, set to `false`. 
The default is `true`.
