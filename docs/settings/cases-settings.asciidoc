You do not need to configure any additional settings to use <<cases,cases>> in {kib}.
To provide greater control over case features, you can configure the following settings in the `kibana.yml` file:

`xpack.cases.files.allowedMimeTypes`::
The MIME types that you can attach to a case, represented in an array of strings. For example: `['image/tiff','text/csv','application/zip'].`
The default MIME types are specified in {kib-repo}blob/{branch}/x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/cases/common/constants/mime_types.ts[mime_types.ts].

`xpack.cases.files.maxSize`::
The size limit for files that you can attach to a case, represented as the number of bytes. By default, the limit is 10 MiB for images and 100 MiB for all other MIME types. If you specify a value for this setting, it affects all file types.
