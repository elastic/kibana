You do not need to configure any additional settings to use <<cases,cases>> in {kib}.
To provide greater control over case features, you can configure the following settings in the `kibana.yml` file:

`xpack.cases.files.allowedMimeTypes`::
The MIME types that you can attach to a case, represented in an array of strings.
The default MIME types are specified in https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/{branch}/x-pack/plugins/cases/common/constants/mime_types.ts[mime_types.ts].

`xpack.cases.files.maxSize`::
The file size limit for files that you can attach to a case, represented as the number of bytes. Defaults to 10 MiB for images and 100 MiB for all other MIME types.
