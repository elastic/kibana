You can configure `xpack.reporting` settings in your `kibana.yml` to:

* <<reporting-kibana-server-settings,Control how {reporting}  communicates with the {kib} server>>
* <<reporting-job-queue-settings,Manage background jobs>>
* <<reporting-capture-settings,Capture screenshots>>

[[general-reporting-settings]]
==== General Reporting Settings
[[xpack-enable-reporting]]`xpack.reporting.enabled`::
Set to `false` to disable {reporting}.

`xpack.reporting.encryptionKey`::
Set to any text string. By default, Kibana generates a random key when it starts,
which causes pending reports to fail on restart. Configure this setting to use
the same key across restarts.

[float]
[[reporting-kibana-server-settings]]
==== Kibana Server Settings

Reporting uses the Kibana interface to generate reports. In most cases, you don't need
to configure Reporting to communicate with Kibana. However, if you use a reverse-proxy
to access Kibana, you must set the proxy port, protocol, and hostname.

`xpack.reporting.kibanaServer.port`::
The port for accessing Kibana, if different from the `server.port` value.

`xpack.reporting.kibanaServer.protocol`::
The protocol for accessing Kibana, typically `http` or `https`.

`xpack.reporting.kibanaServer.hostname`::
The hostname for accessing Kibana, if different from the `server.name` value.

[[reporting-job-queue-settings]]
==== Background Job Settings

Reporting generates reports in the background and jobs are coordinated using documents
in Elasticsearch. Depending on how often you generate reports and the overall number of
reports, you might need to change the following settings.

`xpack.reporting.queue.indexInterval`::
How often the index that stores reporting jobs rolls over to a new index.
Valid values are `year`, `month`, `week`, `day`, and `hour`. Defaults to `week`.

`xpack.reporting.queue.pollInterval`::
How often idle workers poll the index for pending jobs. Defaults to `3000` (3 seconds).

[[xpack-reporting-q-timeout]]`xpack.reporting.queue.timeout`::
How long each worker has to produce a report. If your machine is slow or under
heavy load, you might need to increase this timeout. Specified in milliseconds.
Defaults to `120000` (two minutes).

[float]
[[reporting-capture-settings]]
==== Capture Settings

Reporting works by capturing screenshots from Kibana. The following settings
control the capturing process.

`xpack.reporting.capture.loadDelay`::
When visualizations are not evented, this is the amount of time before
taking a screenshot. All visualizations that ship with Kibana are evented, so this
setting should not have much effect. If you are seeing empty images instead of
visualizations, try increasing this value.
Defaults to `3000` (3 seconds).

[[xpack-reporting-browser]]`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.type`::
Specifies the browser to use to capture screenshots. Valid options are `phantom`
and `chromium`. When `chromium` is set, the settings specified in the <<reporting-chromium-settings, Chromium settings>>
are respected.
Defaults to `phantom`.

[float]
[[reporting-chromium-settings]]
==== Chromium Settings

When `xpack.reporting.capture.browser.type` is set to `chromium` you can also specify the following settings.

`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.disableSandbox`::
Elastic recommends that you research the feasibility of enabling unprivileged user namespaces. 
See Chromium Sandbox for additional information. Defaults to false for all operating systems except Debian,
Red Hat Linux, and CentOS which use true

`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.proxy.enabled`::
Enables the proxy for Chromium to use. When set to `true`, you must also specify the
`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.proxy.server` setting.
Defaults to `false`

`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.proxy.server`::
The uri for the proxy server. Providing the username and password for the proxy server via the uri is not supported.

`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.proxy.bypass`::
An array of hosts that should not go through the proxy server and should use a direct connection instead.
Examples of valid entries are "elastic.co", "*.elastic.co", ".elastic.co", ".elastic.co:5601"


[float]
[[reporting-csv-settings]]
==== CSV Settings
[[xpack-reporting-csv]]`xpack.reporting.csv.maxSizeBytes`::
The maximum size of a CSV file before being truncated. This setting exists to prevent
large exports from causing performance and storage issues.
Defaults to `10485760` (10mB)

[float]
[[reporting-advanced-settings]]
==== Advanced Settings

`xpack.reporting.index`::
Reporting uses a weekly index in Elasticsearch to store the reporting job and the report
content. The index is automatically created if it does not already exist.
Defaults to `.reporting`

`xpack.reporting.roles.allow`::
Specifies the roles in addition to superusers that are allowed to access reporting.
Defaults to `[ "reporting_user" ]`
