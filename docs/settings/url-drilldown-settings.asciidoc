Configure the URL drilldown settings in your `kibana.yml` configuration file.

[[external-URL-policy]] `externalUrl.policy`::
Configures the external URL policies. URL drilldowns respect the global *External URL* service, which you can use to deny or allow external URLs.
By default all external URLs are allowed.
+
For example, to allow only external URLs to the `example.com` domain with the `https` scheme, except for the `danger.example.com` sub-domain,
which is denied even when `https` scheme is used:
+
["source","yml"]
-----------
externalUrl.policy:
  - allow: false
    host: danger.example.com
  - allow: true
    host: example.com
    protocol: https
