Configure the URL drilldown settings in your `kibana.yml` configuration file.

[cols="2*<"]
|===
| [[url-drilldown-enabled]] `url_drilldown.enabled`
 | When `true`, enables URL drilldowns on your {kib} instance.

| [[external-URL-policy]] `externalUrl.policy`
 | Configures the external URL policies. URL drilldowns respect the global *External URL* service, which you can use to deny or allow external URLs.
By default all external URLs are allowed.
|===

For example, to allow external URLs only to the `example.com` domain with the `https` scheme, except for the `danger.example.com` sub-domain,
which is denied even when `https` scheme is used:

["source","yml"]
-----------
externalUrl.policy:
  - allow: false
    host: danger.example.com
  - allow: true
    host: example.com
    protocol: https
