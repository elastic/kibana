=== Inspecting the data

The visualizations form a picture of the Flight data, but sometimes you need to 
view the raw data. Perhaps something in the visualization doesn’t seem right 
or maybe you want to know what’s going on behind the scenes.
You can inspect the data that is being used to create a visualization.

. Hover the pointer over the *Flight Count and Average Ticket Price* visualization.
. Click the icon in the upper right. 
. From the *Options* menu, select *Inspect*.

You can also look at the query used to fetch the data for the visualization. 

. Open the *View: Data* menu and select *Requests*. 
. Click the tabs to look at the request statistics, the raw Elasticsearch request, 
and the response in JSON. 
. To close the editor, click X in the upper right.
