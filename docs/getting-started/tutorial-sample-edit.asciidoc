=== Editing a visualization

You have edit permissions for the *Global Flight* dashboard so you can change 
the appearance and behavior of the visualizations. For example, you might want 
to see which airline has the lowest average fares.

. Go to the *Global Flight* dashboard. 
. In the menu bar, click *Edit*.
. In the *Average Ticket Price* visualization, click the gear icon in 
the upper right.
. From the *Options* menu, select *Edit visualization*.

==== Edit a metric visualization 

*Average Ticket Price* is a metric visualization.
To specify which groups to display 
in this visualization, you use an {es} {ref}/search-aggregations.html[bucket aggregation]. 
This aggregation sorts the documents that match your search criteria into different 
categories, or buckets.

. In the *Buckets* pane, select *Split Group*.
. In the *Aggregation* dropdown menu, select *Terms*.
. In the *Field* dropdown, select *Carrier*.
. Set *Descending* to four.
. Click *Apply changes* image:images/apply-changes-button.png[].

You now see the average ticket price for all four airlines.
