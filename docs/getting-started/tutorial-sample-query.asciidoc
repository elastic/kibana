=== Querying the data

You can enter an {es} query to narrow the view of the data.

. To find all flights out of Rome, submit this query:
+
[source,text]
OriginCityName:Rome   

. For a more complex query with AND and OR, try this:
+
[source,text]
OriginCityName:Rome AND (Carrier:JetBeats OR "Kibana Airlines")
+
The dashboard updates to show data for the flights out of Rome on JetBeats and 
{kib} Airlines.

. When you are finished exploring the dashboard, remove the query by 
clearing the contents in the query bar and pressing Enter.

In general, filters are faster than queries. For more information, see {ref}/query-filter-context.html[Query and filter context].

TIP: {kib} has an experimental autocomplete feature that can 
help jumpstart your queries. To turn on this feature, click *Options* on the 
right of the query bar and opt in. With autocomplete enabled, 
search suggestions are displayed when you start typing your query.
