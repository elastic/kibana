=== Querying the data

You can also enter an {es} query to narrow the view of the data.  {kib} supports the 
<<lucene-query>>.

. In the query bar, enter this simple query:
+
[source,text]
OriginCityName:Rome   
+
The dashboard now shows data for flights out of Rome. 

. For a more complex query with AND and OR, try this:
+
[source,text]
OriginCityName:Rome AND (Carrier:JetBeats OR "Kibana Airlines")
+
The dashboard updates to show data for the flights out of Rome on JetBeats and 
{kib} Airlines.

. When you are finished exploring the dashboard, remove the query by 
clearing the contents in the query bar and pressing Enter.

In general, filters are faster than queries because filters are cached and don’t 
influence the score. For more information, see {ref}/query-filter-context.html[Query and filter context].

TIP: {kib} has two experimental features, autocomplete and simple syntax, that can 
help jumpstart your queries. To turn on these features, click *Options* on the 
right of the query bar and opt-in. Just start typing in the query bar and you’ll 
get search suggestions.  For information on the simplified syntax, see 
<<kuery-query>>.
