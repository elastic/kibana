=== Inspecting the data

Seeing visualizations of your data is great, 
but sometimes you need to look at the actual data to
understand what's really going on. You can inspect the data behind any visualization
and view the {es} query used to retrieve it.

. In the dashboard, hover the pointer over the pie chart.
. Click the icon in the upper right. 
. From the *Options* menu, select *Inspect*.

You can also look at the query used to fetch the data for the visualization. 

. Open the *View:Data* menu and select *Requests*. 
. Click the tabs to look at the request statistics, the Elasticsearch request, 
and the response in JSON. 
. To close the Inspector, click X in the upper right.
