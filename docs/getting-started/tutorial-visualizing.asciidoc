== Data Visualization: Beyond Discovery

The visualization tools available on the *Visualize* tab enable you to display aspects of your data sets in several
different ways.

Click on the *Visualize* image:images/visualize-icon.png[Bar chart icon] tab to start:

Click on *Pie chart*, then *From a new search*. Select the `ba*` index pattern.

Visualizations depend on Elasticsearch {es-ref}search-aggregations.html[aggregations] in two different types: _bucket_
aggregations and _metric_ aggregations. A bucket aggregation sorts your data according to criteria you specify. For
example, in our accounts data set, we can establish a range of account balances, then display what proportions of the
total fall into which range of balances.

The whole pie displays, since we  haven't specified any buckets yet.

Select *Split Slices* from the *Select buckets type* list, then select *Range* from the *Aggregation* drop-down
selector. Select the *balance* field from the *Field* drop-down, then click on *Add Range* four times to bring the
total number of ranges to six. Enter the following ranges:

[source,text]
0             999
1000         2999
3000         6999
7000        14999
15000       30999
31000       50000

Click the *Apply changes* button image:images/apply-changes-button.png[] to display the chart:

This shows you what proportion of the 1000 accounts fall in these balance ranges. To see another dimension of the data,
we're going to add another bucket aggregation. We can break down each of the balance ranges further by the account
holder's age.

Click *Add sub-buckets* at the bottom, then select *Split Slices*. Choose the *Terms* aggregation and the *age* field from
the drop-downs.
Click the  *Apply changes* button image:images/apply-changes-button.png[] to add an external ring with the new
results.

Save this chart by clicking the *Save Visualization* button to the right of the search field. Name the visualization
_Pie Example_.

Next, we're going to make a bar chart. Click on *New Visualization*, then *Vertical bar chart*. Select *From a new
search* and the `shakes*` index pattern. You'll see a single big bar, since we haven't defined any buckets yet:

image::images/tutorial-visualize-bar-1.png[]

For the Y-axis metrics aggregation, select *Unique Count*, with *speaker* as the field. For Shakespeare plays, it might
be useful to know which plays have the lowest number of distinct speaking parts, if your theater company is short on
actors. For the X-Axis buckets, select the *Terms* aggregation with the *play_name* field. For the *Order*, select
*Ascending*, leaving the *Size* at 5. Write a description for the axes in the *Custom Label* fields.

Leave the other elements at their default values and click the *Apply changes* button
image:images/apply-changes-button.png[]. Your chart should now look like this:

image::images/tutorial-visualize-bar-2.png[]

Notice how the individual play names show up as whole phrases, instead of being broken down into individual words. This
is the result of the mapping we did at the beginning of the tutorial, when we marked the *play_name* field as 'not
analyzed'.

Hovering on each bar shows you the number of speaking parts for each play as a tooltip. You can turn this behavior off,
as well as change many other options for your visualizations, by clicking the *Options* tab in the top left.

Now that you have a list of the smallest casts for Shakespeare plays, you might also be curious to see which of these
plays makes the greatest demands on an individual actor by showing the maximum number of speeches for a given part. Add
a Y-axis aggregation with the *Add metrics* button, then choose the *Max* aggregation for the *speech_number* field. In
the *Options* tab, change the *Bar Mode* drop-down to *grouped*, then click the  *Apply changes* button
image:images/apply-changes-button.png[]. Your chart should now look like this:

image::images/tutorial-visualize-bar-3.png[]

As you can see, _Love's Labours Lost_ has an unusually high maximum speech number, compared to the other plays, and
might therefore make more demands on an actor's memory.

Note how the *Number of speaking parts* Y-axis starts at zero, but the bars don't begin to differentiate until 18. To
make the differences stand out, starting the Y-axis at a value closer to the minimum, check the
*Scale Y-Axis to data bounds* box in the *Options* tab.

Save this chart with the name _Bar Example_.

Next, we're going to make a tile map chart to visualize some geographic data. Click on *New Visualization*, then
*Tile map*. Select *From a new search* and the `logstash-*` index pattern. Define the time window for the events
we're exploring by clicking the time selector at the top right of the Kibana interface. Click on *Absolute*, then set
the start time to May 18, 2015 and the end time for the range to May 20, 2015:

image::images/tutorial-timepicker.png[]

Once you've got the time range set up, click the *Go* button, then close the time picker by clicking the small up arrow
at the bottom. You'll see a map of the world, since we haven't defined any buckets yet:

image::images/tutorial-visualize-map-1.png[]

Select *Geo Coordinates* as the bucket, then click the *Apply changes* button image:images/apply-changes-button.png[].
Your chart should now look like this:

image::images/tutorial-visualize-map-2.png[]

You can navigate the map by clicking and dragging, zoom with the image:images/viz-zoom.png[] buttons, or hit the *Fit
Data Bounds* image:images/viz-fit-bounds.png[] button to zoom to the lowest level that includes all the points. You can
also create a filter to define a rectangle on the map, either to include or exclude, by clicking the
*Latitude/Longitude Filter* image:images/viz-lat-long-filter.png[] button and drawing a bounding box on the map.
A green oval with the filter definition displays right under the query box:

image::images/tutorial-visualize-map-3.png[]

Hover on the filter to display the controls to toggle, pin, invert, or delete the filter. Save this chart with the name
_Map Example_.

Finally, we're going to define a sample Markdown widget to display on our dashboard. Click on *New Visualization*, then
*Markdown widget*, to display a very simple Markdown entry field:

image::images/tutorial-visualize-md-1.png[]

Write the following text in the field:

[source,markdown]
# This is a tutorial dashboard!
The Markdown widget uses **markdown** syntax.
> Blockquotes in Markdown use the > character.

Click the  *Apply changes* button image:images/apply-changes-button.png[] to display the rendered Markdown in the
preview pane:

image::images/tutorial-visualize-md-2.png[]

Save this visualization with the name _Markdown Example_.
