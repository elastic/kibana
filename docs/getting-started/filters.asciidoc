== Filter the data

To view a subset of the documents, create filters. {kib} combines the results from the filters you apply to the queries. Each filter can be disabled, inverted, or pinned across apps.  

Filters are the only way to use the {es} Query DSL in JSON form, or to target a specific index pattern for filtering.
