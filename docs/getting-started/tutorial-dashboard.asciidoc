You can rearrange the visualizations by clicking a the header of a
visualization and dragging. The gear icon in the top right of a visualization
displays controls for editing and deleting the visualization.  A resize control
is on the lower right.

. *Save* your dashboard.

==== Inspect the data

Seeing visualizations of your data is great,
but sometimes you need to look at the actual data to
understand what's really going on. You can inspect the data behind any visualization
and view the {es} query used to retrieve it.

. Click the pie chart *Options* menu, then select *Inspect*.
