== Putting it all Together with Dashboards

A dashboard is a collection of visualizations that you can arrange and share. 
To build a dashboard that contains the visualizations you saved during this tutorial:

. Click *Dashboard* in the side navigation.
. Click *Add* to display the list of saved visualizations. 
. Click _Markdown Example_, _Pie Example_, _Bar Example_, and _Map Example_, then close the list of
visualizations by clicking the small up-arrow at the bottom of the list. 

Hovering over a visualization displays the container controls that enable you to
edit, move, delete, and resize the visualization. 

Your sample dashboard should end up looking roughly like this:

To get a link to share or HTML code to embed the dashboard in a web page, save
the dashboard and click  *Share*.
