== Putting it all Together with Dashboards

A Kibana dashboard is a collection of visualizations that you can arrange and share. To get started, click the
*Dashboard* tab, then the *Add Visualization* button at the far right of the search box to display the list of saved
visualizations. Select _Markdown Example_, _Pie Example_, _Bar Example_, and _Map Example_, then close the list of
visualizations by clicking the small up-arrow at the bottom of the list. You can move the containers for each
visualization by clicking and dragging the title bar. Resize the containers by dragging the lower right corner of a
visualization's container. Your sample dashboard should end up looking roughly like this:

Click the *Save Dashboard* button, then name the dashboard _Tutorial Dashboard_. You can share a saved dashboard by
clicking the *Share* button to display HTML embedding code as well as a direct link.
