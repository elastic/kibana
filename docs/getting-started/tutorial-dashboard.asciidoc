=== Add visualizations to a dashboard

A dashboard is a collection of visualizations that you can arrange and share.
You'll build a dashboard that contains the visualizations and map that you saved during
this tutorial.

. Open *Dashboard*.
. On the Dashboard overview page, click *Create new dashboard*.
. Set the time filter to May 18, 2015 to May 20, 2015.
. Click *Add* in the menu bar.
. Add *Bar Example*, *Map Example*, *Markdown Example*, and *Pie Example*.
+
Your sample dashboard should look like this:
+
[role="screenshot"]

. Try out the editing controls.
+
You can rearrange the visualizations by clicking a the header of a
visualization and dragging. The gear icon in the top right of a visualization
displays controls for editing and deleting the visualization.  A resize control
is on the lower right.

. *Save* your dashboard.

==== Inspect the data

Seeing visualizations of your data is great,
but sometimes you need to look at the actual data to
understand what's really going on. You can inspect the data behind any visualization
and view the {es} query used to retrieve it.

. In the dashboard, hover the pointer over the pie chart, and then click the icon in the upper right.
. From the *Options* menu, select *Inspect*.

. To look at the query used to fetch the data for the visualization, select *View > Requests*
in the upper right of the Inspect pane.
