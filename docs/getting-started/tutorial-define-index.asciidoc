=== Defining your index patterns

Index patterns tell Kibana which Elasticsearch indices you want to explore.
An index pattern can match the name of a single index, or include a wildcard
(*) to match multiple indices.

For example, Logstash typically creates a
series of indices in the format `logstash-YYYY.MMM.DD`. To explore all
of the log data from May 2018, you could specify the index pattern
`logstash-2018.05*`.

You'll create patterns for the Shakespeare data set, which has an
index named `shakespeare,` and the accounts data set, which has an index named
`bank.` These data sets don't contain time-series data.

. In Kibana, open *Management*, and then click *Index Patterns.*
. If this is your first index pattern, the *Create index pattern* page opens automatically.
Otherwise, click *Create index pattern* in the upper left.
. Enter `shakes*` in the *Index pattern* field.

. Click *Next step*.
. In *Configure settings*, click *Create index pattern*.  For this pattern,
you don't need to configure any settings.
. Define a second index pattern named  `ba*` You don't need to configure any settings for this pattern.

Now create an index pattern for the Logstash data set. This data set
contains time-series data.

. Define an index pattern named `logstash*`.
. Click *Next step*.
. In *Configure settings*, select *@timestamp* in the *Time Filter field name* dropdown menu.
. Click *Create index pattern*.




NOTE: When you define an index pattern, the indices that match that pattern must
exist in Elasticsearch and they must contain data. To check which indices are
available, go to *Dev Tools > Console* and enter `GET _cat/indices`.  Alternately, use
`curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices"`.
