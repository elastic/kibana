=== Define your index patterns

Index patterns tell {kib} which {es} indices you want to explore.
An index pattern can match the name of a single index, or include a wildcard
(*) to match multiple indices. 

For example, Logstash typically creates a
series of indices in the format `logstash-YYYY.MMM.DD`. To explore all
of the log data from May 2018, you could specify the index pattern
`logstash-2018.05*`.

==== Create the index patterns

First you'll create index patterns for the Shakespeare data set, which has an
index named `shakespeare,` and the accounts data set, which has an index named
`bank`. These data sets don't contain time series data.

. Open the menu, then go to *Stack Management > {kib} > Index Patterns*.

. If this is your first index pattern, the *Create index pattern* page opens.

. In the *Index pattern name* field, enter `shakes*`.
