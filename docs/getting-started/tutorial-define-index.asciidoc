== Defining Your Index Patterns

An index pattern tells Kibana which Elasticsearch indices you want to explore.
Your index pattern can include a wildcard to match multiple indices.  For example,
in the common logging use case, an Elasticsearch index name typically contains the date in
YYYY.MMM.DD format.  The matching index pattern for May 2018 might
be `logstash-2018.05*`.

We'll start by creating patterns for the Shakespeare data set, which has an
index named `shakespeare,` and the accounts data set, which has an index named
`bank.` These data sets don't contain time-series data.

. In Kibana, open *Management*, and then click *Index Patterns.*
. If this is your first index pattern, the *Create index pattern* page opens automatically.
Otherwise, click *Create index pattern* in the upper left.
. Enter `shakes*` in the *Index pattern* field.

. Click *Next step*.
. In *Configure settings*, click *Create index pattern*.  For this pattern,
you don't need to configure any settings.
. Define a second index pattern named  `ba*`.

Next, we'll create an index pattern for the Logstash data set. This time,
you'll need to configure the time-series data.

. Define an index pattern named `logstash*`.
. In *Configure settings*, select *@timestamp* in the *Time Filter field name* dropdown menu.
. Click *Create index pattern*.


NOTE: When you define an index pattern, the indices that match that pattern must
exist in Elasticsearch and they must contain data. To check which indices are
available, go to *Dev Tools > Console* and enter `GET _cat/indices`.
