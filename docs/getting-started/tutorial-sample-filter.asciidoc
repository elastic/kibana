=== Filtering the data

Many visualizations in the *Global Flight* dashboard are interactive. They offer 
mouse clicks and other controls for you to filter the view of the data. Filters 
are global&mdash;a change in one visualization simultaneously changes the data 
in every visualization on the dashboard.

. In the *Controls* visualization, set an *Origin City* and a *Destination City*.
. Click *Apply changes*.
+
The `OriginCityName` and the `DestCityName` fields are filtered to match 
the data you specified. 
+
For example, this dashboard shows the data for flights from London to Newark
and Pittsburgh.

. Remove the filters by hovering your pointer over their labels in the filter bar
and clicking the trash can icon. 

You can also add filters manually.  In the filter bar, click *Add a Filter*
and then specify the data you want to view.
