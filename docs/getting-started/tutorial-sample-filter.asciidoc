Many visualizations in the *Global Flight* dashboard are interactive. You can 
apply filters to modify the view of the data across all visualizations.

. In the *Controls* visualization, set an *Origin City* and a *Destination City*.
. Click *Apply changes*.
+
The `OriginCityName` and the `DestCityName` fields are filtered to match 
the data you specified.

For example, this dashboard shows the data for flights from London to Newark
and Pittsburgh.
