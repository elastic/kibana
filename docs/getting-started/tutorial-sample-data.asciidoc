= Tutorial: Explore {kib} using sample data

[partintro]
--

Ready to try out {kib}? You can quickly get up and running by setting up on Cloud, then add a sample data set to explore the full range of {kib} features.

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll work with {kib} sample data to learn how to:

* <<explore-the-data, Explore the data using *Discover*>>

* <<view-and-analyze-the-data, View and analyze the data on a dashboard>>

* <<filter-and-query-the-data, Filter and query the dashboard data>>

NOTE: If security is enabled, you must have `read`, `write`, and `manage` privileges
on the `kibana_sample_data_*` indices. For more information, refer to
{ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges].

[[add-the-sample-data]]
=== Add the sample data

The easiest way to get data into {kib} is to add a sample data set.

{kib} has the following sample data sets that you can use before you load your own data:

* *Sample eCommerce orders* includes visualizations for tracking product-related information,
such as cost, revenue, and price.

* *Sample flight data* includes visualizations for monitoring flight routes.

* *Sample web logs* includes visualizations for monitoring website traffic.

For this tutorial, you'll add the *Sample eCommerce orders* data:

. Go to the home page.

. Click *Try our sample data*.

. On the *Sample eCommerce orders* card, click *Add data*.

NOTE: The timestamps in the sample data sets are relative to when they are installed.
When you uninstall and reinstall a data set, the timestamp changes to reflect the most recent installation.

[[explore-the-data]]
=== Explore the data

With *Discover*, you use {ref}/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax[Elasticsearch
queries] to explore your data, also referred to as documents, and narrow the results with filters. *Discover* displays an interactive  histogram that shows the distribution of 
documents over time, and a table that lists the fields for each document that matches the index.

. Open the menu, then go to *Discover*.
+
The `kibana_sample_data_ecommerce` index pattern appears. By default, all fields are shown for each matching document.

. To expand the time range, change the <<set-time-filter, time filter>> to *Last 7 days*.

. In the *Search* field, enter the following:
+
[source,text]
products.taxless_price >= 60 AND category : Women's Clothing
+
The search returns all women's clothing orders for $60 and greater.
+

. Hover over the list of *Available fields*, then
click *+* next to the fields you want to view.
+
For example, when you add the `category` field, the table displays the product categories for the orders.

[[view-and-analyze-the-data]]
=== View and analyze the data

Now that you know what your documents contain, it's time to gain insight with *Dashboard*. 
A _dashboard_ is a collection of panels that you can 
use to analyze your data. Panels contain everything you need, including visualizations, 
interactive controls, Markdown, and more.

To begin, open the menu, go to *Dashboard*, then click *[eCommerce] Revenue Dashboard*.

==== Change the dashboard data

Change the appearance and behavior of the panels on your dashboard.

. In the {kib} toolbar, click *Edit*.

. From the *[eCommerce] Average Sales Price* donut chart panel, open the panel menu, then select *Edit visualization*.

. To change the data on the panel, use an {es} {ref}/search-aggregations.html[bucket aggregation],  
which sorts the documents that match your search criteria into different categories or buckets.

.. In the *Buckets* pane, click *Add > Split group*.

.. From the *Aggregation* dropdown, select *Terms*.

.. From the *Field* dropdown, select *products.price*.

.. Set *Descending* to *3*, then click *Update*.

[[filter-and-query-the-data]]
==== Filter and query the data

To focus in on the data you want to explore, use filters and queries. 
For more information, refer to {ref}/query-filter-context.html[Query and filter context].

To filter the data:

. In the *Controls* visualization, select a *Manufacturer* and *Category*, then click *Apply changes*.
+
For example, the following dashboard shows the data for women's clothing from Gnomehouse. 
+

image::getting-started/images/tutorial-sample-filter.png[]

. To manually add a filter, click *Add filter*, then specify the data you want to view.
+
For example, if you want to only view the orders for Wednesday, select *day_of_week* from the *Field* dropdown, select *is* from the *Operator* dropdown, then select *Wednesday* from the *Value* dropdown.
+
[role="screenshot"]

. When you are finished experimenting, remove the filters.

[[query-the-data]]
To query the data:

. To view all data from the Gnomehouse manufacturer, enter the following in the *KQL* query bar:
+
[source,text]
manufacturer: Gnomehouse

. For a more complex query with AND and OR, enter:
+
[source,text]
manufacturer: Gnomehouse AND (manufacturer: Low Tide Media OR manufacturer: Tigress Enterprises)
+
The dashboard panels update to display the flights out of Rome on JetBeats and 
{kib} Airlines.
