= Tutorial: Explore {kib} using sample data

[partintro]
--

Ready to try out {kib}? You can quickly get up and running by setting up on Cloud, then add a sample data set to explore the full range of {kib} features.

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll work with {kib} sample data to learn how to:

* <<explore-the-data, Explore the data using *Discover*>>

* <<view-and-analyze-the-data, View and analyze the data on a dashboard>>

* <<filter-and-query-the-data, Filter and query the dashboard data>>

NOTE: If security is enabled, you must have `read`, `write`, and `manage` privileges
on the `kibana_sample_data_*` indices. For more information, refer to
{ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges].

[[add-the-sample-data]]
=== Add the sample data

The easiest way to get data into {kib} is to add a sample data set.

{kib} has several sample data sets that you can use before you load your own data. For this tutorial, you'll add the *Sample eCommerce orders* data.

. Go to the home page.

. Click *Try our sample data*.

. On the *Sample eCommerce orders* card, click *Add data*.

NOTE: The timestamps in the sample data sets are relative to when they are installed.
When you uninstall and reinstall a data set, the timestamp changes to reflect the most recent installation.

[[explore-the-data]]
=== Explore the data

With *Discover*, you use {ref}/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax[Elasticsearch
queries] to explore your data, also referred to as documents, and narrow the results with filters. *Discover* displays an interactive  histogram that shows the distribution of 
documents over time, and a table that lists the fields for each document that matches the index.

. Open the menu, then click *Discover*.
+
By default, all fields are shown for each matching document.

[source,text]
products.taxless_price >= 60 AND category : Women's Clothing
+
The search returns all women's clothing orders for $60 and greater.
+

. Hover over the list of *Available fields*, then
click *+* next to the fields you want to view.

[[view-and-analyze-the-data]]
=== View and analyze the data

Gain insight into your data with *Dashboard*. A _dashboard_ is a collection of panels that you can

interactive controls, Markdown, and more. For this tutorial, you'll use the *[eCommerce] Revenue Dashboard*.

. Open the menu, then click *Dashboard*.
. Click *[eCommerce] Revenue Dashboard*.

[[filter-and-query-the-data]]
==== Filter and query the data

To focus in on the data you want to explore, use filters and queries. 
For more information, refer to {ref}/query-filter-context.html[Query and filter context].

To filter the data:

. In the *Controls* visualization, select a *Manufacturer* and *Category*, then click *Apply changes*.

[source,text]
manufacturer: Gnomehouse AND (category: Women's Clothing OR category: Women's Shoes)
