=== Discovering your data

Using the Discover application, you can enter
an {ref}/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax[Elasticsearch
query] to search your data and filter the results.

. Open *Discover*.
+
The current index pattern appears below the filter bar, in this case `shakes*`.
You might need to click *New* in the menu bar to refresh the data.

. Click the caret to the right of the current index pattern, and select `ba*`.
. In the search field, enter the following string:
+
[source,text]
account_number<100 AND balance>47500

The search returns all account numbers between zero and 99 with balances in
excess of 47,500. It returns results for account numbers 8, 32, 78, 85, and 97.

By default, all fields are shown for each matching document. To choose which
fields to display, hover the pointer over the list of *Available Fields*
and then click *add* next to each field you want include as a column in the table.

For example, if you add the `account_number` field, the display changes to a list of five
account numbers.
