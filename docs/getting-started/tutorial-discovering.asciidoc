== Discovering Your Data

Now let's use the Discover application to explore the accounts index.  We'll submit
an {ref}/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax[Elasticsearch
query] and filter our results.

. Open *Discover*. You'll see that shakes* is the current index pattern.
. Click the caret to the right of shakes*, and select `ba*`.
. In the search field, enter the following string:
+
[source,text]
account_number:<100 AND balance:>47500

The search returns all account numbers between zero and 99 with balances in
excess of 47,500. It returns results for account numbers 8, 32, 78, 85, and 97.

By default, all fields are shown for each matching document. To choose which
fields to display, hover your mouse over the the list of *Available Fields*
and then click *add* next to each field you want include.

For example, if you add the `account_number` field, the display changes to a list of five
account numbers.
