Click the *Discover* image:images/discover-compass.png[Compass icon] tab to display Kibana's data discovery functions:

Right under the tab itself, there is a search box where you can search your data. Searches take a specific
{es-ref}query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax[query syntax] that enable you to create custom searches,
which you can save and load by clicking the buttons to the right of the search box.

Beneath the search box, the current index pattern is displayed in a drop-down. You can change the index pattern by
selecting a different pattern from the drop-down selector.

You can construct searches by using the field names and the values you're interested in. With numeric fields you can
use comparison operators such as greater than (>), less than (<), or equals (=). You can link elements with the
logical operators AND, OR, and NOT, all in uppercase.

Try selecting the `ba*` index pattern and putting the following search into the search box:

[source,text]
account_number:<100 AND balance:>47500

This search returns all account numbers between zero and 99 with balances in excess of 47,500.

If you're using the linked sample data set, this search returns 5 results: Account numbers 8, 32, 78, 85, and 97.

To narrow the display to only the specific fields of interest, highlight each field in the list that displays under the
index pattern and click the *Add* button. Note how, in this example, adding the `account_number` field changes the
display from the full text of five records to a simple list of five account numbers:
