=== Using Discover

Another way to interactively explore your data is in the Discover application.   
Here the data is presented as a table of documents.  As in the Dashboard application, 
you can submit search queries and filter the search results. 

. In the side navigation, select *Discover*.

The current index pattern appears below the filter bar. An
index patterns tell {kib} which {es} indices you want to explore.
Youâ€™ll learn more about index patterns in the next tutorial, 
<<tutorial-your-data>>.

. If *kibana_sample_data_flights* isn't the current index pattern, go to the menu
bar and select *New* to clear the current data. Then click the caret to the right of the current index pattern 
and select *kibana_sample_data_flights*. 

A time field is configured for the *kibana_sample_data_flights* index pattern. 
You'll see the distribution of documents over time in a histogram.

hover the pointer over the the list of *Available Fields* and then click *add* next 
to each field you want include.
