=== Using Discover

In the Discover application, the Flight data is presented in a table. You can 
interactively explore the data, including searching and filtering.

* In the side navigation, select *Discover*.

The current index pattern appears below the filter bar. An
<<index-patterns, index pattern>> tells {kib} which {es} indices you want to 
explore.

The `kibana_sample_data_flights` index contains a time field. A histogram
shows the distribution of documents over time.

By default, all fields are shown for each matching document. To choose which fields to display, 
hover the pointer over the the list of *Available Fields* and then click *add* next 
to each field you want include as a column in the table.

For example, if you add the `DestAirportID` and `DestWeather` fields, 
the display includes columns for those two fields:
