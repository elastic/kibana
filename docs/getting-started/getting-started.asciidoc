**_Learn the shared concepts for analyzing and visualizing your data_**

As an analyst, you will use a combination of {kib} apps to analyze and
visualize your data. {kib} contains both general-purpose apps and apps for the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/index.html[*Enterprise Search*],
{observability-guide}/observability-introduction.html[*Elastic Observability*],
and {security-guide}/es-overview.html[*Elastic Security*] solutions.
These apps share a common set of concepts.

=== Three things to know about {es}

You don't need to know everything about {es} to use {kib}, but the most important concepts follow:

* *{es} makes JSON documents searchable and aggregatable.* The documents are
stored in an {ref}/documents-indices.html[index] or {ref}/data-streams.html[data stream], which represent one type of data.

* **_Searchable_ means that you can filter the documents for conditions.**
For example, you can filter for data "within the last 7 days" or data that "contains the word {kib}".
{kib} provides many ways for you to construct filters, which are also called queries or search terms.

* **_Aggregatable_ means that you can extract summaries from matching documents.**
The simplest aggregation is *count*, and it is frequently used in combination
with the *date histogram*, to see count over time. The *terms* aggregation shows the most frequent values.

=== Accessing data with index patterns

{kib} requires an index pattern to tell it which {es} data you want to access,
and whether the data is time-based. An index pattern can point to one or more {es}
data streams, indices, or index aliases by name.
For example, `logs-elasticsearch-prod-*` is an index pattern,
and it is time-based with a time field of `@timestamp`. The time field is not editable.

Index patterns are typically created by an administrator when sending data to {es}.
You can <<index-patterns,create or update index patterns>> in *Stack Management*, or by using a script
that accesses the {kib} API.

{kib} uses the index pattern to show you a list of fields, such as
`event.duration`. You can customize the display name and format for each field.
For example, you can tell {kib} to display `event.duration` in seconds.
{kib} has <<managing-fields,field formatters>> for strings,
dates, geopoints, and numbers.

[[explore-the-data]]
== Explore the data with Discover

*Discover* displays the data in an interactive histogram that shows the distribution of data, or documents, over time, and a table that lists the fields for each document that matches the index pattern. To view a subset of the documents, you can apply filters to the data, and customize the table to display only the fields you want to explore.

. Open the main menu, then click *Discover*.

. Change the <<set-time-filter, time filter>> to *Last 7 days*.

. To view the sales orders for women's clothing that are $60 or more, use the <<kuery-query,*KQL*>> search field:
+
[source,text]
products.taxless_price >= 60 and category : Women's Clothing
+
[role="screenshot"]

. To view only the product categories that contain sales orders, hover over the *category* field, then click *+*.

[[view-and-analyze-the-data]]
== View and analyze the data on a dashboard 

A dashboard is a collection of panels that you can use to view and analyze the data. Panels contain visualizations, interactive controls, text, and more.

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard*. 

. Click *[eCommerce] Revenue Dashboard*.

[[create-a-visualization]]
=== Create a visualization panel

Create a treemap panel that shows the top sales regions and manufacturers, then add the panel to the dashboard.

. From the toolbar, click *Edit*, then click *Create visualzation*.

. Open the *Chart type* menu, then select *Treemap*.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop the following fields onto the workspace:

* *geoip.city_name*

* *manufacturer.keyword*
+

. Click *Save and return*.

The treemap appears as the last visualization panel on the dashboard.

[[interact-with-the-data]]
=== Interact with the data

You can interact with the dashboard data using controls that allow you to apply dashboard-level filters. Interact with the *[eCommerce] Controls* panel to view the women's clothing data from the Gnomehouse manufacturer. 

. From the *Manufacturer* dropdown, select *Gnomehouse*.

. From the *Category* dropdown, select *Women's Clothing*.

. Click *Apply changes*.

[[filter-and-query-the-data]]
=== Filter the data

To view a subset of the data, you can apply filters to the dashboard panels. Apply a filter to view the women's clothing data generated on Wednesday from the Gnomehouse manufacturer.

. Click *Add filter*.

. From the *Field* dropdown, select *day_of_week*.

. From the *Operator* dropdown, select *is*.

. From the *Value* dropdown, select *Wednesday*.

. Click *Save*.
