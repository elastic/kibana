== Get up and running with sample data

{kib} has three sample data sets that you can use to explore {kib} before loading your own data 
source. Each set is prepackaged with a dashboard of visualizations and a 
{kibana-ref}/canvas-getting-started.html[Canvas workpad].

The sample data sets address common use cases:

* *eCommerce orders* includes visualizations for product-related information, 
such as cost, revenue, and price. 
* *Web logs* lets you analyze website traffic. 
* *Flight data* enables you to view and interact with flight routes for four airlines. 

To get started, go to the home page and click the link next to *Add sample data*.

Once you have loaded a data set, click *View data* to view visualizations in *Dashboard*.

*Note:* The timestamps in the sample data sets are relative to when they are installed. 
If you uninstall and reinstall a data set, the timestamps will change to reflect the most recent installation.
