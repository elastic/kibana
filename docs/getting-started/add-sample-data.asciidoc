== Get up and running with sample data

{kib} has several sample data sets that you can use to explore {kib} before loading your own data.
Sample data sets install prepackaged visualizations, dashboards,
{kibana-ref}/canvas-getting-started.html[Canvas workpads],
and {kibana-ref}/maps.html[Maps].

The sample data sets showcase a variety of use cases:

* *eCommerce orders* includes visualizations for product-related information,
such as cost, revenue, and price.
* *Web logs* lets you analyze website traffic.
* *Flight data* enables you to view and interact with flight routes for four airlines.

To get started, go to the home page and click the link next to *Add sample data*.

Once you have loaded a data set, click *View data* to view visualizations in *Dashboard*.

*Note:* The timestamps in the sample data sets are relative to when they are installed.
If you uninstall and reinstall a data set, the timestamps will change to reflect the most recent installation.
