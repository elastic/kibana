== Add sample data

{kib} has several sample data sets that you can use to explore {kib} before loading your own data.
These sample data sets showcase a variety of use cases:

* *eCommerce orders* includes visualizations for product-related information,
such as cost, revenue, and price.
* *Flight data* enables you to view and interact with flight routes.
* *Web logs* lets you analyze website traffic.

To get started, go to the {kib} home page and click the link underneath *Add sample data*.

Once you've loaded a data set, click *View data* to view prepackaged 
visualizations, dashboards, Canvas workpads, Maps, and Machine Learning jobs.

NOTE: The timestamps in the sample data sets are relative to when they are installed.
If you uninstall and reinstall a data set, the timestamps will change to reflect the most recent installation.
