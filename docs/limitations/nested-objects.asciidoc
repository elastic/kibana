== Aggregations with Nested Objects not Supported

Kibana is not able to perform aggregations across fields containing nested
documents.

[float]
=== Workaround

For simple aggregations (e.g. a `terms` aggregation), you
may consider adding the `include_in_parent` setting to your Elasticsearch
mapping. This creates a flattened version of a field in the nested document at
the parent level.

[source,js]
----------------------------------
{
  "type1": {
    "properties": {
      "users": {
        "type": "nested",
        "include_in_parent": true,
        "properties": {
          "first": { "type": "keyword" },
          "last": { "type": "keyword" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----------------------------------

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
Using `include_in_parent` as a workaround is not a supported. Use it at your
own risk.
