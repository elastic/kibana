== Nested Objects

Kibana cannot perform aggregations across fields that contain nested objects. 
It also cannot search on nested objects when Lucene Query Syntax is used in
the query bar.

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
Using `include_in_parent` or `copy_to` as a workaround is not supported and may stop functioning in future releases.
