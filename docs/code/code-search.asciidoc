==== Typeahead search
The search bar is designed to help you find what you're looking for as quickly as possible. It shows `Symbols`, `Files`, and `Repos` results as you type. Clicking on any result takes you to the definition. You can use the search type dropdown to show all types of results or limit it to a specific search type.

You can further refine the results by using the repo and language filters on the left.

[float]
==== Search filter
You can also use the Search Filters to limit the search scope to certain repos before issuing a query. To search across all repos, remove any applied repo filters. By default, search results are limited to the repo you're currently viewing.
