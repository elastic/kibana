==== View file structure and information
The *File* tree on the left is the major way for you to navigate through your folder structure.  When you are on a directory, *Code* also presents a finder-like view on the right. Additionally, a file path breadcrumb makes it easy to go back to any parent directory.

==== Git History and Blame
The *Directory* view shows the most recent commits.  Clicking *View More* or *History* shows the complete commit history of the current folder or file.
