== Getting Started with Code

The easiest way to get started with *Code* is to import a real-world repository into *Code*.

[float]
==== Before you begin
You must have a {kib} instance up and running.

If you are in an environment where you have multiple {kib} instances in a cluster, see <<code-multiple-kibana-instances-config, Config for multiple Kibana instances>>.

[float]
==== Import your first repository
. Navigate to the Code app.

. In *Repository URL*, paste the following GitHub clone URL:
+
[source,bash]
----
https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter
----

. Click *Import*.
+
A list item shows the cloning, then indexing progress of the `TypeScript-Node-Starter` repo.

. After the indexing is complete, navigate to the repo by clicking its name in the list.

Congratulations! You just imported your first repo into *Code*.
