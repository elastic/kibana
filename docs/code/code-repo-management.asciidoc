== Repo management

Code starts with an overview of your repositories.  You can then use the UI to add, delete, and reindex a repo.

==== Add and delete a repo
The <<code-getting-started, Getting Started>> provides step-by-step instructions for adding a GitHub repo to *Code*.  You can fine tune the hostname of the git clone URL in your `kibana.yml` file.

For security reasons, Code allows only a few trusted hostnames, such as github.com, by default. You can add an SSH key to {kib} to clone private repos.

Deleting a repo removes it from local storage and the Elasticsearch index.

==== Reindex a repo
*Code* automatically reindexes an imported repo at set intervals, but in some cases you might need to manually refresh the index. For example, you might refresh an index  after a new language server is installed. Or, you might want to immediately update the index to the HEAD revision. Click *Reindex* to initiate a reindex.

==== Clone URL management
For security reasons, *Code* only allows the following hostnames in the git clone URL by default:

[source,yaml]
----
['github.com', 'gitlab.com', 'bitbucket.org', 'gitbox.apache.org', 'eclipse.org']
----

You can add your own hostname (for example, acme.com) to the whitelist by adding the following line to your `config/kibana.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.code.gitHostWhitelist: [ "github.com", "gitlab.com", "bitbucket.org", "gitbox.apache.org", "eclipse.org", "acme.com" ]
----

Set `xpack.code.gitHostWhitelist` to [] (empty list) allow any hostname.

You can also control the protocol to use for the clone address. By default, the following protocols are supported: `[ 'https', 'git', 'ssh' ]`. You can change this value by adding the following line to your `config/kibana.yaml` file.  In this example, the user only wants to support the `https` protocol:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.code.gitProtocolWhitelist: [ "https" ]
----

==== Clone repo with SSH key
If your repo clone requires an SSH key for authentication, put the SSH key in `data/code/credentials/` under the {kib} folder.
