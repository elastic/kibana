== Semantic code navigation
If the file is one of *Codeâ€™s* <<code-install-lang-server, supported languages>> and the corresponding language server is <<code-install-lang-server, properly installed>>, you can navigate the files with semantic code navigation features.

==== Goto definition and find reference
Hovering your cursor over a symbol in a file opens information about the symbol, including its qualified name and documentation, when available.  You can perform two actions:

* *Goto Definition* navigates to the symbol definition. If the definition is defined in another repo, *Code* can find the definition if the definition repo is also imported.

* *Find Reference* opens a panel that lists all the places where the symbol is referenced in the current repo.

==== View symbol table
From the *Structure* tab, you can open a symbol table that details the structure of the current class. Clicking on a member function or variable jumps to its definition.
