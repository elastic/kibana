The following languages are supported for the current version:

* Built-in language support: `TypeScript`

* Additional language support: `Java`

You can check the status of the language servers and get installation instructions on the *Language Servers* tab.  Make sure the status of the language server is `INSTALLED` or `RUNNING` after you restart the {kib} instance.

=== Ctag language server
*Code* also uses a Ctag language server to generate symbol information and code intelligence when a dedicated language server is not available. The code intelligence information generated by the Ctag language server is less accurate but covers more languages.
