== Config for multiple {kib} instances
If you are using multiple instances of {kib}, you must manually assign at least one {kib} instance as a *Code* `node`. Add the following line of code to your `kibana.yml` file for each {kib} instance you wish to use and restart the instances:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.code.codeNodeUrl: 'http://$YourCodeNodeAddress'
----

`$YourCodeNoteAddress` is the URL of your assigned *Code* node accessible by other {kib} instances.
