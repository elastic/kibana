== Import your first repo

The easiest way to get started with *Code* is to import a real-world repository.

[float]
==== Before you begin
You must have a {kib} instance up and running.

If you are in an environment where you have multiple {kib} instances in a cluster, see the <<code-multiple-kibana-instances-config, config instructions for multiple Kibana instances>>.

[float]
==== Enable Code app
While in beta, you can turn on *Code* by adding the following line to `kibana.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.code.ui.enabled: true
----

[float]
==== Import your first repository
. In {Kib}, navigate to *Code*.

. In the *Repository URL* field, paste the following GitHub clone URL:
+
[source,bash]
----
https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter
----

`https` is recommend for cloning most git repositories. To clone a private repository, <<code-repo-management, use SSH>>. 

. Click *Import*.
+
A new item in the list displays the cloning and indexing progress of the `TypeScript-Node-Starter` repo.

. After the indexing is complete, navigate to the repo by clicking its name in the list.

Congratulations! You just imported your first repo into *Code*.
