*Elastic Maps* enables you to parse through your geographical data at scale, with speed, and in real time. With features like multiple layers and indices in a map, plotting of raw documents, dynamic client-side styling, and global search across multiple layers, you can understand and monitor your data with ease.

With *Elastic Maps*, you can:

* Create maps with multiple layers and indices.
* Upload GeoJSON files into Elasticsearch.
* Embed your map in Dashboards.
* Plot individual documents or use aggregations to plot any data set, no matter how large.
* Create choropleth maps.
* Use data driven styling to symbolize features from property values.
* Focus the data you want to display with searches.

Start your tour of *Elastic Maps* with the <<maps-getting-started, getting started tutorial>>.
