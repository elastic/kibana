Elastic Maps enables you to parse through your geographical data at scale, with speed, and in real time. With features like multiple layers and indices in a map, plotting of raw documents, dynamic client-side styling, and global search across multiple layers, you can understand and monitor your data with ease.

With Elastic Maps, you can:

* Upload GeoJSON files into Elasticsearch.
* Create Maps with multiple layers and indices.
* <<maps-embedding, Embed>> your Map in Dashboards.
* Plot <<maps-add-elasticsearch-layer, individual documents>>.
* Use <<maps-aggregations, aggregations>> to plot any data set, no matter how large.
* Create <<maps-add-choropleth-layer, choropleth maps>>.
* <<vector-style, Customize>> your data by property, such as size, color, symbol, and rotation.
* Use <<maps-vector-style-data-driven, data driven styling>> to symbolize features from property values.
* Focus the data you want to display with <<maps-search, searches>>.
