== Getting started with Maps

You work with *Maps* by adding layers. The data for a layer can come from 
sources such as {es} documents, vector sources, tile map services, web map 
services, and more. You can symbolize the data in different ways. 
For example, you might show which airports have the longest flight 
delays by using circles from small to big. Or, 
you might show the amount of web log traffic by shading countries from 
light to dark.

=== Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial, <<add-sample-data, add the web logs sample data set>>. Each
sample data set includes a map to go along with the data. Once you've added the data, open *Maps* and 
explore the different layers of the *[Logs] Total Requests and Bytes* map.
You'll re-create this map in this tutorial.

=== Take-away skills
In this tutorial, you'll learn to:

* Create a multi-layer map
* Connect a layer to a data source
* Use symbols, colors, and labels to style a layer
* Create layers for {es} data

=== Creating a new map

The first thing to do is to create a new map.

. If you haven't already, open *Maps*. 
. On the maps list page, click *Create map*.
+
A new map is created using a base tile layer.

[[maps-add-choropleth-layer]]
=== Adding a choropleth layer

Now that you have a map, you'll want to add layers to it.
The first layer you'll add is a choropleth layer to shade world countries 
by web log traffic. Darker shades symbolize countries with more web log traffic, 
and lighter shades symbolize countries with less traffic.

==== Add a vector layer from the Elastic Maps Service source

. In the map legend, click *Add layer*.
. Click the *Vector shapes* data source.
. From the *Layer* dropdown menu, select *World Countries*.
. Click the *Add layer* button.
. Set *Layer name* to `Total Requests by Country`.
. Set *Layer transparency* to 0.5.

===== Join the vector layer with the sample web log index

You must add the web log traffic property to the world countries so
that the property is available for styling.
You'll create a <<terms-join, terms join>> to link the vector source *World Countries* to 
the {es} index `kibana_sample_data_logs` on the shared key iso2 = geo.src. 

. Click plus image:maps/images/gs_plus_icon.png[] to the right of *Term Joins* label.
. Click *Join --select--*
. Set *Left field* to *ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code*.
. Set *Right source* to *kibana_sample_data_logs*.
. Set *Right field* to *geo.src*.

===== Set the vector style

The final step is to set the vector fill color to shade 
the countries by web log traffic.

. Click image:maps/images/gs_link_icon.png[] to the right of *Fill color*.
. Select the grey color ramp.
. In the field select input, select *count of kibana_sample_data_logs:geo.src*.
. Click *Save & close*.
+
Your map now looks like this:

[[maps-add-elasticsearch-layer]]
=== Adding layers for {es} data

You'll add two layers for {es} data. The first layer displays documents, and the
second layer displays aggregated data.
The raw documents appear when you zoom in the map to show smaller regions.
The aggregated data 
appears when you zoom out the map to show larger amounts of the globe.

==== Add a vector layer from the document source

This layer displays web log documents as points.
The layer is only visible when you zoom in the map past zoom level 9.

. In the map legend, click *Add layer*.
. Click the *Documents* data source.
. Set *Index pattern* to *kibana_sample_data_logs*.
. Click the *Add layer* button.
. Set *Layer name* to `Actual Requests`.
. Set *Min zoom* to 9 and *Max zoom* to 24.
. Set *Layer transparency* to 1.
. Set *Fill color* to *#2200ff*.
. Click *Save & close*.

==== Add a vector layer from the grid aggregation source

Aggregations group {es} documents into grids. You can calculate metrics 
for each gridded cell. 

You'll create a layer for aggregated data and make it visible only when the map 
is zoomed out past zoom level 9. Darker colors will symbolize grids 
with more web log traffic, and lighter colors will symbolize grids with less 
traffic. Larger circles will symbolize grids with 
more total bytes transferred, and smaller circles will symbolize 
grids with less bytes transferred.

image::maps/images/grid_metrics_both.png[]

===== Add the layer

. In the map legend, click *Add layer*.
. Click the *Grid aggregation* data source.
. Set *Index pattern* to *kibana_sample_data_logs*.
. Click the *Add layer* button.
. Set *Layer name* to `Total Requests and Bytes`.
. Set *Min zoom* to 0 and *Max zoom* to 9.
. Set *Layer transparency* to 1.

===== Configure the aggregation metrics

. Click plus image:maps/images/gs_plus_icon.png[] to the right of *Metrics* label.
. Select *Sum* in the aggregation select.
. Select *bytes* in the field select.

===== Set the vector style

. In *Vector style*, change *Symbol size*:
  .. Set *Min size* to 1.
  .. Set *Max size* to 25.
  .. In the field select, select *sum of bytes*.
. Click *Save & close* button.
+
Your map now looks like this:

[[maps-save]]
=== Saving the map
Now that your map is complete, you'll want to save it so others can use it.

. In the application toolbar, click *Save*.
. Enter `Tutorial web logs map` for the title.
. Click *Confirm Save*.

You're now ready to start creating maps using your own data. You might find
