== Build a map to compare metrics by country or region

If you are new to **Maps**, this tutorial is a good place to start.
It guides you through the common steps for working with your location data.

You will learn to:

- Create a map with multiple layers and data sources
- Use symbols, colors, and labels to style data values
- Embed a map in a dashboard
- Search across panels in your dashboard

When you complete this tutorial, you’ll have a map that looks like this:

=== Prerequisites

- If you don’t already have {kib}, set it up with https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup?baymax=docs-body&elektra=docs[our free trial].
- This tutorial requires the <<get-started, web logs sample data set>>. The sample data includes a [Logs] Total Requests and Bytes map, which you’ll re-create in this tutorial.
- You must have the correct privileges for creating a map.
If you don't have sufficient privileges to create or save maps,
a read-only icon appears in the toolbar. For more information,
refer to <<xpack-security-authorization,Granting access to {kib}>>.

[[maps-create]]
=== Step 1. Create a map

. Open the main menu, and then click *Dashboard*.
. Click **Create dashboard**.
. Set the time range to *Last 7 days*.
. Click the **Create new Maps** icon image:maps/images/app_gis_icon.png[]

[[maps-add-choropleth-layer]]
=== Step 2. Add a choropleth layer

The first layer you'll add is a choropleth layer to shade world countries
by web log traffic. Darker shades will symbolize countries with more web log traffic,
and lighter shades will symbolize countries with less traffic.

. Click **Add layer**, and then click **Choropleth**.

. From the **Layer** dropdown menu, select **World Countries**.

. In **Statistics source**, set:
** **Data view** to **kibana_sample_data_logs**
** **Join field** to **geo.dest**

. Click **Add layer**.

. In **Layer settings**, set:

** **Name** to `Total Requests by Destination`
** **Opacity** to 50%

. Add a Tooltip field:

** **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code** is added by default.
** Click **+ Add** to open field select.
** Select **name** and click *Add*.

. In **Layer style**:

** Set **Fill color: As number** to the grey color ramp.
** Set **Border color** to white.
** Under **Label**, change **By value** to **Fixed**.

. Click **Save & close**.
+
Your map now looks like this:

[[maps-add-elasticsearch-layer]]
=== Step 3. Add layers for the Elasticsearch data

To avoid overwhelming the user with too much data at once, you'll add two layers
for the Elasticsearch data. The first layer will display individual documents
when users zoom in on the map. The second layer will
display aggregated data when users zoom the map out.

[float]
==== Add a layer for individual documents

This layer displays web log documents as points.
The layer is only visible when users zoom in.

. Click **Add layer**, and then click **Documents**.

. Set **Data view** to **kibana_sample_data_logs**.

. Click **Add layer**.

. In **Layer settings**, set:
** **Name** to `Actual Requests`
** **Visibility** to the range [9, 24]
** **Opacity** to 100%

. Add a tooltip field and select **agent**, **bytes**, **clientip**, **host**,
**machine.os**, **request**, **response**, and **timestamp**.

. In **Scaling**, set *Limits results to 10,000.*

. In **Layer style**, set **Fill color** to **#2200FF**.

. Click **Save & close**.
+
Your map will look like this from zoom level 9 to 24:

[float]
==== Add a layer for aggregated data

You'll create a layer for {ref}/search-aggregations.html[aggregated data] and make it visible only when the map
is zoomed out. Darker colors will symbolize grids
with more web log traffic, and lighter colors will symbolize grids with less
traffic. Larger circles will symbolize grids with
more total bytes transferred, and smaller circles will symbolize
grids with less bytes transferred.

. Click **Add layer**, and select **Clusters and grids**.
. Set **Data view** to **kibana_sample_data_logs**.
. Click **Add layer**.
. In **Layer settings**, set:
** **Name** to `Total Requests and Bytes`
** **Visibility** to the range [0, 9]
** **Opacity** to 100%
. In **Metrics**:
** Set **Aggregation** to **Count**.
** Click **Add metric**.
** Set **Aggregation** to **Sum** with **Field** set to **bytes**.
. In **Layer style**, change **Symbol size**:
** Set the field select to *sum bytes*.
** Set the min size to 7 and the max size to 25 px.
. Click **Save & close** button.
+
Your map will look like this between zoom levels 0 and 9:

[[maps-save]]
=== Step 4. Save the map
Now that your map is complete, save it and return to the dashboard.

. In the toolbar, click *Save and return*.

=== Step 5. Explore your data from the dashboard

View your geospatial data alongside a heat map and pie chart, and then filter the data.
When you apply a filter in one panel, it is applied to all panels on the dashboard.

. Click **Add from library** to open a list of panels that you can add to the dashboard.
. Add **[Logs] Unique Visitor Heatmap** and **[Logs] Bytes distribution** to the dashboard.
+

. To filter for documents with unusually high byte values, click and drag in the *Bytes distribution* chart.

. Remove the filter by clicking **x** next to its name in the filter bar.

. Set a filter from the map:

.. Open a tooltip by clicking anywhere in the United States vector.

.. To show only documents where **geo.src** is **US**, click the filter icon in the row for **ISO 3066-1 alpha-2**.
