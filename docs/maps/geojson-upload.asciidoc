== Upload GeoJSON data
*Elastic Maps* makes it easy to import geospatial data into the Elastic Stack.
Using the *GeoJSON Upload* feature, you can drag and drop your point and shape
data files directly into {es}, and then use them as layers
in the map.  You can also use the GeoJSON data in the broader Kibana ecosystem,
for example, in visualizations and Canvas workpads.

=== Why GeoJSON?
GeoJSON is an open-standard file format for storing geospatial vector data.
Although many vector data formats are available in the GIS community,
GeoJSON is the most commonly used and flexible option.

=== Upload a GeoJSON file
Follow these instructions to upload a GeoJSON data file, or try the
<<indexing-geojson-data-tutorial, end-to-end integrated example>>.

. Open *Elastic Maps*, and then click *Add layer*.
. Click *Uploaded GeoJSON*.

. Use the file chooser to select a valid GeoJSON file. The file will load
a preview of the data on the map.
. Use the default *Index type* of {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point] for point data,
or override it and select {ref}/geo-shape.html[geo_shape].
All other shapes will default to a type of `geo_shape`.
. Leave the default *Index name* and *Index pattern* names (the name of the uploaded
file minus its extension). You might need to change the index name if it is invalid.
. Click *Import file*.

Upon completing the indexing process and creating the associated index pattern,
the Elasticsearch responses are shown on the *Layer add panel* and the indexed data
appears on the map. The geospatial data on the map
should be identical to the locally-previewed data, but now it's indexed data from Elasticsearch.

. To continue adding data to the map, click *Add layer*.
. In *Layer settings*, adjust any settings or <<maps-vector-style-properties, properties>> as needed.
. Click *Save & close*.
