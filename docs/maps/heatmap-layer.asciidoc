Heatmap layers can be created from the following source

*Grid aggregation*:: Geospatial data grouped in grids with metrics for each gridded cell.
Set *Show as* to *heatmap*.
The index must contain at least one field mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point].

NOTE: Only count and sum metric aggregations are available with the grid aggregation source and heatmap layers.
Mean/median/min/max are turned off because the heatmap will blend nearby values.
Blending two average-values would make the cluster more prominent, even though it just might literally mean that these nearby areas are average.
