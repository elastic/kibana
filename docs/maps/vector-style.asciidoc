=== Vector styling

You can customize the look of your vector layers by configuring the following styling properties:

*Border color*:: Defines the border color of the vector features.

*Border width*:: Defines the border width of the vector features.

*Fill color*:: Defines the fill color of the vector features.

*Symbol size*:: Defines the symbol size of point features.

==== Static styling

Use static styling to specificy a constant value for a style property.

==== Data driven styling

Use data driven styling to symbolize features from numeric property values.
Click image:maps/images/gs_link_icon.png[] to enable data driven styling for a style property.

NOTE: The image:maps/images/gs_link_icon.png[] button is only available when your vector features contain numeric properties.

The image below shows an example using the Kibana sample data set "Sample web logs".
The *kibana_sample_data_logs* layer uses data driven styling for fill color and symbol size style properties.
See <<add-sample-data, adding sample data>> to install the `kibana_sample_data_logs` index.

The layer sets fill to a color ramp from light green to dark green.
The layer specifies that the `hour_of_day` feature property is used to determine the color of each feature based on where the value fits on a linear scale between the minimum and maximum values.
Light green circles symbolize documents that occur earlier in the day while dark green circles symbolize documents that occur later in the day.

The layer sets symbol size to a range between 1 and 24 pixels.
The layer specifies that the `bytes` feature property is used to determine the symbol size of each feature based on where the value fits on a linear scale between the minimum and maximum values.
Smaller circles symbolize documents with smaller payloads while larger circles symbolize documents with larger payloads.

[[maps-vector-style-classification]]
==== Classification styling

Use multiple layers, <<maps-layer-based-filtering, layer filtering>>, and <<maps-vector-style-static, static styling>> for classification styling.

The image below shows an example using the Kibana sample data set "Sample web logs".
See <<add-sample-data, adding sample data>> to install the `kibana_sample_data_logs` index.

The *Mac OS requests* layer applies the layer filter `machine.os : osx` so the layer only contains Mac OS requests.
The layer then sets the fill color to a static value of green.

The *Window OS requests* layer applies the layer filter `machine.os : win*` so the layer only contains Window OS requests.
The layer then sets the fill color to a static value of red.
