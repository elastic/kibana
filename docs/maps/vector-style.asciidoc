=== Vector styling

When styling a vector layer, you can customize your data by properties such as size and color.
For each property, you can specify whether to use a constant or dynamic value for the style.

[[maps-vector-style-properties]]
==== Style properties

You can configure the following properties:

*Border color*:: Defines the border color of the vector features.

*Border width*:: Defines the border width of the vector features.

*Fill color*:: Defines the fill color of the vector features.

*Symbol size*:: Defines the symbol size of point features.

NOTE: *LineString* and *MultiLineString* geometries do not have fill and do not use fill color property.
Set border color to style line geometries

==== Style types

You can specify a style using static, data driven, or classification styling.

[[maps-vector-style-static]]
===== Static styling

Use static styling to specificy a constant value for a style property.

[float]
[[maps-vector-style-data-driven]]
===== Data driven styling

Use data driven styling to symbolize features based on numeric property values.
To enable data driven styling, click image:maps/images/gs_link_icon.png[] next to the property.

NOTE: The image:maps/images/gs_link_icon.png[] button is only available for vector features that contain numeric properties.

The image below shows an example of data driven styling using the <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample web logs>> data set.
The *kibana_sample_data_logs* layer uses data driven styling for fill color and symbol size style properties:

* The `hour_of_day` property determines the fill color for each feature based on where the value fits on a linear scale.
Light green circles symbolize documents that occur earlier in the day, and dark green circles symbolize documents that occur later in the day.

* The `bytes` property determines the size of each symbol based on where the value fits on a linear scale.
Smaller circles symbolize documents with smaller payloads, and larger circles symbolize documents with larger payloads.

[float]
[[maps-vector-style-classification]]
===== Classification styling

Use multiple layers, <<maps-layer-based-filtering, layer filtering>>, and <<maps-vector-style-static, static styling>> for classification styling.

The image below shows an example of classification styling using the <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample web logs>> data set:

* The *Mac OS requests* layer applies the filter `machine.os : osx` so the layer only contains Mac OS requests.
The fill color is a static value of green.

* The *Window OS requests* layer applies the filter `machine.os : win*` so the layer only contains Window OS requests.
The fill color is a static value of red.
