=== Vector styling

When styling a vector layer, you can customize your data by property, such as size and color.
For each property, you can specify whether to use a constant or dynamic value for the style.

[[maps-vector-style-properties]]
==== Style properties

You can configure the following properties.

*Fill color*:: The fill color of the vector features.
+
NOTE: *LineString* and *MultiLineString* geometries do not have fill and do not use the fill color property.
Set border color to style line geometries.

*Border color*:: The border color of the vector features.

*Border width*:: The border width of the vector features.

*Symbol size*:: The symbol size of point features.

==== Static styling

Use static styling to specificy a constant value for a style property.

The image below shows an example of static styling using the <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample web logs>> data set.
The *kibana_sample_data_logs* layer uses static styling for all properties.

[[maps-vector-style-data-driven]]
==== Data driven styling

Use data driven styling to symbolize features from a range of numeric property values.
To enable data driven styling, click image:maps/images/gs_link_icon.png[] next to the property.

NOTE: The image:maps/images/gs_link_icon.png[] button is only available for vector features that contain numeric properties.

The image below shows an example of data driven styling using the <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample web logs>> data set.
The *kibana_sample_data_logs* layer uses data driven styling for fill color and symbol size style properties.

* The `hour_of_day` property determines the fill color for each feature based on where the value fits on a linear scale.
Light green circles symbolize documents that occur earlier in the day, and dark green circles symbolize documents that occur later in the day.

* The `bytes` property determines the size of each symbol based on where the value fits on a linear scale.
Smaller circles symbolize documents with smaller payloads, and larger circles symbolize documents with larger payloads.

[[maps-vector-style-class]]
==== Class styling

Class styling symbolizes features by class and requires multiple layers.
Use <<maps-layer-based-filtering, layer filtering>> to define the class for each layer, and <<maps-vector-style-static, static styling>> to symbolize each class.

The image below shows an example of class styling using the <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample web logs>> data set.

* The *Mac OS requests* layer applies the filter `machine.os : osx` so the layer only contains Mac OS requests.
The fill color is a static value of green.

* The *Window OS requests* layer applies the filter `machine.os : win*` so the layer only contains Window OS requests.
The fill color is a static value of red.
