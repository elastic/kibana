=== Vector styling

When styling a vector layer, you can customize your data by property, such as size and color.
For each property, you can specify whether to use a constant or data driven value for the style.

==== Static styling

Use static styling to specificy a constant value for a style property.

This image shows an example of static styling using the <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample web logs>> data set.
The *kibana_sample_data_logs* layer uses static styling for all properties.

==== Data driven styling

Use data driven styling to symbolize features by property values.
To enable data driven styling for a style property, change the selected value from *Fixed* or *Solid* to *By value*.

This image shows an example of data driven styling using the <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample web logs>> data set.
The *kibana_sample_data_logs* layer uses data driven styling for fill color and symbol size style properties.

* The `hour_of_day` property determines the fill color for each feature based on where the value fits on a linear scale.
Light green circles symbolize documents that occur earlier in the day, and dark green circles symbolize documents that occur later in the day.

* The `bytes` property determines the size of each symbol based on where the value fits on a linear scale.
Smaller circles symbolize documents with smaller payloads, and larger circles symbolize documents with larger payloads.

[[maps-vector-style-quantitative-data-driven]]
==== Quantitative data driven styling

Quantitative data driven styling symbolizes features from a range of numeric property values.

Property values are fit from the domain range to the style range on a linear scale.
For example, let's symbolize <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample web log>> documents by size.
The sample web logs `bytes` field ranges from 0 to 18,000. This is the domain range.
The smallest feature has a symbol radius of 1, and the largest feature has a symbol radius of 24. This is the style range.
The `bytes` property value for each feature will fit on a linear scale from the range of 0 to 18,000 to the style range of 1 to 24.

To ensure symbols are consistent as you pan, zoom, and filter the map, quantitative data driven styling uses {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-extendedstats-aggregation.html[extended_stats aggregation] to retrieve statistical metadata. Extended_stats is not available for numeric property values from the <<maps-aggregations, metric aggregations>> count, sum, and unique count.

To configure extended_stats,click the gear icon image:maps/images/gear_icon.png[] to configure extended_stats. Set *Sigma* to a smaller value to minimize outliers by moving the range minimum and maximum closer to the average. Clear the *Calculate range from indices* checkbox to turn off the extended_stats aggregation request. The gear icon is not available for numeric property values from the <<maps-aggregations, metric aggregations>> count, sum, and unique count.

NOTE: When extended_stats is not used, symbols might be inconsistent as users pan, zoom, and filter the map. Without extended_stats, the range is calculated with data from the local layer. The range is re-calculated when layer data changes.

When the property value is undefined for a feature:

* *Fill color* and *Border color* are set to transparent and are not visible.
* *Border width* and *Symbol size* are set to the minimum size.
* *Symbol orientation* is set to 0.

When the symbol range minimum and maximum are the same and there is no range:

* *Fill color* and *Border color* are set to last color in the color ramp.
* *Border width* and *Symbol size* are set to the maximum size.

[[maps-vector-style-qualitative-data-driven]]
==== Qualitative data driven styling

Qualitative data driven styling symbolizes non-numeric properties, such as strings and IP addresses, by category.

Qualitative data driven styling is available for the following styling properties:

* *Fill color*
* *Border color*
* *Label color*
* *Label border color*

Qualitative data driven styling uses a {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[terms aggregation] to retrieve the top nine categories for the property. Feature values within the top categories are assigned a unique color. Feature values outside of the top categories are grouped into the *Other* category. A feature is assigned the *Other* category when the property value is undefined.

This image shows an example of quantitative data driven styling using the <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample web logs>> data set.
The `machine.os.keyword` property determines the color of each symbol based on category.

[[maps-vector-style-class]]
==== Class styling

Class styling symbolizes features by class and requires multiple layers.
Use <<maps-layer-based-filtering, layer filtering>> to define the class for each layer, and <<maps-vector-style-static, static styling>> to symbolize each class.

This image shows an example of class styling using the <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample web logs>> data set.

* The *Mac OS requests* layer applies the filter `machine.os : osx` so the layer only contains Mac OS requests.
The fill color is a static value of green.

* The *Window OS requests* layer applies the filter `machine.os : win*` so the layer only contains Window OS requests.
The fill color is a static value of red.
