=== Vector tooltips

Vector tooltips display attributes for features at your mouse's location.

Features from Elasticsearch sources use <<index-patterns, Kibana index pattern>> <<managing-fields, field formatters>> to format values. You can use field formatters to round numbers, provide units, or even display images.

When more than one feature exist at a location,
attributes for the top feature are displayed along with the number of features at that location.

The image below shows a tooltip with multiple features.
The example is from the <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample eCommerce orders>> data set.
There are 3 features at the current location.
The tooltip is displaying attributes for the top feature, the green circle.
Attributes for other two features are not visible on mouse hover.

==== Locking a tooltip at the current location

Click a location on the map to lock the tooltip in place.

With locked tooltips you can:

* Page through features.
* Create a <<maps-phrase-filter, phrase filter>> from a feature attribute value.
* Create a <<maps-spatial-filters, spatial filter>> from a feature's geometry.

The image below shows a locked tooltip with multiple features from multiple layers.
The example is from the <<add-sample-data, Kibana sample eCommerce orders>> data set.
There are 3 features at the current location.
The tooltip is displaying attributes for the second feature, the blue New York State polygon.
Use the pagination controls on the right to cycle through the features at the current location.
Use the select box in the tooltip header to filter features by layer.
