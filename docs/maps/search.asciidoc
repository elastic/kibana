== Searching your data

**Elastic Maps** embeds the search bar for real-time search.
Only layers requesting data from {es} are filtered when you submit a search request.
Layers narrowed by the search context contain the filter icon image:maps/images/filter_icon.png[] next to the layer name in the legend.

You can create a layer that requests data from {es} from the following:

* <<vector-layer>> with:

** Documents source

** Grid aggregation source

** <<terms-join>>

* <<heatmap-layer>> with Grid aggregation source

=== Creating filters from your map

You can create two types of filters by interacting with your map:

* <<maps-spatial-filters, Spatial filters>>
* <<maps-phrase-filter, Phrase filters>>

[float]
[[maps-spatial-filters]]
==== Spatial filters

A spatial filter narrows search results to documents that either intersect with, are within, or do not intersect with the specified geometry.

You can create spatial filters in two ways:

* Click the tool icon image:maps/images/tools_icon.png[], and then draw a polygon or bounding box on the map to define the spatial filter.
* Click *Filter by geometry* in a <<maps-vector-tooltip-locking, locked tooltip>>, and then use the feature's geometry for the spatial filter.

Spatial filters have the following properties:

* *Geometry label* enables you to provide a meaningful name for your spatial filter.
* *Spatial field* specifies the geo_point or geo_shape field used to determine if a document matches the spatial relation with the specified geometry.
* *Spatial relation* determines the {ref}/query-dsl-geo-shape-query.html#_spatial_relations[spatial relation operator] to use at search time. Only available when *Spatial field* is set to geo_shape.

[[maps-phrase-filter]]
==== Phrase filters

A phrase filter narrows search results to documents that contain the specified text.
You can create a phrase filter by clicking the plus icon image:maps/images/gs_plus_icon.png[] in a <<maps-vector-tooltip-locking, locked tooltip>>.

[[maps-layer-based-filtering]]
=== Filtering a single layer

You can apply a search request to individual layers by setting `Filters` in the layer details panel.
Click the *Add filter* button to add a filter to a layer.

NOTE: Layer filters are not applied to *term joins*. You can apply a search request to *term joins* by setting the *where* clause in the join definition.

[[maps-search-across-multiple-indices]]
=== Searching across multiple indices

Your map might contain multiple {es} indices.
This can occur when your map contains two or more layers with {es} sources from different indices.
This can also occur with a single layer with an {es} source and a <<terms-join>>.

Searching across multiple indices might sometimes result in empty layers.
The most common cause for empty layers are searches for a field that exists in one index, but does not exist in other indices.

[float]
[[maps-disable-search-for-layer]]
==== Disable search for layer

You can prevent the search bar from applying search context to a layer by configuring the following:

* In *Filtering*, clear the *Apply global filter to layer data* checkbox to turn off the global search context for the layer source.

* In *Term joins*, clear the *Apply global filter to join* checkbox to turn off the global search context for the <<terms-join, term join>>.

[float]
[[maps-add-index-search]]
==== Use _index in your search

Add {ref}/mapping-index-field.html[_index] to your search to include documents from indices that do not contain a search field.

For example, suppose you have a vector layer showing the `kibana_sample_data_logs` documents
and another vector layer with `kibana_sample_data_flights` documents.
(See <<add-sample-data, adding sample data>>
to install the `kibana_sample_data_logs` and `kibana_sample_data_flights` indices.)

If you query for
--------------------------------------------------
machine.os.keyword : "osx"
--------------------------------------------------
the `kibana_sample_data_flights` layer is empty because the index
`kibana_sample_data_flights` does not contain the field `machine.os.keyword` and no documents match the query.

[role="screenshot"]
image::maps/images/global_search_multiple_indices_query1.png[]

If you instead query for
--------------------------------------------------
machine.os.keyword : "osx" or _index : "kibana_sample_data_flights"
--------------------------------------------------
the `kibana_sample_data_flights` layer includes data.
