== Searching Your Data

The **Maps** application embeds the query bar with autocomplete for real-time ad hoc search.
All layers with {es} sources are updated when you submit a search request.

=== Layer with {es} source

You can create a layer with {es} source from the following:

- <<vector-layer>> with *Documents* source.

- <<vector-layer>> with *Grid aggregation* source.

- <<heatmap-layer>> with *Grid aggregation* source.

- <<vector-layer>> with <<terms-join>>.


[float]
=== Searching across multiple indexes

Your map may contain multiple {es} indexes.
This can occur when your map contains two or more layers with {es} sources from different indexes.
This can also occur with a single layer with an {es} source and a <<terms-join>>.

Searching across multiple indexes can sometimes result in unanticipated empty layers.
The most common cause for empty layers are searches for a field that exist in one index but does not exist in other indexes.
Add {ref}/mapping-index-field.html[_index] to your search to include documents from indexes that do not contain a search field.
