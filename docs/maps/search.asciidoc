== Searching Your Data

The **Maps** application embeds the query bar with autocomplete for real-time ad hoc search.
All layers with {es} sources are updated when you submit a search request.

=== Layer with {es} source

You can create a layer with {es} source from the following:

- <<vector-layer>> with *Documents* source.

- <<vector-layer>> with *Grid aggregation* source.

- <<heatmap-layer>> with *Grid aggregation* source.

- <<vector-layer>> with <<terms-join>>.


[float]
=== Searching across multiple indices

Your map might contain multiple {es} indices.
This might occur when your map contains two or more layers with {es} sources from different indices.
This might also occur with a single layer with an {es} source and a <<terms-join>>.

Searching across multiple indices might sometimes result in empty layers.
The most common cause for empty layers are searches for a field that exists in one index but does not exist in other indices.
Add {ref}/mapping-index-field.html[_index] to your search to include documents from indices that do not contain a search field.
