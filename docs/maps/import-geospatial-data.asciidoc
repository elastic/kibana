== Import geospatial data

To import geospatical data into the Elastic Stack, the data must be indexed as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point] or {ref}/geo-shape.html[geo_shape].
Geospatial data comes in many formats.
Choose an import tool based on the format of your geospatial data.

TIP: When you upload GeoJSON or delimited files in {kib}, there is a file size
limit, which is configurable in <<fileupload-maxfilesize,Advanced Settings>>.

[[import-geospatial-privileges]]
=== Security privileges

The {stack-security-features} provide roles and privileges that control which users can upload files.
You can manage your roles, privileges, and
spaces in **{stack-manage-app}** in {kib}. For more information, see
{ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges],
<<kibana-privileges, {kib} privileges>>, and <<xpack-kibana-role-management, {kib} role management>>.

To upload GeoJSON files in {kib} with *Maps*, you must have:

* The `all` {kib} privilege for *Maps*
* The `all` {kib} privilege for *{ipm-app}*
* The `create` and `create_index` index privileges for destination indices
* To use the index in *Maps*, you must also have the `read` and `view_index_metadata` index privileges for destination indices

To upload delimited files (such as CSV, TSV, or JSON files) on the {kib} home page, you must also have:

* The `all` {kib} privilege for *Discover*
* The `manage_pipeline` or `manage_ingest_pipelines` cluster privilege
* The `manage` index privilege for destination indices

=== Upload delimited files with latitude and longitude columns

On the {kib} home page, you can upload a file and import it into an {es} index with latitude and longitude columns combined into a `geo_point` field.

. Go to the {kib} home page and click *Upload a file*.
. Select a file in one of the supported file formats.
. Click *Import*.
. Select the *Advanced* tab.
. Set *Index name*.
. If a combined `geo_point` field is not created automatically, click *Add combined field*, then click *Add geo point field*.
. Fill out the form and click *Add*.
. Click *Import*.

=== Upload a GeoJSON file

*Upload GeoJSON* indexes GeoJSON features as a `geo_point` or `geo_shape`.

. <<maps-create, Create a new map>>.
. Click *Add layer*.
. Select *Upload GeoJSON*.
. Use the file chooser to select a GeoJSON file.
. Click *Import file*.

=== Upload data with IP addresses

The GeoIP processor adds information about the geographical location of IP addresses.
See {ref}/geoip-processor.html[GeoIP processor] for details.
For private IP addresses, see https://www.elastic.co/blog/enriching-elasticsearch-data-geo-ips-internal-private-ip-addresses[Enriching data with GeoIPs from internal, private IP addresses].

=== Upload data with GDAL

https://www.gdal.org/[GDAL] (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) contains command line tools that can convert geospatial data between 75 different geospatial file formats and index that geospatial data into {es}.
See https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-to-ingest-geospatial-data-into-elasticsearch-with-gdal[Ingest geospatial data into Elasticsearch with GDAL] for details.
