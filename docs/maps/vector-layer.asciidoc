You can create a vector layer from the following sources:

*Custom vector shapes*:: Vector shapes from static files configured in kibana.yml.
See map.regionmap.* in <<settings>> for details.

*Documents*:: Geospatial data from a Kibana index pattern.
The index must contain at least one field mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point] or {ref}/geo-shape.html[geo_shape].

*Grid aggregation*:: Geospatial data grouped in grids with metrics for each gridded cell.
Set *Show as* to *grid rectangles* or *points*.
The index must contain at least one field mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point].

*Vector shapes*:: Vector shapes of administrative boundaries from https://www.elastic.co/elastic-maps-service[Elastic Maps Service].
