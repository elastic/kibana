To add a vector layer to your map, click *Add layer*, then select one of the following:

*Choropleth*:: Shaded areas to compare statistics across boundaries.

*Clusters and grids*:: Geospatial data grouped in grids with metrics for each gridded cell.
The index must contain at least one field mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point] or {ref}/geo-shape.html[geo_shape].

*Documents*:: Points, lines, and polyons from Elasticsearch.
The index must contain at least one field mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point] or {ref}/geo-shape.html[geo_shape].

NOTE: Document results are limited to the `index.max_result_window` index setting, which defaults to 10000.
Use <<maps-aggregations, aggregations>> to plot large data sets.

*EMS Boundaries*:: Administrative boundaries from https://www.elastic.co/elastic-maps-service[Elastic Maps Service].

*Point to point*:: Aggregated data paths between the source and destination.
The index must contain at least 2 fields mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point], source and destination.

*Upload Geojson*:: Index GeoJSON data in Elasticsearch.
