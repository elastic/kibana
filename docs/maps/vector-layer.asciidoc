You can create a vector layer from the following sources:

*Configured GeoJSON*:: Vector data from hosted GeoJSON configured in kibana.yml.
See map.regionmap.* in <<settings>> for details.

*Documents*:: Vector data from a Kibana index pattern.
The index must contain at least one field mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point] or {ref}/geo-shape.html[geo_shape].

NOTE: Document results are limited to the `index.max_result_window` index setting, which defaults to 10000.
Use <<maps-aggregations, aggregations>> to plot large data sets.

*Grid aggregation*:: Geospatial data grouped in grids with metrics for each gridded cell.
Set *Show as* to *grid rectangles* or *points*.
The index must contain at least one field mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point].

*EMS Boundaries*:: Administrative boundaries from https://www.elastic.co/elastic-maps-service[Elastic Maps Service].

*Point to point*:: Aggregated data paths between the source and destination.
The index must contain at least 2 fields mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point], source and destination.
