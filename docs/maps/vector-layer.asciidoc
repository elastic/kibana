To add a vector layer to your map, click *Add layer*, then select one of the following:

*Choropleth*:: Shaded areas to compare statistics across boundaries.

*Clusters and grids*:: Geospatial data grouped in grids with metrics for each gridded cell.
The index must contain at least one field mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point] or {ref}/geo-shape.html[geo_shape].

*Documents*:: Points, lines, and polyons from Elasticsearch.
The index must contain at least one field mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point] or {ref}/geo-shape.html[geo_shape].
+
Results are limited to the `index.max_result_window` index setting, which defaults to 10000.
Select the appropriate *Scaling* option for your use case.
+
* *Limit results to 10000.* The layer displays features from the first `index.max_result_window` documents.
Results exceeding `index.max_result_window` are not displayed.

* *Show top hits per entity.* The layer displays the <<maps-top-hits-aggregation, most relevant documents per entity>>.

* *Show clusters when results exceed 10000.* When results exceed `index.max_result_window`, the layer uses {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-geotilegrid-aggregation.html[GeoTile grid aggregation] to group your documents into clusters and displays metrics for each cluster. When results are less then `index.max_result_window`, the layer displays features from individual documents.

* *Use vector tiles.* Vector tiles partition your map into 6 to 8 tiles.
Each tile request is limited to the `index.max_result_window` index setting.
Tiles exceeding `index.max_result_window` have a visual indicator when there are too many features to display.

*EMS Boundaries*:: Administrative boundaries from https://www.elastic.co/elastic-maps-service[Elastic Maps Service].

*Point to point*:: Aggregated data paths between the source and destination.
The index must contain at least 2 fields mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point], source and destination.

*Upload Geojson*:: Index GeoJSON data in Elasticsearch.
