Use the information in this section to inspect Elasticsearch requests and find solutions to common problems.

=== Inspect Elasticsearch requests

Maps uses the {ref}/search-search.html[{es} search API] to get documents and aggregation results from {es}. To troubleshoot these requests, open the Inspector, which shows the most recent requests for each layer. You can switch between different requests using the *Request* dropdown.

=== Solutions to common problems

[float]
==== Data view not listed when adding layer

* Verify your geospatial data is correctly mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point] or {ref}/geo-shape.html[geo_shape].
  ** Run `GET myIndexName/_field_caps?fields=myGeoFieldName` in <<console-kibana, Console>>, replacing `myIndexName` and `myGeoFieldName` with your index and geospatial field name.
  ** Ensure response specifies `type` as `geo_point` or `geo_shape`.
* Verify your geospatial data is correctly mapped in your <<managing-fields, data view>>.
  ** Open your data view in <<management, Stack Management>>.
  ** Ensure your geospatial field type is `geo_point` or `geo_shape`.
  ** Ensure your geospatial field is searchable and aggregatable.
  ** If your geospatial field type does not match your Elasticsearch mapping, click the *Refresh* button to refresh the field list from Elasticsearch.
* Data views with thousands of fields can exceed the default maximum payload size.
Increase <<settings, `server.maxPayload`>> for large data views.

[float]
==== Features are not displayed

* Use Inspector to view {es} responses. Ensure the response is not empty.
* Ensure geometry uses the correct latitude and longitude ordering.
  ** Geo-points expressed as strings are ordered as `"latitude,longitude"`. Geo-points expressed as arrays are ordered as the reverse: `[longitude, latitude]`.
  ** Geo-shapes expressed as geojson provide coordinates as `[longitude, latitude]`.
* Ensure fill color and border color are distinguishable from map tiles. It's hard to see white features on a white background.

[float]
==== Elastic Maps Service basemaps are not displayed
*Maps* uses tile and vector data from Elastic Maps Service by default. See <<maps-connect-to-ems, Connect to Elastic Maps Service>> for more info.

[float]
==== Custom tiles are not displayed
* When using a custom tile service, ensure your tile server has configured https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)] so tile requests from your {kib} domain have permission to access your tile server domain.
* Ensure custom vector and tile services have the required coordinate system. Vector data must use EPSG:4326 and tiles must use EPSG:3857.
