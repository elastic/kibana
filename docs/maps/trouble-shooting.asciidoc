=== Using inspector to troubleshoot {es} requests

The Maps application uses the {ref}/search-search.html[{es} search API] to get documents and aggregation results from {es}.
Use Inspector to troubleshoot these requests.

Open Inspector by clicking the *Inspect* button.
The most recent requests for each layer is viewable in inspector.
You can switch between different requests by opening the request drop down and clicking the name of the request.

=== Features are not displayed.

* Use Inspector to view {es} responses. Ensure the response is not empty.
* Ensure geometry uses the correct latitude and longitude ordering.
  ** Geo-points expressed as strings are ordered as `"latitude,longitude"`. Geo-points expressed as arrays are ordered as the reverse: `[longitude, latitude]`.
  ** Geo-shapes expressed as geojson provide coordinates as `[longitude, latitude]`.
* Ensure fill color and border color are distinguishable from map tiles. Its hard to see white features on a white background.

=== Tiles are not displayed

* Ensure your tile server has configured https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)] so tile requests from your Kibana domain have permission to access your tile server domain.
* Ensure tiles have the required coordinate system. Vector data must use EPSG:4326 and tiles must use EPSG:3857.
