Use the information in this section to inspect Elasticsearch requests and find solutions to common problems.

=== Inspect Elasticsearch requests

Maps uses the {ref}/search-search.html[{es} search API] to get documents and aggregation results from {es}. To troubleshoot these requests, open the Inspector, which shows the most recent requests for each layer. You can switch between different requests using the *Request* dropdown.

=== Solutions to common problems

[float]
==== Index not listed when adding layer

* Verify your geospatial data is correctly mapped as {ref}/geo-point.html[geo_point] or {ref}/geo-shape.html[geo_shape].
  ** Run `GET myIndexPatternTitle/_field_caps?fields=myGeoFieldName` in <<console-kibana, Console>>, replacing `myIndexPatternTitle` and `myGeoFieldName` with your index pattern title and geospatial field name.
  ** Ensure response specifies `type` as `geo_point` or `geo_shape`.
* Verify your geospatial data is correctly mapped in your <<managing-fields, Kibana index pattern>>.
  ** Open your index pattern in <<management, Stack Management>>.
  ** Ensure your geospatial field type is `geo_point` or `geo_shape`.
  ** Ensure your geospatial field is searchable and aggregatable.
  ** If your geospatial field type does not match your Elasticsearch mapping, click the *Refresh* button to refresh the field list from Elasticsearch.
* Index patterns with thousands of fields can exceed the default maximum payload size.
Increase <<settings, `server.maxPayloadBytes`>> for large index patterns.

==== Features are not displayed

* Use Inspector to view {es} responses. Ensure the response is not empty.
* Ensure geometry uses the correct latitude and longitude ordering.
  ** Geo-points expressed as strings are ordered as `"latitude,longitude"`. Geo-points expressed as arrays are ordered as the reverse: `[longitude, latitude]`.
  ** Geo-shapes expressed as geojson provide coordinates as `[longitude, latitude]`.
* Ensure fill color and border color are distinguishable from map tiles. It's hard to see white features on a white background.

[float]
==== Tiles are not displayed

* Ensure your tile server has configured https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)] so tile requests from your Kibana domain have permission to access your tile server domain.
* Ensure tiles have the required coordinate system. Vector data must use EPSG:4326 and tiles must use EPSG:3857.

==== Coordinate and region map visualizations not available in New Visualization menu

Kibanaâ€™s out-of-the-box settings no longer offers coordinate and region maps as a
choice in the New Visualization menu because you can create these maps in the Maps app.
If you want to create new coordinate and region map visualizations, set `xpack.maps.showMapVisualizationTypes` to `true`.
