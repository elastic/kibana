== Elastic Maps troubleshooting

Use the information in this section to inspect Elasticsearch requests and find solutions to common problems.

=== Inspect Elasticsearch requests

*Elastic Maps* uses the {ref}/search-search.html[{es} search API] to get documents and aggregation results from {es}. To troubleshoot these requests, open the Inspector, which shows the most recent requests for each layer. You can switch between different requests using the *Request* dropdown.

=== Solutions to common problems

[float]
==== Features are not displayed

* Use Inspector to view {es} responses. Ensure the response is not empty.
* Ensure geometry uses the correct latitude and longitude ordering.
  ** Geo-points expressed as strings are ordered as `"latitude,longitude"`. Geo-points expressed as arrays are ordered as the reverse: `[longitude, latitude]`.
  ** Geo-shapes expressed as geojson provide coordinates as `[longitude, latitude]`.
* Ensure fill color and border color are distinguishable from map tiles. It's hard to see white features on a white background.

[float]
==== Tiles are not displayed

* Ensure your tile server has configured https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)] so tile requests from your Kibana domain have permission to access your tile server domain.
* Ensure tiles have the required coordinate system. Vector data must use EPSG:4326 and tiles must use EPSG:3857.

==== Coordinate and region map visualizations not available in New Visualization menu

Kibanaâ€™s out-of-the-box settings no longer offers coordinate and region maps as a choice in the New Visualization menu because you can create these maps in *Elastic Maps*.
If you want to create new coordinate and region map visualizations, set `xpack.maps.showMapVisualizationTypes` to `true`.
