=== Data Table

include::y-axis-aggs.asciidoc[]

The rows of the data table are called _buckets_. You can define buckets to split the table into rows or to split
the table into additional tables.

Each bucket type supports the following aggregations:

*Date Histogram*:: A {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html[_date histogram_] is built from a
numeric field and organized by date. You can specify a time frame for the intervals in seconds, minutes, hours, days,
weeks, months, or years. You can also specify a custom interval frame by selecting *Custom* as the interval and
specifying a number and a time unit in the text field. Custom interval time units are *s* for seconds, *m* for minutes,
*h* for hours, *d* for days, *w* for weeks, and *y* for years. Different units support different levels of precision,
down to one second.
*Histogram*:: A standard {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-histogram-aggregation.html[_histogram_] is built from a
numeric field. Specify an integer interval for this field. Select the *Show empty buckets* checkbox to include empty
intervals in the histogram.
*Range*:: With a {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-range-aggregation.html[_range_] aggregation, you can specify ranges
of values for a numeric field. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints. Click the red *(x)* symbol to remove
a range.
*Date Range*:: A {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-daterange-aggregation.html[_date range_] aggregation reports values
that are within a range of dates that you specify. You can specify the ranges for the dates using
{ref}common-options.html#date-math[_date math_] expressions. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints.
Click the red *(/)* symbol to remove a range.
*IPv4 Range*:: The {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-iprange-aggregation.html[_IPv4 range_] aggregation enables you to
specify ranges of IPv4 addresses. Click *Add Range* to add a set of range endpoints. Click the red *(/)* symbol to
remove a range.
*Terms*:: A {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[_terms_] aggregation enables you to specify the top
or bottom _n_ elements of a  given field to display, ordered by count or a custom metric.
*Filters*:: You can specify a set of {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-filters-aggregation.html[_filters_] for the data.
You can specify a filter as a query string or in JSON format, just as in the Discover search bar. Click *Add Filter* to
add another filter. Click the image:images/labelbutton.png[] *label* button to open the label field, where you can type
in a name to display on the visualization.
*Significant Terms*:: Displays the results of the experimental
{ref}search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html[_significant terms_] aggregation. The value of the
*Size* parameter defines the number of entries this aggregation returns.
*Geohash*:: The {ref}search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.html[_geohash_] aggregation displays points
based on the geohash coordinates.

Once you've specified a bucket type aggregation, you can define sub-buckets to refine the visualization. Click
*+ Add sub-buckets* to define a sub-bucket, then choose *Split Rows* or *Split Table*, then select an
aggregation from the list of types.

You can use the up or down arrows to the right of the aggregation's type to change the aggregation's priority.

Enter a string in the *Custom Label* field to change the display label.

You can click the *Advanced* link to display more customization options for your metrics or bucket aggregation:

*Exclude Pattern*:: Specify a pattern in this field to exclude from the results.
*Include Pattern*:: Specify a pattern in this field to include in the results.
*JSON Input*:: A text field where you can add specific JSON-formatted properties to merge with the aggregation
definition, as in the following example:

[source,shell]
{ "script" : "doc['grade'].value * 1.2" }

NOTE: In Elasticsearch releases 1.4.3 and later, this functionality requires you to enable
{ref}modules-scripting.html[dynamic Groovy scripting].

The availability of these options varies depending on the aggregation you choose.

Select the *Options* tab to change the following aspects of the table:

*Per Page*:: This field controls the pagination of the table. The default value is ten rows per page.

Checkboxes are available to enable and disable the following behaviors:

*Show metrics for every bucket/level*:: Check this box to display the intermediate results for each bucket aggregation.
*Show partial rows*:: Check this box to display a row even when there is no result.

NOTE: Enabling these behaviors may have a substantial effect on performance.
