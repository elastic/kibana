= REST API

[partintro]

Some of the features of Kibana are provided via a REST API, which is ideal for
people that want to create an integration with Kibana or that want to automate
certain aspects of configuring and deploying Kibana.

Each API in this documentation should be clearly marked as either `stable`,
`beta`, or `experimental`. If an API is not marked, it should be considered
`experimental`.

What do these labels mean?

* *Stable* APIs should be safe to use extensively in production. Any breaking
changes to these APIs should only occur in major versions and will be
clearly documented in the breaking changes documentation for that release.
* *Beta* APIs are on track to become stable, permanent features of Kibana.
Caution should be exercised in their use since it is possible we'd have to make
a breaking change to these APIs in a minor version, but we'll avoid this
wherever possible.
* *Experimental* APIs are just that - an experiment. An experimental API might
have breaking changes in any version of Kibana, or it might even be removed
entirely.

NOTE: You cannot access these APIs via the Console in Kibana.
