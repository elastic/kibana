Global filters are ways you can filter your data within the APM UI.
They are available in the Services, Transactions, Errors, Metrics, and Traces views,
and any filter applied will persist as you move between pages.

[[query-bar]]
==== Query bar

The query bar is a powerful data query feature.
Similar to the query bar in {kibana-ref}/discover.html[Discover],
it enables you to pass advanced queries on your data to filter on particular pieces of information that you're interested in.
It comes with a handy autocomplete that helps find the fields and even provides suggestions to the data they include.
You can select the query bar and hit the down arrow on your keyboard to begin seeing recommendations.

See <<query-bar,advanced queries>> for more information and sample queries.
