The APM app integrates with Kibana's {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[alerting and actions] feature.
It provides a set of built-in **actions** and APM specific threshold **alerts** for you to use
and enables central management of all alerts from <<management,Kibana Management>>.

For a walkthrough of the alert flyout panel, including detailed information on each configurable property,
see Kibana's <<defining-alerts,defining alerts>>.

The APM app supports four different types of alerts:

* Transaction duration anomaly:
alerts when the service's transaction duration reaches a certain anomaly score
* Transaction duration threshold:
alerts when the service's transaction duration exceeds a given time limit over a given time frame
* Transaction error rate threshold:
alerts when the service's transaction error rate is above the selected rate over a given time frame
* Error count threshold:
alerts when service exceeds a selected number of errors over a given time frame

Below, we'll walk through the creation of two of these alerts.

[[apm-create-transaction-alert]]
=== Example: create a transaction duration alert

Transaction duration alerts trigger when the duration of a specific transaction type in a service exceeds a defined threshold.
This guide will create an alert for the `opbeans-java` service based on the following criteria:

* Environment: Production
* Transaction type: `transaction.type:request`
* Average request is above `1500ms` for the last 5 minutes
* Check every 10 minutes, and repeat the alert every 30 minutes
* Send the alert via Slack

From the APM app, navigate to the `opbeans-java` service and select
**Alerts** > **Create threshold alert** > **Transaction duration**.

`Transaction duration | opbeans-java` is automatically set as the name of the alert,
and `apm` and `service.name:opbeans-java` are added as tags.
It's fine to change the name of the alert, but do not edit the tags.

Based on the alert criteria, define the following alert details:

* **Check every** - `10 minutes`
* **Notify every** - `30 minutes`
* **TYPE** - `request`
* **WHEN** - `avg`
* **IS ABOVE** - `1500ms`
* **FOR THE LAST** - `5 minutes`

Select an action type.
Multiple action types can be selected, but in this example, we want to post to a Slack channel.
Select **Slack** > **Create a connector**.
Enter a name for the connector,
and paste the webhook URL.
See Slack's webhook documentation if you need to create one.

A default message is provided as a starting point for your alert.
You can use the https://mustache.github.io/[Mustache] template syntax, i.e., `{{variable}}`
to pass additional alert values at the time a condition is detected to an action.
A list of available variables can be accessed by selecting the
**add variable** button image:apm/images/add-variable.png[add variable button].

Select **Save**. The alert has been created and is now active!

[[apm-create-error-alert]]
=== Example: create an error rate alert

Error rate alerts trigger when the number of errors in a service exceeds a defined threshold.
This guide creates an alert for the `opbeans-python` service based on the following criteria:

* Environment: Production
* Error rate is above 25 for the last minute
* Check every 1 minute, and repeat the alert every 10 minutes
* Send the alert via email to the `opbeans-python` team

From the APM app, navigate to the `opbeans-python` service and select
**Alerts** > **Create threshold alert** > **Error rate**.

`Error rate | opbeans-python` is automatically set as the name of the alert,
and `apm` and `service.name:opbeans-python` are added as tags.
It's fine to change the name of the alert, but do not edit the tags.

Based on the alert criteria, define the following alert details:

* **Check every** - `1 minute`
* **Notify every** - `10 minutes`
* **IS ABOVE** - `25 errors`
* **FOR THE LAST** - `1 minute`

Select the **Email** action type and click **Create a connector**.
Fill out the required details: sender, host, port, etc., and click **save**.

A default message is provided as a starting point for your alert.
You can use the https://mustache.github.io/[Mustache] template syntax, i.e., `{{variable}}`
to pass additional alert values at the time a condition is detected to an action.
A list of available variables can be accessed by selecting the
**add variable** button image:apm/images/add-variable.png[add variable button].

Select **Save**. The alert has been created and is now active!

[[apm-alert-manage]]
=== Manage alerts and actions

From the APM app, select **Alerts** > **View active alerts** to be taken to the Kibana alerts and actions management page.
From this page, you can create, edit, disable, mute, and delete alerts, and create, edit, and disable connectors.

NOTE: If you are using an **on-premise** Elastic Stack deployment with security,
communication between Elasticsearch and Kibana must have TLS configured.
