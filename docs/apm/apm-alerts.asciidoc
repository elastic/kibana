=== Alerts and rules

The APM app allows you to define **rules** to detect complex conditions within your APM data
and trigger built-in **actions** when those conditions are met.

The following **rules** are supported:

* Latency anomaly rule:
Alert when latency of a service is abnormal
* Transaction error rate threshold rule:
Alert when the service's transaction error rate is above the defined threshold
* Error count threshold rule:
Alert when the number of errors in a service exceeds a defined threshold

For a complete walkthrough of the **Create rule** flyout panel, including detailed information on each configurable property,
see Kibana's <<create-edit-rules,create and edit rules>>.

Below, we'll walk through the creation of two APM rules.

[[apm-create-transaction-alert]]
=== Example: create a latency anomaly rule

Latency anomaly rules trigger when the latency of a service is abnormal.
This guide will create an alert for all services based on the following criteria:

* Environment: production
* Severity level: critical
* Run every five minutes
* Send an alert to a Slack channel only when the rule status changes

From any page in the APM app, select **Alerts and rules** > **Latency** > **Create anomaly rule**.
Change the name of the alert, but do not edit the tags.

Based on the criteria above, define the following rule details:

* **Check every** - `5 minutes`
* **Notify** - "Only on status change"
* **Environment** - `all`
* **Has anomaly with severity** - `critical`

Next, add a connector. Multiple connectors can be selected, but in this example we're interested in Slack.
Select **Slack** > **Create a connector**.
Enter a name for the connector,
and paste your Slack webhook URL.
See Slack's webhook documentation if you need to create one.

A default message is provided as a starting point for your alert.
You can use the https://mustache.github.io/[Mustache] template syntax, i.e., `{{variable}}`
to pass additional alert values at the time a condition is detected to an action.
A list of available variables can be accessed by selecting the
**add variable** button image:apm/images/add-variable.png[add variable button].

Click **Save**. The rule has been created and is now active!

[[apm-create-error-alert]]
=== Example: create an error count threshold alert

The error count threshold alert triggers when the number of errors in a service exceeds a defined threshold.
This guide will create an alert for all services based on the following criteria:

* All environments
* Error rate is above 25 for the last minute
* Check every 1 minute, and alert every time the rule is active
* Send the alert via email to the site reliability team

From any page in the APM app, select **Alerts and rules** > **Error count** > **Create threshold rule**.
Change the name of the alert, but do not edit the tags.

Based on the criteria above, define the following rule details:

* **Check every** - `1 minute`
* **Notify** - "Every time alert is active"
* **Environment** - `all`
* **Is above** - `25 errors`
* **For the last** - `1 minute`

Select the **Email** connector and click **Create a connector**.
Fill out the required details: sender, host, port, etc., and click **save**.

[[apm-alert-manage]]
=== Manage alerts and rules

From the APM app, select **Alerts and rules** > **Manage rules** to be taken to the Kibana **Rules and Connectors** page.
From this page, you can disable, mute, and delete APM alerts.

=== More information

See {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting] for more information.

NOTE: If you are using an **on-premise** Elastic Stack deployment with security,
communication between Elasticsearch and Kibana must have TLS configured.
More information is in the alerting {kibana-ref}/alerting-setup.html#alerting-prerequisites[prerequisites].
