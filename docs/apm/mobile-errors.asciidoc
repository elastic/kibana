=== Mobile errors and crashes

TIP: {apm-guide-ref}/data-model-errors.html[Errors] are groups of exceptions with a similar exception or log message.

The *Errors & Crashes* overview provides a high-level view of errors and crashes that APM mobile agents catch,
or that users manually report with APM agent APIs. Errors and crashes are separated into two tabs for easy differentiation.
Like errors are grouped together to make it easy to quickly see which errors are affecting your services,
and to take actions to rectify them.

Selecting an error group ID or error message brings you to the *Error group*.

The error group details page visualizes the number of error occurrences over time and compared to a recent time range.
This allows you to quickly determine if the error rate is changing or remaining constant.
You'll also see the "most affected" chart which can be oriented to 'by device' or 'by app version'.

Further down, you'll see an Error sample.
The error shown is always the most recent to occur.
The sample includes the exception message, culprit, stack trace where the error occurred (when available),
and additional contextual information to help debug the issue--all of which can be copied with the click of a button.

In some cases, you might also see a Transaction sample ID.
This feature allows you to make a connection between the errors and transactions,
by linking you to the specific transaction where the error occurred.
This allows you to see the whole trace, including which services the request went through.
