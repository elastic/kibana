=== Service maps

beta::[]

A service map is a real-time diagram of the interactions occurring in your applicationâ€™s architecture.
It allows you to easily visualize data flow, and high-level statistics, like average transaction duration,
requests per minute, errors per minute, and metrics, allow you to quickly assess the status of services.

Our beta offering creates two types of service maps:

* Global: All services and connections are shown.
* Localized: Selecting a specific service will highlight it's connections.

=== Visualize your architecture

Select the **Service Map** tab to get started.
By default, all services and connections are shown.
Whether your onboarding a new engineer, or just trying to grasp the big picture,
click around, zoom in and out, and begin to visualize how your services are connected.

If there's a specific service that interests you, select that service to highlight its connections.
Clicking **Focus map** will refocus the map on that specific service and lock the connection highlighting.
From here, select **Service Details**, or click on the **Transaction** tab to jump to the Transaction overview.
You can also use the tabs at the top of the page to easily jump to the **Errors** or **Metrics** overview.

While it's not possible to query in service maps, it is possible to filter by environment.
This can be useful if you have two or more services, in separate environments, but with the same name.
Use the environment drop down to only see the data you're interested in, like `dev` or `production`.
