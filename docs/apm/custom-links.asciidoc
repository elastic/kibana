Elastic's custom link feature allows you to easily create up to 500 dynamic links
based on your specific APM data.
Custom links can be filtered to only appear in the APM app for relevant services,
environments, transaction types, or transaction names.

[[custom-links-create]]
=== Create a link

Each custom link consists of a label, URL, and optional filter.
The easiest way to create a custom link is from within the actions dropdown in the transaction detail page.
This method will automatically apply filters, scoping the link to that specific service,
environment, transaction type, and transaction name.

Alternatively, you can create a custom link in the APM app by navigating to **Settings** > **Customize UI**,
and selecting **Create custom link**.

[float]
[[custom-links-label]]
==== Label

The name of your custom link.
The actions context menu displays this text, so keep it as short as possible.

TIP: Custom links are displayed alphabetically in the actions menu.

[float]
[[custom-links-url]]
==== URL

The URL your link points to.
URLs support dynamic field name variables, encapsulated in double curly brackets: `{{field.name}}`.
These variables will be replaced with transaction metadata when the link is clicked.

Because everyone's data is different,
you'll need to examine your traces to see what metadata is available for use.
To do this, select a trace in the APM app, and click **Metadata** in the **Trace Sample** table.

[[custom-links-filters]]
==== Filters

Filter each link to only appear for specific services or transactions.
You can filter on the following fields:

* `service.name`
* `service.env`
* `transaction.type`
* `transaction.name`

Multiple values are allowed when comma-separated.
