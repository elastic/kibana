You can use the power of the alerting features with Watcher to get reports on error occurrences.
The Watcher assistant, which is available on the errors overview, can help you set up a watch per service.

Configure the watch with an occurrences threshold, time interval, and the desired actions, such as email or Slack notifications.
With Watcher, your team can set up reports within minutes.

Watches are managed separately in the dedicated Watcher UI available in Advanced Settings.
