=== Track deployments with annotations

++++
<titleabbrev>Track deployments</titleabbrev>

For enhanced visibility into your deployments, we offer deployment annotations on all transaction charts.
This feature automatically tags new deployments, so you can easily see if your deploy has increased response times
for an end-user, or if the memory/CPU footprint of your application has changed.
Being able to identify bad deployments quickly enables you to rollback and fix issues without causing costly outages.

Deployment annotations are automatically enabled, and appear when the `service.version` of your app changes.
