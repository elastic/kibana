=== Track deployments with annotations

++++
<titleabbrev>Track deployments with annotations</titleabbrev>

For enhanced visibility into your deployments, we offer deployment annotations on all transaction charts.
This feature automatically tags new deployments, so you can easily see if your deploy has increased response times
for an end-user, or if the memory/CPU footprint of your application has changed.
Being able to identify bad deployments quickly enables you to rollback and fix issues without causing costly outages.

Deployment annotations are enabled by default, and can be created with the <<apm-annotation-api,annotation API>>.
If there are no created annotations for the selected time period,
the APM app will automatically annotate your data if the `service.version` of your application changes.

NOTE: If custom annotations have been created for the selected time period, any derived annotations, i.e., those created automatically when `service.version` changes, will not be shown.
