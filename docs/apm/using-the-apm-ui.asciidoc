== Using the APM UI

We’ve designed the UI to be as intuitive as possible, but you might come across certain terms or concepts in the APM UI that don’t feel native to you. Not to worry, that’s why we’ve created this guide to help you get the most out of the solution.

[[services]]
=== Services

Services are added by setting the `service.name` in the APM agent configuration per service you’re instrumenting. The global time range filter in Kibana defines which services are available in view. The overview gives you a quick insight into the health and general performance of each service.

[[transactions]]
=== Transactions

The APM agents will automatically collect performance metrics on HTTP requests, database queries and much more. Please refer to the documentation for each agent we have available for more detail. We’re displaying each `transaction.type` separately in order to not get them all mixed together and make it easy for you to navigate to a single transaction.

[[spans]]
=== Spans

A span is defined as the duration of a single event. Spans are also automatically captured by the APM agents, but you can also define your own custom ones. Each span has a type, and that’s also defining a different colour in the Timeline visualization (also known as the waterfall). Each span can be viewed in detail by clicking a single span in the Timeline. This typically displays the recorded SQL database query or source code (in-app frames) around the single event that was captured.

[[errors]]
=== Errors

Errors are defined as groups of exceptions with matching exception or log messages. Each error group will feature a rich breakdown of the exception including the stackframes from when the error occurred, and additional contextual information collected to help debug the issue.

[[errors-watcher]]

=== Alerts with Watcher

It’s possible to utilize the power of the alerting features with Watcher to get alerts on error occurrences. We’ve created an assistant, which is available on the Errors overview page, to help you set up a watch per service.

Configure the watch with occurrences threshold and time interval and set the desired actions like email or Slack notifications and your team can be set up with alerts in minutes.

Watches are managed separately in the dedicated Watcher UI available in Advanced Settings.
