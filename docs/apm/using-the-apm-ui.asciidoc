== Using the APM UI

The APM UI is designed to be as intuitive as possible, but you might come across certain terms or concepts that don’t feel native to you. Not to worry, we've created this guide to help you get the most out of Elastic APM.

[[services]]
=== Services

The Services overview gives you a quick insight into the health and general performance of each service.
The <<set-time-filter,global time range filter>> in {kib} defines which services are available.

You can add services by setting the `service.name` configuration in each of the [APM agents] you’re instrumenting.

[[transactions]]
=== Transactions

Selecting a service on the Services overview page will bring you to the Transaction overview page. 
A [`transaction`] describes an event captured by an Elastic APM agent instrumenting a service.
The APM agents automatically collect performance metrics on HTTP requests, database queries, and much more.

On this page, each `transaction.type` is displayed separately to make it easy for you to navigate to any transaction.
By default, transactions are sorted by _Impact_. Impact helps show the most used and slowest endpoints in your service.

NOTE: For more details on transactions and , refer to the documentation for each [APM Agent] you're instrumenting.

[NOTE]
====
You might see some transactions named "unknown route". This indicates that the agent detected an incoming HTTP request to your application, but didn’t know which route in your service the HTTP request matched.

This could simply be a 404 request, which by definition don’t match any route, or it might be a symptom that the agent either wasn’t installed correctly, or doesn't support your framework. For more details and other troubleshooting, refer to the documentation for each APM Agent you're instrumenting.

[[spans]]
=== Spans

A span is defined as the duration of a single event. Spans are automatically captured by the APM agents, but you can also define custom spans. Each span has a type and is defined by a different colour in the Timeline visualization (also known as the waterfall).

You can view a span in detail by clicking it in the Timeline. This displays the recorded SQL database query or source code (in-app frames) around the event that was captured.

[[errors]]
=== Errors

Errors are defined as groups of exceptions with matching exception or log messages. Each error group features a breakdown of the exception including the stackframes from when the error occurred and additional contextual information to help debug the issue.

[[errors-alerts-with-watcher]]
=== Errors alerts with Watcher

You can use the power of the alerting features with Watcher to get alerts on error occurrences. The Watcher assistant, which is available on the Errors overview page, can help you set up a watch per service.

Configure the watch with occurrences threshold and time interval and set the desired actions, such as email or Slack notifications. Your team can be set up with alerts in minutes.

Watches are managed separately in the dedicated Watcher UI available in Advanced Settings.

[[machine-learning-integration]]
=== Machine Learning integration

The Machine Learning integration will initiate a new job predefined to calculate anomaly scores on transaction response times. The response time graph will show the expected bounds and annotate the graph when the anomaly score is 75 or above.

Jobs can be created per transaction type and based on the average response time. You can manage jobs in the Machine Learning jobs management page. It might take some time for results to appear on the graph.

[[query-bar]]
=== Query bar

The query bar is a powerful data query feature. Similar to the query bar in {kibana-ref}/discover.html[Discover] it enables you to pass advanced queries on your data to filter on particular pieces of information that you're interested in. It comes with a handy autocomplete that helps find the fields and even provides suggestions to the data they include. The query bar is available on Services, Transaction and Errors views, and any input will persist as you move between them.

==== Example queries

* Exclude response times faster than 2000 ms; `transaction.duration.us > 2000000`
* Filter by response status code; `context.response.status_code >= 400`
* Filter by single user ID; `context.user.id : 12`
