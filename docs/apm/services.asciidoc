=== Services overview

The *Services* overview gives you quick insights into the health and general performance of each service.
The <<set-time-filter,global time range filter>> in {kib} defines which services are available.

You can add services by setting the `service.name` configuration in each of the {apm-agents-ref}[APM agents] youâ€™re instrumenting.
