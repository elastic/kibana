=== Services

*Service* inventory provides a quick, high-level overview of the health and general
performance of all instrumented services.

To help surface potential issues, services are sorted by their health status:
**critical** > **warning** > **healthy** > **unknown**.
Health status is powered by <<machine-learning-integration,machine learning>>
and requires anomaly detection to be enabled.
