=== APM Agent configuration

APM Agent configuration allows you to fine-tune your agent configuration directly in Kibana.
Best of all, changes are automatically propagated to your APM agents so there's no need to redeploy.

To get started, simply choose the services and environments you wish to configure.
The APM app will let you know when your configurations have been applied by your agents.

==== Precedence

Configurations set with APM Agent configuration take precedence over configurations set locally in the Agent.
However, if APM Server is slow to respond, is offline, reports an error, etc.,
APM agents will use local defaults until they're able to update the configuration.
For this reason, it is still important to set custom default configurations locally in each of your agents.

==== APM Server setup

This feature requires {apm-server-ref}/setup-kibana-endpoint.html[Kibana endpoint configuration] in APM Server.

Why is additional configuration needed in APM Server?
That's because APM Server acts as a proxy between the agents and Kibana.
Kibana communicates any changed settings to APM Server so that your agents only need to poll APM Server to determine which settings have changed.

==== Supported configurations

Each Agent has its own list of supported configurations.
After selecting a Service name and environment in the APM app,
a list of all available configuration options,
including descriptions and default values, will be displayed.

Supported configurations are also marked in each Agent's configuration documentation:
