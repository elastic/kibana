APM Agent configuration allows you to fine-tune your agent configuration from within the APM app.
Changes are automatically propagated to your APM agents, so there's no need to redeploy.

To get started, choose the services and environments you wish to configure.
The APM app will let you know when your agents have applied your configurations.

==== Precedence

Configurations set from the APM app take precedence over configurations set locally in each Agent.
However, if APM Server is slow to respond, is offline, reports an error, etc.,
APM agents will use local defaults until they're able to update the configuration.
For this reason, it is still essential to set custom default configurations locally in each of your agents.

==== APM Server setup

This feature requires {apm-server-ref}/setup-kibana-endpoint.html[Kibana endpoint configuration] in APM Server.

APM Server acts as a proxy between the agents and Kibana.
Kibana communicates any changed settings to APM Server so that your agents only need to poll APM Server to determine which settings have changed.

==== Supported configurations

Each Agent has a list of supported configurations.
After selecting a Service name and environment in the APM app,
a list of all supported configuration options,
including descriptions and default values, will be displayed.

Supported configurations are also tagged with the image:./images/dynamic-config.svg[] badge in each Agent's configuration reference:
