=== APM Agent configuration

beta[] APM Agent configuration allows you to fine-tune your agent configuration directly in Kibana.
Best of all, changes are automatically propagated to your APM agents so there's no need to redeploy.

To get started, simply choose the service and environment you wish to configure.

IMPORTANT: As this feature is in Beta, a limited number of configuration settings are supported.
We recommend you watch your agent logs to confirm that configuration has been applied.
If you have feedback, please reach out in our https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm[Discuss forum].

==== Precedence

Configurations set with APM Agent configuration take precedence over configurations set locally in the Agent.
However, if APM Server is slow to respond, is offline, reports an error, etc.,
APM agents will use local defaults until they're able to update the configuration.
For this reason, it is still important to set custom default configurations locally in each of your agents.

==== APM Server setup

This feature requires {apm-server-ref}/setup-kibana-endpoint.html[Kibana endpoint configuration] in APM Server.

Why is additional configuration needed in APM Server?
That's because APM Server acts as a proxy between the agents and Kibana.
Kibana communicates any changed settings to APM Server so that your agents only need to poll APM Server to determine which settings have changed.

===== `TRANSACTION_SAMPLE_RATE`

added[7.3.0] A sample rate between `0.000` and `1.0`. Default configuration is `1.0` (100% of traces).

Adjusting the sampling rate controls what percent of requests are traced.
`1.0` means _all_ requests are traced. If you set the `TRANSACTION_SAMPLE_RATE` to a value below `1.0`,
the agent will randomly sample only a subset of transactions.
Unsampled transactions only record the name of the transaction, the overall transaction time, and the result.
