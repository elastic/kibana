== Getting Started

If you have not already installed and configured Elastic APM, the
**APM > Getting Started** page in {kib} provides information to help you
complete the setup.

After you install the Elastic APM agent library in your application, the
application automatically appears in the APM UI in {kib}. No further
configuration is required.

If you also use Elastic Stack for logging and server-level metrics, you can
optionally import the APM dashboards that come with the APM Server. You can use
these APM-specific visualizations to correlate APM data with other data sources.
To get the dashboards, click the "Load Kibana objects" button at the bottom of the Getting Started guides for APM in Kibana.

For more setup information, see
{apm-get-started-ref}/index.html[Getting Started with APM].
