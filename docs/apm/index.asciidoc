Elastic Application Performance Monitoring (APM) automatically collects in-depth
performance metrics and errors from inside your applications.

The APM app in {kib} is provided with the basic license.
It allows you to monitor your software services and applications in real time â€” visualize
detailed performance information on your services,
identify and analyzing errors,
and monitor host-level and agent-specific metrics like JVM and Go runtime metrics.
