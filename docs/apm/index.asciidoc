Elastic Application Performance Monitoring (APM) automatically collects in-depth
performance metrics and errors from inside your applications.

The **APM** app in {kib} is provided with the basic license. It
enables developers to drill down into the performance data for their applications
and quickly locate the performance bottlenecks.
