=== Find latency and error correlations

Correlations surface attributes of your data that are potentially correlated
with high-latency or erroneous transactions. For example, a site reliability
engineer, who is responsible for keeping production systems up and running,
notices an increase in latency in certain transactions. Analyzing attributes
that exist in high-latency transactions but not in lower-latency transactions
can potentially point towards the root cause. They may find that a particular
piece of hardware, like a host or pod, has failed, increasing latency. Or,
perhaps a set of users, based on IP address or region, is facing increased
latency due to local data center issues.

To view correlations in the {apm-app}, select a service on *Services* page and
click **View correlations**.

NOTE: Queries within the {apm-app} are also applied to the correlations.

==== Find high-latency correlations

The correlations on the *Latency* tab help you discover which attributes are
contributing to increased service latency.

A latency distribution chart visualizes the overall latency of the service. If
there are attributes that have a statistically significant impact on the
latency, they are listed in a table below the chart. The table is sorted by
correlation values, which are Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) that range
from 0 to 1. Attributes with higher correlation values are more likely to
contribute to high latency transactions. By default, the attribute
with the highest correlation value is added to the chart.

To find high-latency correlations, hover over each potentially correlated
attribute to compare the latency distribution of transactions with and without
the selected attribute.
//TBD: Talk about interpreting the skew of attributes in chart?

If a correlated attribute seems noteworthy, use the **Filter** quick links:

* `+` creates a new query in the APM app for filtering transactions containing
the selected value.
* `-` creates a new query in the APM app to filter out transactions containing
the selected value.

In this example screenshot, the field `labels.orderPriceRange` and value `large`
exists primarily in higher-latency transactions between 0.1 and 4.0 seconds.
Select the `+` filter in the first row of the table to create a new query in the
APM app for transactions with this attribute. With the "noise" now filtered out,
you can begin viewing sample traces to continue your investigation.

[[correlations-error-rate]]
==== Find error rate correlations

The correlations on the *Error rate* tab help you discover which fields are
contributing to failed transactions.

By default, a number of attributes commonly known to cause performance issues,
like version, infrastructure, and location, are included, but all are completely
customizable to your APM data. Find something interesting? A quick click of a 
button will auto-query your data as you work to resolve the underlying issue.

The error rate over time chart visualizes the change in error rate over the selected time frame.
Correlated attributes are sorted by _Impact_–a visual representation of the
{ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html[significant terms aggregation]
score that powers correlations.
Attributes with a high impact, or attributes present in a large percentage of failed transactions,
may contribute to increased error rates.

To find error rate correlations, hover over each potentially correlated attribute to
compare the error rate distribution of transactions with and without the selected attribute.

For example, in the screenshot below, the field `url.original` and value `http://localhost:3100...`
existed in 100% of failed transactions between 6:00 and 10:30.

Select the `+` filter to create a new query in the APM app for transactions with
`url.original: http://localhost:3100...`. With the "noise" now filtered out,
you can begin viewing sample traces to continue your investigation.

As you sift through erroneous transactions, you'll likely notice other interesting attributes.
Return to the correlations fly-out and select *Customize fields* to search on these new attributes.
You may need to do this a few times–each time filtering out more and more noise and bringing you
closer to a diagnosis.

[[correlations-customize-fields]]
=====  Customize fields

Correlations are only as good as the data they're searching for.
By default, a handful of attributes commonly known to cause performance issues are included.
During the course of an investigation however, you may need to add and remove fields from
this list multiple times as you narrow in on a diagnosis.

Add and remove fields under the **Customize fields** dropdown.
The following fields are selected by default.
To keep the default list manageable, only the first six matching fields with wildcards are used.

**Frontend (RUM) agent:**

* `labels.*`
* `user.*`
* `user_agent.name`
* `user_agent.os.name`
* `url.original`

**Backend agents:**

* `labels.*`
* `host.ip`
* `service.node.name`
* `service.version`

TIP: Want to start over? Select **reset** to clear your customizations.
