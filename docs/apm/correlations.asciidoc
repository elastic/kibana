=== Find latency and error correlations

**Correlations** surfaces attributes of your data that are potentially correlated with high-latency or erroneous transactions.
Surfaced attributes are user-defined, meaning that they are completely customizable to your APM data.
Find something interesting? A quick click of a button will auto-query your data as you work to resolve the underlying issue.

For example, a site reliability engineer, who is responsible for keeping production systems up and running,
notices an increase in latency in certain transactions.
Analyzing metadata or tags that exist in high-latency transactions but not in lower-latency transactions
can potentially point towards the root cause.
They may find that a particular piece of hardware, like a host or pod, has failed, increasing latency.
Or, perhaps a set of users, based on IP address or region, is physically too far away from the nearest
data center, increasing latency.

[[correlations-latency]]
====  Latency

Correlations help you discover which fields are contributing to increased service latency.

A latency distribution chart visualizes the overall latency of the selected service's transactions.
Correlated attributes are sorted by _Impact_–a visual representation of the score for the underlying
aggregation that powers correlations.
Attributes with a high impact, or attributes present in a large percentage of slow transactions,
may be contributing factors to increased latency.

If a certain field or value seems noteworthy, use the **Filter** quick links:

* `+` creates a new query in the APM app for transactions containing the selected value.
* `-` creates a new query in the APM app for transactions without the selected value.

[[correlations-error-rate]]
====  Error rate

Correlations help you discover which fields are contributing to failed transactions.

The Error rate over time chart visualizes the change in error rate over the selected time frame.
Correlated attributes are sorted by _Impact_–a visual representation of the score for the underlying
aggregation that powers correlations.
Attributes with a high impact, or attributes present in a large percentage of failed transactions,
may be contributing factors to increased error rates.

If a certain field or value seems noteworthy, use the **Filter** quick links:

* `+` creates a new query in the APM app for transactions containing the selected value.
* `-` creates a new query in the APM app for transactions without the selected value.

[[correlations-custom-fields]]
====  Customize fields

Correlations are only as good as the data they're searching for.
By default, a handful of potentially useful fields are selected, like `lables`, `service.version`, and `host.ip`.
You can remove and add fields to this list under the **Customize fields** dropdown.
