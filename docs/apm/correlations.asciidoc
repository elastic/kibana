[[correlations]]
=== Find latency and error correlations

**Correlations** surface attributes of your data that are potentially correlated with high-latency or erroneous transactions.
Find something interesting? A quick click of a button will auto-query your data as you work to resolve the underlying issue.

For example, a site reliability engineer, who is responsible for keeping production systems up and running,
notices an increase in latency in certain transactions.
Analyzing metadata or tags that exist in high-latency transactions but not in lower-latency transactions
can potentially point towards the root cause.
They may find that a particular piece of hardware, like a host or pod, has failed, increasing latency.
Or, perhaps set of users, based on IP address or region, is facing increased latency due to local data center issues.

Queries within the APM app apply to the correlations shown in the correlations fly-out.

If a correlated field seems noteworthy, use the **Filter** quick links:

* `+` creates a new query in the APM app for filtering transactions containing the selected value.
* `-` creates a new query in the APM app to filter out transactions containing the selected value.

[[correlations-latency]]
==== Find high-latency correlations

Correlations help you discover which transaction attributes are contributing to increased service latency.

A latency distribution chart visualizes the overall latency of the selected service's transactions.
Correlated attributes are sorted by a _Correlation_ score ranging from 0 to 1 – the greater the score, the more the attribute value is a commonality of slow transactions.
Field values with a high score may contribute to increased latency.

To find high-latency correlations, hover over each potentially correlated attribute to
compare the latency distribution of transactions with and without the selected attribute.

For example, in the screenshot below of the "createOrder" transaction of an ecommerce site, the attribute `labels.orderPriceRange` with value `large`
exists primarily in higher-latency transactions exceeding 900ms. This insight suggests that only orders of expensive shopping carts are impacted by high latency.

Select the `+` filter to create a new query in the APM app for transactions with
`labels.orderPriceRange: large`. With the "noise" now filtered out,
you can begin viewing sample traces to continue your investigation.

As you sift through high-latency transactions, you'll likely notice other interesting attributes.
Return to the correlations fly-out to search on these new attributes.
You may need to do this a few times–each time filtering out more and more noise and bringing you
closer to a diagnosis.
On the example screenshot above of the "createOrder" transaction of an eCommerce website, the
payment method mays also be a crontributing factor as the attribute value
`labels.paymentMethod: AMEX` also has a noticeable correlation score of 0.34.

[[correlations-error-rate]]
==== Find error rate correlations

Correlations help you discover which fields are contributing to failed transactions.

The Error rate over time chart visualizes the change in error rate over the selected time frame.
Correlated attributes are sorted by _Impact_–a visual representation of the
{ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html[significant terms aggregation]
score that powers correlations.
Attributes with a high impact, or attributes present in a large percentage of failed transactions,
may contribute to increased error rates.

To find error rate correlations, hover over each potentially correlated attribute to
compare the error rate distribution of transactions with and without the selected attribute.

For example, in the screenshot below, the field `url.original` and value `http://localhost:3100...`
existed in 100% of failed transactions between 6:00 and 10:30.

Select the `+` filter to create a new query in the APM app for transactions with
`url.original: http://localhost:3100...`. With the "noise" now filtered out,
you can begin viewing sample traces to continue your investigation.

As you sift through erroneous transactions, you'll likely notice other interesting attributes.
Return to the correlations fly-out and select *Customize fields* to search on these new attributes.
You may need to do this a few times–each time filtering out more and more noise and bringing you
closer to a diagnosis.

[[correlations-customize-fields]]
====  Customize fields used for error rate correlations

Correlations are only as good as the data they're searching for.
By default, a handful of attributes commonly known to cause performance issues are included in error rate correlations analysis.
During the course of an investigation however, you may to need to add and remove fields from
this list multiple times as you narrow in on a diagnosis.

Add and remove fields under the **Customize fields** dropdown.
The following fields are selected by default.
To keep the default list manageable, only the first six matching fields with wildcards are used.

**Frontend (RUM) agent:**

* `labels.*`
* `user.*`
* `user_agent.name`
* `user_agent.os.name`
* `url.original`

**Backend agents:**

* `labels.*`
* `host.ip`
* `service.node.name`
* `service.version`

TIP: Want to start over? Select **reset** to clear your customizations.
