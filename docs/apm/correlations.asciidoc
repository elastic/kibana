=== Find transaction latency and failure correlations

Correlations surface attributes of your data that are potentially correlated
with high-latency or erroneous transactions. For example, if you are a site
reliability engineer who is responsible for keeping production systems up and
running, you want to understand what is causing slow transactions. Identifying
attributes that are responsible for higher latency transactions can potentially
point you toward the root cause. You may find a correlation with a particular
piece of hardware, like a host or pod. Or, perhaps a set of users, based on IP
address or region, is facing increased latency due to local data center issues.

To find correlations, select a service on the *Services* page in the {apm-app}
then select a transaction group from the *Transactions* tab.

NOTE: Queries within the {apm-app} are also applied to the correlations.

==== Find high transaction latency correlations

The correlations on the *Latency correlations* tab help you discover which
attributes are contributing to increased transaction latency.

The progress bar indicates the status of the asynchronous analysis, which
performs statistical searches across a large number of attributes. For large
time ranges and services with high transaction throughput, this might take some
time. To improve performance, reduce the time range.

The latency distribution chart visualizes the overall latency of the
transactions in the transaction group. If there are attributes that have a
statistically significant correlation with slow response times, they are listed
in a table below the chart. The table is sorted by correlation coefficients that
range from 0 to 1. Attributes with higher correlation values are more likely to
contribute to high latency transactions. By default, the attribute with the
highest correlation value is added to the chart. To see the latency distribution
for other attributes, hover over their row in the table.

If a correlated attribute seems noteworthy, use the **Filter** quick links:

* `+` creates a new query in the {apm-app} for filtering transactions containing
the selected value.
* `-` creates a new query in the {apm-app} to filter out transactions containing
the selected value.

In this example screenshot, transactions with the field
`labels.orderPriceRange` and value `large` are skewed to the right with slower
response times than the overall latency distribution. If you select the `+`
filter in the appropriate row of the table, it creates a new query in the
{apm-app} for transactions with this attribute. With the "noise" now filtered
out, you can begin viewing sample traces to continue your investigation.

[[correlations-error-rate]]
==== Find failed transaction correlations

The correlations on the *Error rate* tab help you discover which fields are
contributing to failed transactions.

By default, a number of attributes commonly known to cause performance issues,
like version, infrastructure, and location, are included, but all are completely
customizable to your APM data. Find something interesting? A quick click of a 
button will auto-query your data as you work to resolve the underlying issue.

The error rate over time chart visualizes the change in error rate over the selected time frame.
Correlated attributes are sorted by _Impact_–a visual representation of the
{ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html[significant terms aggregation]
score that powers correlations.
Attributes with a high impact, or attributes present in a large percentage of failed transactions,
may contribute to increased error rates.

To find error rate correlations, hover over each potentially correlated attribute to
compare the error rate distribution of transactions with and without the selected attribute.

For example, in the screenshot below, the field `url.original` and value `http://localhost:3100...`
existed in 100% of failed transactions between 6:00 and 10:30.

Select the `+` filter to create a new query in the {apm-app} for transactions with
`url.original: http://localhost:3100...`. With the "noise" now filtered out,
you can begin viewing sample traces to continue your investigation.

As you sift through erroneous transactions, you'll likely notice other interesting attributes.
Return to the correlations fly-out and select *Customize fields* to search on these new attributes.
You may need to do this a few times–each time filtering out more and more noise and bringing you
closer to a diagnosis.

[[correlations-customize-fields]]
=====  Customize fields

By default, a handful of attributes commonly known to cause performance issues
are included in the analysis on the *Error rate* tab. You can add and remove
fields under the **Customize fields** dropdown.

The following fields are selected by default. To keep the default list
manageable, only the first six matching fields with wildcards are used.

**Frontend (RUM) agent:**

* `labels.*`
* `user.*`
* `user_agent.name`
* `user_agent.os.name`
* `url.original`

**Backend agents:**

* `labels.*`
* `host.ip`
* `service.node.name`
* `service.version`

[TIP]
====
* Want to start over? Select **reset** to clear your customizations.
* The *Latency* tab does not have a **Customize fields** dropdown, since it
automatically considers all relevant fields in the transactions.
