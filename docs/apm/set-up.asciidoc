APM is available via the navigation sidebar in {Kib}.
If you have not already installed and configured Elastic APM,
the *Add data* page will get you started.

=== Load the index pattern

Index patterns tell {kib} which {es} indices you want to explore.
An APM index pattern is necessary for certain features in the APM app, like the query bar.
To set up the correct index pattern, on the *Add data* page, click *Load Kibana objects*.

TIP: To use a custom index pattern,
adjust Kibana's <<apm-settings-in-kibana,settings>> or use the <<api-create-apm-index-pattern,Kibana API>>.
