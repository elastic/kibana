=== Dependencies

Many application issues are caused by slow or unresponsive downstream dependencies,
like databases, or remote services provided by a cloud provider or vendor.

APM agents collect details about external calls made from instrumented services.
Sometimes, these external calls resolve into a downstream service that is instrumented --
in these cases, users can utilize distributed tracing to drill down into problematic downstream services.
Other times though, it's not possible to instrument a downstream dependency -- like with a database or third-party service.
A single slow dependency can negatively impact the end-user experience,
so it's important to be able to quickly identify such problems and pinpoint the root cause.
**Dependencies** gives you a window into your uninstrumented, downstream dependencies.

The dependencies detail page shows the latency, throughput,
and failed transaction rate over time for the selected dependency.
You can also easily see the upstream services of the dependency and determine if the dependency is having trouble with one or more services.
