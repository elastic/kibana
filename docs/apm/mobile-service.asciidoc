=== Mobile service overview

Selecting a mobile service brings you to the *Mobile service overview*.
The *Mobile service overview* contains a wide variety of charts and tables that provide
high-level visibility into how a mobile service is performing for your users--enabling you
to make data-driven decisions about how to improve your user experience.

For example, see:

* Crash Rate (Crashes per minute) -- coming soon
* Slowest App load time -- coming soon
* Number of sessions
* Number of HTTP requests
* Map showing the total number of HTTP requests based on country and region
* Most used devices, network connection type, OS version, and app version
* Latency, throughput, and errors over time
* Service dependencies

All of this and more can help you understand how the performance of your backend impacts
user experience on the frontend.
