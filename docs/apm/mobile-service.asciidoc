=== Mobile service overview

Selecting a mobile service brings you to the *Mobile service overview*.
The *Mobile service overview* contains a wide variety of charts and tables that provide
high-level visibility into how a mobile service is performing for your users--enabling you
to make data-driven decisions about how to improve your user experience.

For example, see:

* Crash Rate (Crashes per session)
* Slowest App load time -- coming soon
* Number of sessions
* Number of HTTP requests
* Map showing the total number of HTTP requests based on country and region
* Most used devices, network connection type, OS version, and app version
* Latency, throughput, and errors over time
* Service dependencies

All of these metrics & insights can help SREs and developers better understand the health
of their mobile application environment and the impact of backend errors and bottlenecks on end-user experience.

[[mobile-service-stats]]
=== Quick stats

Understand the impact of slow application load times and variations in application crash rate on user traffic (coming soon).
Visualize session and HTTP trends, and see where your users are located--enabling you to optimize your infrastructure deployment and routing topology.

Note: due to the way crash rate is calculated (crashes per session) it is possible to have greater than 100% rate, due to fact that a session may contain multiple crashes.
