The Machine Learning integration initiates a new job predefined to calculate anomaly scores on APM transaction durations.
Jobs can be created per transaction type, and are based on the service's average response time.

After a machine learning job is created, results are shown in two places:

The transaction duration graph will show the expected bounds and add an annotation when the anomaly score is 75 or above.

Service maps will display a color-coded anomaly indicator based on the detected anomaly score.

=== Create a new machine learning job

To enable machine learning anomaly detection, first choose a service to monitor.
Then, select **Integrations** > **Enable ML anomaly detection** and click **Create job**.

That's it! After a few minutes, the job will begin calculating results;
it might take additional time for results to appear on your graph.
Jobs can be managed in *Machine Learning jobs management*.

APM specific anomaly detection wizards are also available for certain Agents.
See the machine learning {ml-docs}/ootb-ml-jobs-apm.html[APM anomaly detection configurations] for more information.
