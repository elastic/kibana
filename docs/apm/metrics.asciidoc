=== Metrics overview

The *Metrics* overview provides agent-specific metrics,
which lets you perform more in-depth root cause analysis investigations within the APM UI.

If you're experiencing a problem with your service, you can use this page to attempt to find the underlying cause.
For example, you might be able to correlate a high number of errors with a long transaction duration, high CPU usage, or a memory leak.

[[machine-learning-integration]]
=== Machine Learning integration

The Machine Learning integration will initiate a new job predefined to calculate anomaly scores on transaction response times.
The response time graph will show the expected bounds and annotate the graph when the anomaly score is 75 or above.

Jobs can be created per transaction type and based on the average response time.
You can manage jobs in the *Machine Learning jobs management*.
It might take some time for results to appear on the graph.

Machine learning is a platinum feature. For a comparison of the Elastic license levels,
