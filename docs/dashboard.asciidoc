[[dashboard]]
== Dashboard

A Kibana _dashboard_ displays a set of saved visualizations in groups that you can arrange freely. You can save a
dashboard to share or reload at a later time.

==== Building a New Dashboard

The first time you click the *Dashboard* tab, Kibana displays an empty dashboard.

Build your dashboard by adding visualizations. By default, Kibana dashboards use a light color theme. To use a dark color
theme instead, click the *Options* button and check the *Use dark theme* box.

NOTE: You can change the default theme in the *Advanced* section of the *Settings* tab.

==== Adding Visualizations to a Dashboard

To add a visualization to the dashboard, click the *Add* button in the toolbar panel. Select a saved visualization
from the list. You can filter the list of visualizations by typing a filter string into the *Visualization Filter*
field.

The visualization you select appears in a _container_ on your dashboard.

NOTE: If you see a message about the container's height or width being too small, <<resizing-containers,resize the
container>>.

[[saving-dashboards]]
==== Saving Dashboards

To save the dashboard, click the *Save Dashboard* button in the toolbar panel, enter a name for the dashboard in the
*Save As* field, and click the *Save* button. By default, dashboards store the time period specified in the time filter
when you save a dashboard. To disable this behavior, clear the *Store time with dashboard* box before clicking the
*Save* button.

[[loading-a-saved-dashboard]]
==== Loading a Saved Dashboard

Click the *Load Saved Dashboard* button to display a list of existing dashboards. The saved dashboard selector includes
a text field to filter by dashboard name and a link to the Object Editor for managing your saved dashboards. You can
also access the Object Editor by clicking *Settings > Objects*.

[[sharing-dashboards]]
==== Sharing Dashboards

You can share dashboards with other users. You can share a direct link to the Kibana dashboard or embed the dashboard
in your Web page.

NOTE: A user must have Kibana access in order to view embedded dashboards.

To share a dashboard, click the *Share* button image:images/share-dashboard.png[] to display the _Sharing_ panel.

Click the *Copy to Clipboard* button image:images/share-link.png[] to copy the native URL or embed HTML to the clipboard.
Click the *Generate short URL* button image:images/share-short-link.png[] to create a shortened URL for sharing or
embedding.

[[customizing-your-dashboard]]
=== Customizing Dashboard Elements

The visualizations in your dashboard are stored in resizable _containers_ that you can arrange on the dashboard. This
section discusses customizing these containers.

[float]
[[moving-containers]]
==== Moving Containers

Click and hold a container's header to move the container around the dashboard. Other containers will shift as needed
to make room for the moving container. Release the mouse button to confirm the container's new location.

[float]
[[resizing-containers]]
==== Resizing Containers

Move the cursor to the bottom right corner of the container until the cursor changes to point at the corner. After the
cursor changes, click and drag the corner of the container to change the container's size. Release the mouse button to
confirm the new container size.

[float]
[[removing-containers]]
==== Removing Containers

Click the *x* icon at the top right corner of a container to remove that container from the dashboard. Removing a
container from a dashboard does not delete the saved visualization in that container.

[float]
[[viewing-detailed-information]]
==== Viewing Detailed Information

To display the raw data behind the visualization, click the bar at the bottom of the container. Tabs with detailed
information about the raw data replace the visualization, as in this example:

.Table
A representation of the underlying data, presented as a paginated data grid. You can sort the items
in the table by clicking on the table headers at the top of each column.

.Request
The raw request used to query the server, presented in JSON format.
image:images/NYCTA-Request.jpg[]

.Response
The raw response from the server, presented in JSON format.
image:images/NYCTA-Response.jpg[]

.Statistics
A summary of the statistics related to the request and the response, presented as a data grid. The data
grid includes the query duration, the request duration, the total number of records found on the server, and the
index pattern used to make the query.

To export the raw data behind the visualization as a comma-separated-values (CSV) file, click on either the
*Raw* or *Formatted* links at the bottom of any of the detailed information tabs. A raw export contains the data as it
is stored in Elasticsearch. A formatted export contains the results of any applicable Kibana [field formatters].
