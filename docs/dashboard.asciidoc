[[saving-dashboards]]
. When you're finished adding and arranging visualizations,
go to the menu bar, click *Save*, and enter
a name. Optionally, you can store the time period specified in the time
filter by selecting *Store time with dashboard*.

NOTE: By default, Kibana dashboards use a light color theme. To use a dark color theme,
click *Options* and select *Use dark theme*. To use the dark theme by default, go
to *Management > Advanced Settings* and set `dashboard:defaultDarkTheme`
to `On`.


[[customizing-your-dashboard]]
== Arranging Dashboard Elements

The visualizations in your dashboard are stored in containers that you can move,
resize, and delete.

[[moving-containers]]
To move a visualization, click and hold the
header of a visualization and drag to the new location.

[[resizing-containers]]
To resize a visualization, click the resize control on the lower right and drag
to the new dimensions.

[[removing-containers]]
Additional commands for managing the
container and its contents are in the gear menu in the upper right.

NOTE: Deleting a visualization from a
dashboard does _not_ delete the saved visualization.



[[viewing-detailed-information]]
== Viewing Visualization Data

You can display the raw data behind a visualization in a dashboard using the
Expand/Collapse button.

. Open the dashboard.
. Hover over the visualization to display the *Expand* button in the lower
left.
. Click *Expand* to display a table that contains the underlying data.
+
You can also view
the raw Elasticsearch request, the response in JSON, and the request statistics.
These statistics show the query duration, request duration, total number
of matching records, and the index that was searched.
+

To export the data as a comma separated values
(CSV) file, click *Raw* or *Formatted* at the bottom of the data
table. *Raw* exports the data as it is stored in Elasticsearch. *Formatted*
exports the results of an applicable Kibana <<managing-fields,field
formatters>>.

To return to the visualization, click the *Collapse* button in the lower left
corner.

[[sharing-dashboards]]
== Sharing a Dashboard

You can either share a direct link to a Kibana dashboard,
or embed the dashboard in a web page. Users must have Kibana access
to view an embedded dashboard.

[[embedding-dashboards]]

. Open the dashboard you want to share.
. In the menu bar, click *Share*.
. Copy the link you want to share or the iframe you want to embed. You can
share the live dashboard or a static snapshot of the current point in time.
+
TIP: When sharing a link to a dashboard snapshot, use the *Short URL*. Snapshot
URLs are long and can be problematic for Internet Explorer and other
tools.
