. To add a saved search, click the *Saved Search* tab, and then select a name from the list.

[[saving-dashboards]]
. When you're finished adding and arranging the dashboard content,
go to the menu bar, click *Save*, and enter
a name. Optionally, you can store the time period specified in the time
filter by selecting *Store time with dashboard*.

By default, Kibana dashboards use a light color theme. To use a dark color theme,
click *Options* and select *Use dark theme*. To set the dark theme as the default, go
to *Management > Advanced Settings* and set `dashboard:defaultDarkTheme`
to `On`.

TIP: You can import, export, and delete dashboards in *Kibana > Management >
Saved Objects > Dashboards*.

[[customizing-your-dashboard]]
== Arranging Dashboard Elements

The visualizations and searches in a dashboard are stored in panels that you can move,
resize, and delete.  To start editing, open the dashboard and click *Edit*
in the menu bar.

[[moving-containers]]
To move a panel, click and hold the
header of a panel and drag to the new location.

[[resizing-containers]]
To resize a panel, click the resize control on the lower right and drag
to the new dimensions.

[[removing-containers]]
Additional commands for managing the
panel and its contents are in the gear menu in the upper right.

NOTE: Deleting a panel from a
dashboard does *not* delete the saved visualization or search.

[[viewing-detailed-information]]
== Viewing Visualization Data

If your visualization supports it, you can display the raw data behind
the visualization using the Expand/Collapse button.

. Open the dashboard.
. Hover over the visualization and click the *Expand* button in the lower
left.
+
The underlying data is displayed in a table. You can also view
the raw Elasticsearch request, the response in JSON, and the request statistics.
These statistics show the query duration, request duration, total number
of matching records, and the index that was searched.

To export the visualization data as a comma separated values
(CSV) file, click *Raw* or *Formatted* at the bottom of the data
table. *Raw* exports the response data as provided. *Formatted*
exports the reponse data using applicable Kibana <<managing-fields,field
formatters>>.

To return to the visualization, click the *Collapse* button in the lower left
corner.

[[sharing-dashboards]]
== Sharing a Dashboard

You can either share a direct link to a Kibana dashboard,
or embed the dashboard in a web page. Users must have Kibana access
to view an embedded dashboard.

[[embedding-dashboards]]

. Open the dashboard you want to share.
. In the menu bar, click *Share*.
. Copy the link you want to share or the iframe you want to embed. You can
share the live dashboard or a static snapshot of the current point in time.

TIP: You can create a link to a dashboard by title by doing this: +
`${domain}/${basepath?}/app/kibana#/dashboards?title=${yourdashboardtitle}`

TIP: When sharing a link to a dashboard snapshot, use the *Short URL*. Snapshot
URLs are long and can be problematic for Internet Explorer and other
tools.  To create a short URL, you must have write access to `.kibana`.
