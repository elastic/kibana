Enable Filter image:images/filter-enable.png[]:: Click this icon to disable the filter without removing it. You can 
enable the filter again later by clicking the icon again. Disabled filters display a striped shaded color, green for 
inclusion filters and red for exclusion filters.
Pin Filter image:images/filter-pin.png[]:: Click this icon to _pin_ a filter. Pinned filters persist across Kibana tabs.
You can pin filters from the _Visualize_ tab, click on the _Discover_ or _Dashboard_ tabs, and those filters remain in 
place.
NOTE: If you have a pinned filter and you're not seeing any query results, that your current tab's index pattern is one 
that the filter applies to. 
Toggle Filter image:images/filter-toggle.png[]:: Click this icon to _toggle_ a filter. By default, filters are inclusion 
filters, and display in green. Only elements that match the filter are displayed. To change this to an exclusion 
filters, displaying only elements that _don't_ match, toggle the filter. Exclusion filters display in red.
Remove Filter image:images/filter-delete.png[]:: Click this icon to remove a filter entirely.

To apply any of the filter actions to all the filters currently in place, click the image:images/filter-actions.png[] 
*Global Filter Actions* button and select an action.
