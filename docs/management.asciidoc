== Management

The Management application is where you perform your runtime configuration of
Kibana, including both the initial setup and ongoing configuration of index
patterns, advanced settings that tweak the behaviors of Kibana itself, and
the various "objects" that you can save throughout Kibana such as searches,
visualizations, and dashboards.
