== Development Telemetry

To help us provide a good developer experience, we track some straightforward metrics when running certain tasks locally and ship them to a service that we run. To disable this functionality, specify `CI_STATS_DISABLED=true` in your environment.

The operations we current report timing data for:

* Total execution time of `yarn kbn bootstrap`

Along with the execution time of each execution, we ship the following information about your machine to the service:

* The `branch` property from the package.json file
* The value of the `data/uuid` file
