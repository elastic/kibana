== Development Telemetry

In order to help us provide a good developer experience we track some very simple metrics when you run certain tasks locally and ship them to a service that we run. To disable this functionality just specify `CI_STATS_DISABLED=true` in your environment.

The metrics we collect include:

* Total execution time of `yarn kbn bootstrap`

Along with the execution time of each execution we ship the following information about your machine to the service:

* The `branch` property from the package.json file
* https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/os.html#os_os_platform[Operating system platform]
* https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/os.html#os_os_release[Operating system release]
* https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/os.html#os_os_cpus[Count, model, and speed of the CPUs]
* https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/os.html#os_os_arch[CPU Architecture]
