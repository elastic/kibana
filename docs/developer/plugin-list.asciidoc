|<<kibana-dashboard-plugin>>
|- Registers the dashboard application.
- Adds a dashboard embeddable that can be used in other applications.


|{kib-repo}blob/{branch}/src/plugins/data/README.mdx[data]
|The data plugin provides common data access services, such as search and query, for solutions and application developers.


|{kib-repo}blob/{branch}/src/plugins/dev_tools/README.md[devTools]
|The ui/registry/dev_tools is removed in favor of the devTools plugin which exposes a register method in the setup contract.
Registering app works mostly the same as registering apps in core.application.register.
Routing will be handled by the id of the dev tool - your dev tool will be mounted when the URL matches /app/dev_tools#/<YOUR ID>.
This API doesn't support angular, for registering angular dev tools, bootstrap a local module on mount into the given HTML element.

|{kib-repo}blob/{branch}/src/plugins/es_ui_shared/README.md[esUiShared]
|This plugin contains reusable code in the form of self-contained modules (or libraries). Each of these modules exports a set of functionality relevant to the domain of the module.


|<<kibana-expressions-plugin>>
|Expression pipeline is a chain of functions that *pipe* its output to the
input of the next function. Functions can be configured using arguments provided
by the user. The final output of the expression pipeline can be rendered using
one of the *renderers* registered in `expressions` plugin.

All the arguments to expression functions need to be serializable, as well as input and output.
Expression functions should try to stay 'pure'. This makes functions easy to reuse and also 
make it possible to serialize the whole chain as well as output at every step of execution.

Expressions power visualizations in Dashboard and Lens, as well as, every
*element* in Canvas is backed by an expression.

This plugin provides methods which will parse & execute an *expression pipeline*
string for you, as well as a series of registries for advanced users who might
want to incorporate their own functions, types, and renderers into the service
for use in their own application.
