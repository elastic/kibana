|<<kibana-expressions-plugin>>
|Expression pipeline is a chain of functions that *pipe* its output to the
input of the next function. Functions can be configured using arguments provided
by the user. The final output of the expression pipeline can be rendered using
one of the *renderers* registered in `expressions` plugin.

All the arguments to expression functions need to be serializable, as well as input and output.
Expression functions should try to stay 'pure'. This makes functions easy to reuse and also 
make it possible to serialize the whole chain as well as output at every step of execution.

It is possible to add comments to expressions by starting them with a `//` sequence
or by using `/*` and `*/` to enclose multi-line comments.

Expressions power visualizations in Dashboard and Lens, as well as, every
*element* in Canvas is backed by an expression.

This plugin provides methods which will parse & execute an *expression pipeline*
string for you, as well as a series of registries for advanced users who might
want to incorporate their own functions, types, and renderers into the service
for use in their own application.

|<<uiactions-plugin>>
|UI Actions plugins provides API to manage *triggers* and *actions*.

*Trigger* is an abstract description of user's intent to perform an action
(like user clicking on a value inside chart). It allows us to do runtime
binding between code from different plugins. For, example one such
trigger is when somebody applies filters on dashboard; another one is when
somebody opens a Dashboard panel context menu.

*Actions* are pieces of code that execute in response to a trigger. For example,
to the dashboard filtering trigger multiple actions can be attached. Once a user
filters on the dashboard all possible actions are displayed to the user in a
popup menu and the user has to chose one.

In general this plugin provides:

- Creating custom functionality (actions).
- Creating custom user interaction events (triggers).
- Attaching and detaching actions to triggers.
- Emitting trigger events.
- Executing actions attached to a given trigger.
- Exposing a context menu for the user to choose the appropriate action when there are multiple actions attached to a single trigger.

|The Usage Collection Service defines a set of APIs for other plugins to report the usage of their features. At the same time, it provides necessary the APIs for other services (i.e.: telemetry, monitoring, ...) to consume that usage data.


|{kib-repo}blob/{branch}/src/plugins/vis_default_editor/README.md[visDefaultEditor]
|The default editor is used in most primary visualizations, e.x. Area, Data table, Pie, etc.
It acts as a container for a particular visualization and options tabs. Contains the default "Data" tab in public/components/sidebar/data_tab.tsx.
