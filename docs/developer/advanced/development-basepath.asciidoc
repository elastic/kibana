== Considerations for basepath

In dev mode, {kib} by default runs behind a proxy which adds a random path component to its URL.

You can set this explicitly using `server.basePath` in <<settings>>. 

Use the server.rewriteBasePath setting to tell {kib} if it should remove the basePath from requests it receives, and to prevent a deprecation warning at startup. This setting cannot end in a slash (/).

If you want to turn off the basepath when in development mode, start {kib} with the `--no-base-path` flag

[source,bash]

yarn start --no-base-path
