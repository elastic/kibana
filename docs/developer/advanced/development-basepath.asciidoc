== Considerations for basepath

In dev mode, {kib} by default runs behind a proxy which adds a random path component to its URL.

You can set this explicitly using <<server-basePath,`server.basePath`>>. This setting cannot end in a slash (/).

Use <<server-rewriteBasePath,`server.rewriteBasePath`>> to tell {kib} if it should remove the basePath from requests it receives, and to prevent a deprecation warning at startup. 

If you want to turn off the basepath when in development mode, start {kib} with the `--no-base-path` flag

[source,bash]

yarn start --no-base-path
