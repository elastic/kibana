== Interpreting CI Failures

{kib} CI uses a Jenkins feature called "Pipelines" to automate testing of the code in pull requests and on tracked branches. Pipelines are defined within the repository via the `Jenkinsfile` at the root of the project.

More information about Jenkins Pipelines can be found link:https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/[in the Jenkins book].

=== Github Checks

When a test fails it will be reported to Github via Github Checks. We currently bucket tests into several categories which run in parallel to make CI faster. Groups like `ciGroup{X}` get a single check in Github, and other tests like linting, or type checks, get their own checks.

Clicking the link next to the check in the conversation tab of a pull request will take you to the log output from that section of the tests. If that log output is truncated, or doesn't clearly identify what happened, you can usually get more complete information by visiting Jenkins directly.

=== Viewing Job Executions in Jenkins

To view the results of a job execution in Jenkins, either click the link in the comment left by `@elasticmachine` or search for the `kibana-ci` check in the list at the bottom of the PR. This link will take you to the top-level page for the specific job execution that failed.

1. *Git Changes:* the list of commits that were in this build which weren't in the previous build. For Pull Requests this list is calculated by comparing against the most recent Pull Request which was tested, it is not limited to build for this specific Pull Request, so it's not very useful.
2. *Test Results:* A link to the test results screen, and shortcuts to the failed tests. Functional tests capture and store the log output from each specific test, and make it visible at these links. For other test runners only the error message is visible and log output must be tracked down in the *Pipeline Steps*.
3. *Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Upload Report:* Link to the screen which lists out the artifacts uploaded to GCS during this job execution.
4. *Pipeline Steps:*: A breakdown of the pipeline that was executed, along with individual log output for each step in the pipeline.

=== Viewing ciGroup/test Logs

To view the logs for a failed specific ciGroup, jest, type checkers, linters, etc., click on the *Pipeline Steps* link in from the Job page.

image::images/pipeline_steps_view.png[Jenkins pipeline steps screenshot]

Scroll down the page until you find a failed step *(1)*, and then look up a few lines for the `Branch:` step to see which specific job this is. If this is the job you're looking for click the little terminal icon next to the failed step *(1)* to view the logs for that specific step in the Pipeline.

=== Debugging Functional UI Test Failures

The logs in Pipeline Steps contain `Info` level logging.  To debug Functional UI tests it's usually helpful to see the debug logging.  You can go to the list of all tests including failures (1), or directly to the failures (2).

Looking at the failure, we first look at the Error and stack trace. In the example below, this test failed to find an element within the timeout;
 `Error: retry.try timeout: TimeoutError: Waiting for element to be located By(css selector, [data-test-subj="createSpace"])`

We know the test file from the stack trace was on line 50 of `test/accessibility/apps/spaces.ts` (this test and the stack trace context is kibana/x-pack/ so the file is https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/test/accessibility/apps/spaces.ts#L50).
The function to click on the element was called from a page object method in `test/functional/page_objects/space_selector_page.ts` https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/test/functional/page_objects/space_selector_page.ts#L58

But we don't know _why_ the test didn't find the element.  It could be that its not on the right page, or that the element has changed.

Just above the `✖ fail:` line, there is a line `info Taking screenshot ...` which tells us the name of the screenshot to look for in the *Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Upload Report:*

Clicking the `[Download]` link for that png shows this image:

image::images/a11y_screenshot.png[Kibana spaces page meets a11y validations a11y test for click on create space page.png]

If we use a running Kibana instance and inspect elements, we find that the `createSpace` data-test-subj attribute is on this button in the Spaces page in Stack Management:

image::images/inspect_element.png[Kibana screenshot of Spaces page with developer tools open]

We know the test was not on the correct page to find the element to click. We see in the debug log the repeated attempts to find the element. If we scroll to the start of those repeated attempts, we see that the first thing the test did was this attempt to click on the `createSpace` element.  


    [00:01:30]           └-> a11y test for manage spaces menu from top nav on Kibana home
    [00:01:30]           └-> a11y test for manage spaces page
    [00:01:30]           └-> a11y test for click on create space page
    [00:01:30]             └-> "before each" hook: global before each for "a11y test for click on create space page"
    [00:01:30]             │ debg TestSubjects.click(createSpace)


And we can confirm that looking at the test code.

So we need to backtrack further to find where the test opens the Spaces page. It turns out that the test before this one would have navigated to the proper page, but the test is skipped (marked `it.skip` in a PR). 

    it.skip('a11y test for manage spaces page', async () => {
      await PageObjects.spaceSelector.clickManageSpaces();

Perhaps someone skipped the previous tests not realizing that the tests were not independent. A best practice would be for every test to be atomic and not depend on the results of any other test(s). But in UI testing, the setup takes time and we generally need to optimize for groups of tests within a describe block.
