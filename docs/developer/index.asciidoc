= Developer guide

--

NOTE: This is our legacy developer guide, and while we strive to keep it accurate, new content is added inside the {kib-repo}blob/{branch}/dev_docs[Kibana repo]. Internal developers can access this content rendered in our https://docs.elastic.dev/kibana-dev-docs/getting-started/welcome[Kibana Developer Guide]. External developers can access this information from the repository, however links won't work. We hope to eventually make the rendered guide public for the benefit of external developers.

Contributing to {kib} can be daunting at first, but it doesn't have to be. The following sections should get you up and
running in no time. If you have any problems, file an issue in the https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues[Kibana repo].

* <<development-getting-started>>
* <<development-best-practices>>
* <<contributing>>
* <<external-plugin-development>>
* <<kibana-architecture>>
* <<advanced>>
* <<plugin-list>>
* <<development-telemetry>>
