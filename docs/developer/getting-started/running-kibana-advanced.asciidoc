== Running {kib}

Change to your local {kib} directory. Start the development server.

[source,bash]
----
yarn start
----

____
On Windows, you’ll need to use Git Bash, Cygwin, or a similar shell that
exposes the `sh` command. And to successfully build you’ll need Cygwin
optional packages zip, tar, and shasum.
____

Now you can point your web browser to http://localhost:5601 and start
using {kib}! When running `yarn start`, {kib} will also log that it
is listening on port 5603 due to the base path proxy, but you should
still access {kib} on port 5601.

By default, you can log in with username `elastic` and password
`changeme`. See the `--help` options on `yarn es <command>` if
you’d like to configure a different password.

=== Running {kib} in Open-Source mode

If you’re looking to only work with the open-source software, supply the
license type to `yarn es`:

[source,bash]
----
yarn es snapshot --license oss
----

And start {kib} with only open-source code:

[source,bash]
----
yarn start --oss
----

=== Unsupported URL Type

If you’re installing dependencies and seeing an error that looks
something like

....
Unsupported URL Type: link:packages/eslint-config-kibana
....

you’re likely running `npm`. To install dependencies in {kib} you
need to run `yarn kbn bootstrap`. For more info, see
link:#setting-up-your-development-environment[Setting Up Your
Development Environment] above.

=== Customizing `config/kibana.dev.yml`

The `config/kibana.yml` file stores user configuration directives.
Since this file is checked into source control, however, developer
preferences can’t be saved without the risk of accidentally committing
the modified version. To make customizing configuration easier during
development, the {kib} CLI will look for a `config/kibana.dev.yml`
file if run with the `--dev` flag. This file behaves just like the
non-dev version and accepts any of the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/settings.html[standard
settings].

=== Potential Optimization Pitfalls

* Webpack is trying to include a file in the bundle that was deleted and
is now complaining about it being missing
* A module id that used to resolve to a single file now resolves to a
directory, but webpack isn’t adapting
* (if you discover other scenarios, please send a PR!)

=== Setting Up SSL

{kib} includes self-signed certificates that can be used for
development purposes in the browser and for communicating with
{es}: `yarn start --ssl` & `yarn es snapshot --ssl`.
