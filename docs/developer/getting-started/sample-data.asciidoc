== Installing sample data

There are a couple ways to easily get data ingested into {es}.

[discrete]
=== Sample data packages available for one click installation

The easiest is to install one or more of our available sample data packages. If you have no data, you should be 
prompted to install when running {kib} for the first time. You can also access and install the sample data packages
by going to the home page and clicking "add sample data".

[discrete]
=== makelogs script

The provided `makelogs` script will generate sample data.

[source,bash]
----
node scripts/makelogs --auth <username>:<password>
----

The default username and password combination are `elastic:changeme`

Make sure to execute `node scripts/makelogs` *after* {es} is up and running!

=== CSV upload

You can also use the CSV uploader provided on the {kib} home page.
Navigate to **Add data** > **Upload file** to upload your data from a file.
