== Installing sample data

There are a couple ways to easily get data ingested into {es}.

[discrete]
=== Sample data packages available for one click installation

The easiest is to install one or more of our vailable sample data packages. If you have no data, you should be 
prompted to install when running {kib} for the first time. You can also access and install the sample data packages
by going to the home page and clicking "add sample data".

=== makelogs script

The provided `makelogs` script will generate sample data.

[source,bash]
----
node scripts/makelogs --auth <username>:<password>
----

The default username and password combination are `elastic:changeme`

Make sure to execute `node scripts/makelogs` *after* {es} is up and running!

=== CSV upload

If running with a platinum or trial license, you can also use the CSV uploader provided inside the Machine learning app.
Navigate to the Data visualizer to upload your data from a file.
