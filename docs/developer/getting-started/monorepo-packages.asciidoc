== {kib} Monorepo Packages

Currently {kib} works as a monorepo composed by a core, plugins and packages.
The latest are located in a folder called `packages` and are pieces of software that 
composes a set of features that can be isolated and reused across the entire repository.
They are also supposed to be able to imported just like any other `node_module`.

Previously we relied solely on `@kbn/pm` to manage the development tools of those packages, but we are 
now in the middle of migrating those responsibilities into Bazel. Every package already migrated 
will contain in its root folder a `BUILD.bazel` file and other `build` and `watching` strategies should be used.

Remember that any time you need to make sure the monorepo is ready to be used just run:

[source,bash]
----
yarn kbn bootstrap
----

Non Bazel packages can be built independently with

[source,bash]
----
yarn kbn run build -i PACKAGE_NAME

=== Watching Non Bazel Packages

Non Bazel packages can be watched independently with

[source,bash]

=== Building Bazel Packages

Bazel packages are built as a whole for now. You can use:

[source,bash]
----
yarn kbn build-bazel
