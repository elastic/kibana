=== Building OS packages

Packages are built using fpm, dpkg, and rpm.  Package building has only been tested on Linux and is not supported on any other platform.


[source,bash]
----
apt-get install ruby-dev rpm
gem install fpm -v 1.5.0
yarn build --skip-archives
----

To specify a package to build you can add `rpm` or `deb` as an argument.


[source,bash]
----
yarn build --rpm
----

Distributable packages can be found in `target/` after the build completes.
