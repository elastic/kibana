=== Building OS packages

Packages are built using fpm, dpkg, and rpm, and Docker.  Package building has only been tested on Linux and is not supported on any other platform.
Docker installation instructions can be found at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Install Docker Engine].

[source,bash]
----
apt-get install ruby ruby-dev rpm dpkg build-essential
gem install fpm -v 1.5.0
yarn build --skip-archives
----

To specify a package to build you can add `rpm` or `deb` as an argument.


[source,bash]
----
yarn build --rpm
----

Distributable packages can be found in `target/` after the build completes.
