== Architecture

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
{kib} developer services and apis are in a state of constant development. We cannot provide backwards compatibility at this time due to the high rate of change.
==============================================

Our developer services are changing all the time. One of the best ways to discover and learn about them is to read the available
READMEs from all the plugins inside our {kib-repo}tree/{branch}/src/plugins[open source plugins folder] and our
{kib-repo}/tree/{branch}/x-pack/plugins[commercial plugins folder].

A few services also automatically generate api documentation which can be browsed inside the {kib-repo}tree/{branch}/docs/development[docs/development section of our repo]

A few notable services are called out below.

* <<development-security>>
* <<add-data-tutorials>>
* <<development-visualize-index>>
