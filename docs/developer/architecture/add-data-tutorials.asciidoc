== Add data tutorials

`Add Data` in the {kib} Home application contains tutorials for setting up data flows in the Elastic stack.

Each tutorial contains three sets of instructions:

* `On Premise.` Set up a data flow when both {kib} and {es} are running on premise.
* `On Premise Elastic Cloud.` Set up a data flow when {kib} is running on premise and {es} is running on Elastic Cloud.
* `Elastic Cloud.` Set up a data flow when both {kib} and {es} are running on Elastic Cloud.

=== Creating a new tutorial
1. Create a new directory in the link:https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/src/plugins/home/server/tutorials[tutorials directory].
2. In the new directory, create a file called `index.ts` that exports a function.
The function must return a function object that conforms to the `TutorialSchema` interface link:{kib-repo}tree/{branch}/src/plugins/home/server/services/tutorials/lib/tutorial_schema.ts[tutorial schema].
3. Register the tutorial in link:{kib-repo}tree/{branch}/src/plugins/home/server/tutorials/register.ts[register.ts] by adding it to the `builtInTutorials`.
// TODO update path once assets are migrated
4. Add image assets to the link:{kib-repo}tree/{branch}/src/legacy/core_plugins/kibana/public/home/tutorial_resources[tutorial_resources directory].
5. Run {kib} locally to preview the tutorial.
6. Create a PR and go through the review process to get the changes approved.

If you are creating a new plugin and the tutorial is only related to that plugin, you can also place the `TutorialSchema` object into your plugin folder. Add `home` to the `requiredPlugins` list in your `kibana.json` file.
Then register the tutorial object by calling `home.tutorials.registerTutorial(tutorialObject)` in the `setup` lifecycle of your server plugin.
