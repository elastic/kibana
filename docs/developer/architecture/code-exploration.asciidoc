=== Exploring Kibana code

The goals of our folder heirarchy are:

- Easy for developers to know where to add new services, plugins and applications.
- Easy for developers to know where to find the code from services, plugins and applications.
- Easy to browse and understand our folder structure.

To that aim, we strive to:

- Avoid too many files in any given folder.
- Choose clear, unambigious folder names.
- Organize by domain.
- Every folder should contain a README that describes the contents of that folder.
