== {kib} Core API

experimental[]

{kib} Core provides a set of low-level API's required to run all {kib} plugins.
These API's are injected into your plugin's lifecycle methods and may be invoked during that lifecycle only:

[source,typescript]
----
import type { PluginInitializerContext, CoreSetup, CoreStart } from 'kibana/server';

export class MyPlugin {
  constructor(initializerContext: PluginInitializerContext) {}

  public setup(core: CoreSetup) {
    // called when plugin is setting up during Kibana's startup sequence
  }

  public start(core: CoreStart) {
    // called after all plugins are set up
  }

  public stop() {
    // called when plugin is torn down during Kibana's shutdown sequence
  }
}
----

The services that core provides are:

* <<application-service, Application service>>
* <<configuration-service, Configuration service>>
* <<elasticsearch-service, Elasticsearch service>>
* <<http-service, HTTP service>>
* <<logging-service, Logging service>>
* <<saved-objects-service, Saved Objects service>>
* <<ui-settings-service, UI settings service>>
