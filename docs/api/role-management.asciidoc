== Role Management API

experimental[This API is *experimental* and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. The underlying mechanism of enforcing role based access control is stable, but the APIs for managing the roles are currently experimental.]

The role management API allows people to manage roles that grant <<kibana-privileges>>.
It is *not* supported to do so using the
{ref}/security-api-roles.html[{es} Role Management APIs], and doing 
so will likely cause {kib}'s authorization to behave unexpectedly.
