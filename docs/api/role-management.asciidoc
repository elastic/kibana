== Role Management API

[NOTE]
.Stable API
==========================
This is a stable API, and breaking changes should only occur in major versions and will be
clearly documented in the breaking changes documentation for that release.
==========================

The role management API allows people to manage roles that grant Kibana Privileges.
It is *not* supported to do so using the
{ref}/security-api-roles.html[Elasticsearch Role Management APIs], and doing 
so will likely cause Kibana's authorization to behave unexpectedly.
