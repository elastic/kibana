== Kibana Role Management API

experimental[This API is *experimental* and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. The underlying mechanism of enforcing role based access control is stable, but the APIs for managing the roles are currently experimental.]

The role management API allows people to manage roles that grant <<kibana-privileges>>.
It is *not* supported to do so using the
{ref}/security-api.html#security-role-apis[{es} role management APIs], and doing 
so will likely cause {kib}'s authorization to behave unexpectedly. 

NOTE: You cannot access these endpoints via the Console in Kibana.
