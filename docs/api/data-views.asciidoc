== Data views API

Manage data views, formerly known as {kib} index patterns.

For the latest details, refer to {api-kibana}/group/endpoint-data-views[data view APIs].

WARNING: Do not write documents directly to the `.kibana` index. When you write directly
to the `.kibana` index, the data becomes corrupted and permanently breaks future {kib} versions.
