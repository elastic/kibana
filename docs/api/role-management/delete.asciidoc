=== Delete Role

To delete a role in Elasticsearch's `native realm, submit a DELETE request to the `/api/security/role/<rolename>`
endpoint:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE /api/security/role/my_admin_role
--------------------------------------------------
// KIBANA

If the role is successfully deleted, the response code is `204`; otherwise, the response
code will be 404.
