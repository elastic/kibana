=== Bulk Get Objects

beta[This functionality is *beta*. It's on track to become a stable, permanent feature of {kib}. Caution should be exercised because it is possible a breaking change to these APIs will occur in a minor version, but weâ€™ll avoid this wherever possible. ]

The bulk-get saved object API enables you to retrieve multiple Kibana saved
objects by id.

Note: You cannot access this endpoint via the Console in Kibana.

==== Request

`POST /api/saved_objects/_bulk_get`

==== Request Body

The request body must be a JSON array containing objects, each of which
contains the following properties:

`type` (required)::
  (string) Valid options, include: `visualization`, `dashboard`, `search`, `index-pattern`, `config`, and `timelion-sheet`

`id` (required)::
  (string) ID of object to retrieve

`fields` (optional)::
  (array) The fields to return in the object's response

==== Response body

The response body will have a top level `saved_objects` property that contains
an array of objects, which represent the response for each of the requested
objects. The order of the objects in the response is identical to the order of
the objects in the request.

For any saved object that could not be found, an error object will exist in its
place.

==== Examples

The following example attempts to retrieve an index pattern with id
`my-pattern` and a dashboard with id `my-dashboard`, but only the index pattern
exists.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST api/saved_objects/_bulk_get
[
  {
    "type": "index-pattern",
    "id": "my-pattern"
  },
  {
    "type": "dashboard",
    "id": "my-dashboard"
  }
]
--------------------------------------------------
// KIBANA

A successful call returns a response code of `200` and a response body
containing a JSON structure similar to the following example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "saved_objects": [
    {
      "id": "my-pattern",
      "type": "index-pattern",
      "version": 1,
      "attributes": {
        "title": "my-pattern-*"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "my-dashboard",
      "type": "dashboard",
      "error": {
        "statusCode": 404,
        "message": "Not found"
      }
    }
  ]
}
