[[saved-objects-api-create]]
=== Create Object

beta[This functionality is *beta*. It's on track to become a stable, permanent feature of {kib}. Caution should be exercised because it is possible a breaking change to these APIs will occur in a minor version, but weâ€™ll avoid this wherever possible. ]

The create saved object API enables you to persist a Kibana saved object.

Note: You cannot access this endpoint via the Console in Kibana.

==== Request

`POST /api/saved_objects/<type>` +

`POST /api/saved_objects/<type>/<id>`

==== Path Parameters

`type` (required)::
  (string) Valid options, include: `visualization`, `dashboard`, `search`, `index-pattern`, `config`, and `timelion-sheet`

`id` (optional)::
  (string) Enables specifying an ID to use, as opposed to one being randomly generated


==== Query Parameters

`overwrite` (optional)::
  (boolean) If true, will overwrite the document with the same ID.


==== Request Body

`attributes` (required)::
  (object) The data to persist

`references` (optional)::
  (array) An array of objects with `name`, `id`, and `type` properties that describe the other saved objects this object references. The `name` can be used in the attributes to refer to the other saved object, but never the `id`, which may be updated automatically in the future during migrations or import/export.

==== Examples

The following example creates an index pattern object with a pattern of
`my-pattern-*`.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST api/saved_objects/index-pattern/my-pattern
{
  "attributes": {
    "title": "my-pattern-*"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// KIBANA

A successful call returns a response code of `200` and a response body
containing a JSON structure similar to the following example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "id": "my-pattern", <1>
  "type": "index-pattern",
  "version": 1,
  "attributes": {
    "title": "my-pattern-*"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

<1> If `my-pattern` was not specified in the path, a unique ID would have been
generated.

==== Known issues

1. *Attributes are not validated at creation time*. This means you can pass
arbitrary and ill-formed data into this API that can break Kibana. Make sure
any data you send to this API is properly formed.
