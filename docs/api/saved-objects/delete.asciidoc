[[saved-objects-api-delete]]
=== Delete Object

beta[This functionality is *beta*. It's on track to become a stable, permanent feature of {kib}. Caution should be exercised because it is possible a breaking change to these APIs will occur in a minor version, but weâ€™ll avoid this wherever possible. ]

The delete saved object API permanently removes a Kibana saved object. Once a
saved object has been deleted, _it cannot be recovered_.

Note: You cannot access this endpoint via the Console in Kibana.
