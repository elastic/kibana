[[saved-objects-api-update]]
=== Update Object

experimental[This functionality is *experimental* and may be changed or removed completely in a future release.]

The update saved object API enables you to update the attributes for an
existing Kibana saved object.

Note: You cannot access this endpoint via the Console in Kibana.

==== Request

`PUT /api/saved_objects/<type>/<id>`

==== Path Parameters

`type` (required)::
  (string) Valid options, include: `visualization`, `dashboard`, `search`, `index-pattern`, `config`, and `timelion-sheet`

`id` (required)::
  (string) ID of object to update


==== Request Body

`attributes` (required)::
  (object) The data to persist

`references` (optional)::
  (array) An array of objects with `name`, `id`, and `type` properties that describe the other saved objects this object references. The `name` can be used in the attributes to refer to the other saved object, but never the `id`, which may be updated automatically in the future during migrations or import/export.

==== Examples

The following example updates an existing index pattern object identified as
`my-pattern` with a different index pattern title.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT api/saved_objects/index-pattern/my-pattern
{
  "attributes": {
    "title": "some-other-pattern-*"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// KIBANA

A successful call returns a response code of `200` and a response body
containing a JSON structure similar to the following example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "id": "my-pattern",
  "type": "index-pattern",
  "version": 2,
  "attributes": {
    "title": "some-other-pattern-*"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

==== Known issues

1. *Attributes are not validated at update time*. This means you can pass
arbitrary and ill-formed data into this API that can break Kibana. Make sure
any data you send to this API is properly formed.
