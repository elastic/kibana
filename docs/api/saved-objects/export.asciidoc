=== Export Objects

beta[This functionality is *beta*. It's on track to become a stable, permanent feature of {kib}. Caution should be exercised because it is possible a breaking change to these APIs will occur in a minor version, but weâ€™ll avoid this wherever possible. ]

The export saved objects API enables you to retrieve a set of saved objects that can later be imported into Kibana.

Note: You cannot access this endpoint via the Console in Kibana.

==== Request

`POST /api/saved_objects/_export`

==== Request Body
`type` (optional)::
  (array|string) The saved object type(s) that the export should be limited to
`objects` (optional)::
  (array) A list of objects to export
`includeReferencesDeep` (optional)::
  (boolean) This will make the exported objects include all the referenced objects needed

Note: At least `type` or `objects` must be passed in.

==== Response body

The response body will have a format of newline delimited JSON.

==== Examples

The following example exports all index pattern saved objects.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST api/saved_objects/_export
{
  "type": "index-pattern"
}
--------------------------------------------------
// KIBANA

A successful call returns a response code of `200` along with the exported objects as the response body.

The following example exports specific saved objects.

[source,js]

POST api/saved_objects/_export
{
  "objects": [
    {
