== Saved objects APIs

Manage {kib} saved objects, including dashboards, visualizations, and more.

WARNING: Do not write documents directly to the `.kibana` index. When you write directly
to the `.kibana` index, the data becomes corrupted and permanently breaks future {kib} versions.

NOTE: For managing {kib} index patterns, use the <<index-patterns-api, index patterns API>>.
