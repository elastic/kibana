== Saved Objects API

The saved objects API allows people to manage Kibana saved objects, including
but not limited to dashboards, visualizations, and index patterns.

Traditionally, developers would perform this level of integration by writing
documents directly to the `.kibana` index. *Do not do this!* Writing directly
to the `.kibana` index is not safe and it _will_ result in corrupted data that
permanently breaks Kibana in a future version.
