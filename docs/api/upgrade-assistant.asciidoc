== Upgrade Assistant API

experimental[This API is *experimental* and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. The underlying Spaces concepts are stable, but the APIs for managing Spaces are currently experimental.]

The Upgrade Assistant API allows you to check the upgrade status of your Elasticsearch Cluster
and reindex indices that were created in the previous major version. The tools help you prepare
for the next major version of Elasticsearch.
