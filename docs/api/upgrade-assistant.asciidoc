== Upgrade Assistant API

experimental[This API is *experimental* and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. The underlying Upgrade Assistant concepts are stable, but the APIs for managing Upgrade Assistant are currently experimental.]

The Upgrade Assistant API allows you to check the upgrade status of your Elasticsearch cluster
and reindex indices that were created in the previous major version. The assistant helps you prepare
for the next major version of Elasticsearch.
