== URL Shortening API

Kibana URLs contain the state of the application making them very long and cumbersome.
Internet Explorer has URL length restrictions, and some wiki and markup parsers don't do well with the full-length version of the Kibana URL.

The short URLs enabled by this API are designed to make sharing Kibana URLs easier.

NOTE: You cannot access these endpoints via the Console in Kibana.
