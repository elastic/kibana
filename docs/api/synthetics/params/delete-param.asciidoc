Deletes one or more parameters from the system.

=== {api-request-title}

`DELETE <your-api-host>/api/synthetics/params`

=== {api-prereq-title}

To use this API, you must have appropriate permissions for deleting parameters.

[[parameters-delete-request-body]]
==== Request Body

The request body should contain an array of parameter IDs that you want to delete.

`ids`::
(Required, array of strings) An array of parameter IDs to delete.

[[parameters-delete-response-example]]
==== Response Example

The API response includes information about the deleted parameters, where each entry in the response array contains the following attributes:

- `id` (string): The unique identifier of the deleted parameter.
- `deleted` (boolean): Indicates whether the parameter was successfully deleted (`true` if deleted, `false` if not).

Here's an example response for deleting multiple parameters:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
[
  {
    "id": "param1-id",
    "deleted": true
  },
  {
    "id": "param2-id",
    "deleted": true
  }
]
--------------------------------------------------

This API allows you to delete one or more parameters by specifying their IDs in the request body. The response array provides information about the success of the deletion process for each parameter. You can replace `<your-api-host>` with the actual host where your API is available.
