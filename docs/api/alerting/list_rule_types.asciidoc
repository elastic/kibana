Retrieve a list of rule types that the user is authorized to access.

[[list-rule-types-api-request]]
=== {api-request-title}

`GET <kibana host>:<port>/api/alerting/rule_types`

`GET <kibana host>:<port>/s/<space_id>/api/alerting/rule_types`

=== {api-prereq-title}

If you have `read` privileges for one or more {kib} features, the API response
contains information about the appropriate rule types. For example, there are
rule types associated with the *Management* > *Stack Rules* feature,
*Analytics* > *Discover* and *{ml-app}* features, *{observability}*, and
*Security* features. To get rule types associated with the
*{stack-monitor-app}* feature, use the `monitoring_user` built-in role.

For more details, refer to <<kibana-feature-privileges>>.

=== {api-description-title}

Each rule type includes a list of authorized consumer features. For each feature,
users are authorized to perform either `read` or `all` operations on rules of
that type. This enables you to determine which rule types you can read, create,
or modify. If you want to create or edit a rule in {kib}, some rule types are
limited to specific features and apps.

[[list-rule-types-api-params]]
=== {api-path-parms-title}

`space_id`::
(Optional, string) An identifier for the space. If `space_id` is not provided in
the URL, the default space is used.

[[list-rule-types-response]]
=== {api-response-body-title}

Each rule type has the following properties in the API response:

`action_groups`::
(array of objects) An explicit list of groups for which the rule type can
schedule actions, each with the action group's unique ID and human readable name.
Rule `actions` validation uses this configuration to ensure that groups are
valid.

`action_variables`::
(object) A list of action variables that the rule type makes available via
context and state in action parameter templates, and a short human readable
description. When you create a rule in {kib}, it uses this information to prompt
you for these variables in action parameter editors.

`authorized_consumers`::
(object) The list of the plugins IDs that have access to the rule type.

`default_action_group_id`::
(string) The default ID for the rule type group.

`does_set_recovery_context`::
(boolean) Indicates whether the rule passes context variables to its recovery
action.

`enabled_in_license`::
(boolean) Indicates whether the rule type is enabled or disabled based on the
subscription.

`id`::
(string) The unique identifier for the rule type.

`is_exportable`::
(boolean) Indicates whether the rule type is exportable in *{stack-manage-app}*
> *Saved Objects*.

`minimum_license_required`::
(string) The {subscriptions}[subscriptions] required to use the rule type.

`name`::
(string) The descriptive name of the rule type.

`producer`::
(string) An identifier for the application that produces this rule type.

`recovery_action_group`::
(object) An action group to use when an alert goes from an active state to an
inactive one.
