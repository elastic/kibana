Retrieve a list of rule types that the user is authorized to access.

=== {api-description-title}

Each rule type includes a list of consumer features. Within these features,
users are authorized to perform either `read` or `all` operations on rules of
that type. This helps determine which rule types users can read, but not create
or modify.

NOTE: Some rule types are limited to specific features, which might not be
available when <<create-edit-rules,defining rules>> in *{stack-manage-app}*.

[[list-rule-types-api-params]]
=== {api-path-parms-title}

`space_id`::
(Optional, string) An identifier for the space. If `space_id` is not provided in
the URL, the default space is used.

[[list-rule-types-response]]
=== {api-response-body-title}

Each rule type has the following properties in the API response:

`action_groups`::
(array of objects) An explicit list of groups for which the rule type can
schedule actions, each with the action group's unique ID and human readable name.
Rule `actions` validation uses this configuration to ensure that groups are
valid. Use `kbn-i18n` to translate the names of the action group when
registering the rule type.
//TBD: The kbn-i18n phrase doesn't seem appropriate for this context. Can we remove it?

`action_variables`::
(object) An explicit list of action variables that the rule type makes available
via context and state in action parameter templates, and a short human readable
description. The Rule UI uses this information to prompt users for these
variables in action parameter editors. Use `kbn-i18n` to translate the
descriptions.
//TBD: What is the intent of "explicit list"? Can we drop "explicit"?
//TBD: Which "Rule UI" does this refer to? Is it only the "Rules and Connectors" UI in Stack Management? Or do all apps use this information?
//TBD: The kbn-i18n sentence seems out of context here too. Can we remove it?

`authorized_consumers`::
(object) The list of the plugins IDs that have access to the rule type.

`default_action_group_id`::
(string) The default ID for the rule type group.

`does_set_recovery_context`::
(boolean) 
// TBD: What does this property mean?

`enabled_in_license`::
(boolean) Indicates whether the rule type is enabled or disabled based on the
subscription.

`id`::
(string) The unique identifier for the rule type.

`is_exportable`
(boolean) Indicates whether the rule type is exportable in *{stack-manage-app}*
> *Saved Objects*.

`minimum_license_required`::
(string) The {subscriptions} required to use the rule type.

`name`::
(string) The descriptive name of the rule type.

`producer`::
(string) An identifier for the application that produces this rule type.

`recovery_action_group`::
(object) An action group to use when an alert goes from an active state to an
inactive one. Do not specify this action group under the `action_groups`
property. If `recovery_action_group` is not specified, the default `recovered` action group is used.
//TBD: The "Do not use..." phrase doesn't seem appropriate here, since we're listing not setting these properties. Can we remove it?

`200`::
    Indicates a successful call.

For example, if you have `read` privileges for the {observability} {logs-app},
the API returns the following:
