experimental[] List all centrally-managed Logstash pipelines.

IMPORTANT: Limit the number of pipelines to 10k or fewer. As the number of pipelines nears and surpasses 10k, you may see performance issues on {kib}.

[[logstash-configuration-management-api-list-example]]
==== Example

The API returns the following:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "pipelines": [
    {
      "id": "hello-world",
      "description": "Just a simple pipeline",
      "last_modified": "2018-04-14T12:23:29.772Z",
      "username": "elastic" <1>
    },
    {
      "id": "sleepy-pipeline",
      "description": "",
      "last_modified": "2018-03-24T03:41:30.554Z"
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------

<1> The `username` property appears when security is enabled, and depends on when the pipeline was created or last updated.
