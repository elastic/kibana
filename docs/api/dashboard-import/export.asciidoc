[[dashboard-import-api-export]]
=== Export Dashboard

experimental[This functionality is *experimental* and may be changed or removed completely in a future release.]

The dashboard export API allows people to export dashboards along with all of
their corresponding saved objects such as visualizations, saved searches, and
index patterns.

==== Request

`GET /api/kibana/dashboards/export`

==== Query Parameters

`dashboard` (optional)::
  (array|string) The id(s) of the dashboard(s) to export

==== Response body

The response body will have a top level `objects` property that contains an
array of saved objects. The order of these objects is not guaranteed. You
should use this exact response body as the request body for the corresponding
<<dashboard-import-api-import, Import Dashboard API>>.

==== Examples

The following example exports all saved objects associated with and including
the dashboard with id `942dcef0-b2cd-11e8-ad8e-85441f0c2e5c`.
