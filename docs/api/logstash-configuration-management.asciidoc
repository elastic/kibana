== Logstash Configuration Management API

The Logstash configuration management API allows users to programmatically integrate with the
Logstash configuration management feature.

Traditionally users would perform this integration by accessing the the `.logstash` index
directly. *Do not do this!* The structure of this index is subject to change, which could
cause your integration to break. Instead, use the following API.

* <<logstash-configuration-management-api-create>>
* <<logstash-configuration-management-api-retrieve>>
* <<logstash-configuration-management-api-delete>>
* <<logstash-configuration-management-api-list>>
