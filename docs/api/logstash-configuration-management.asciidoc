== Logstash configuration management APIs

Programmatically integrate with the Logstash configuration management feature.

WARNING: Do not directly access the `.logstash` index. The structure of the `.logstash` index is subject to change, which could cause your integration to break. Instead, use the Logstash configuration management APIs. 

The following Logstash configuration management APIs are available:

* <<logstash-configuration-management-api-delete, Delete Logstash pipeline API>> to delete a centrally-managed Logstash pipeline

* <<logstash-configuration-management-api-list, List Logstash pipeline API>> to list all centrally-managed Logstash pipelines

* <<logstash-configuration-management-api-create, Create Logstash pipeline API>> to create a centrally-managed Logstash pipeline, or update an existing pipeline

* <<logstash-configuration-management-api-retrieve, Retrieve pipeline API>> to retrieve a centrally-managed Logstash pipeline
