= Reporting from Kibana

You can generate reports that contain {kib} dashboards,
visualizations, and saved searches. The reports are exported as
print-optimized PDF documents.

NOTE: On Linux, the `libfontconfig` and `libfreetype6` packages and system
fonts are required to generate reports. If no system fonts are available,
labels are not rendered correctly in the reports.

The following Reporting button appears in the {kib} toolbar:

You can also <<automating-report-generation,generate reports automatically>>.

IMPORTANT: Reports are stored in the `.reporting-*` indices. Any user with
access to these indices has access to every report generated by all users.

To use {reporting} in a production environment,
<<securing-reporting,secure the Reporting endpoints>>.
