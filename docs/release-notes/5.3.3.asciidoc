=== Security fix
Beginning in Kibana 5.3.0, the discovery app in Kibana is vulnerable to an
cross-site scripting attack (XSS) that would allow an attacker to inject
JavaScript into other user's browsers via Elasticsearch documents. This was
made possible by the field formatters plugin API and how it handled
compiling of template values in the discover doc table.
Versions 5.3.3 and 5.4.1 include a fix for this vulnerability
by changing the binding and compilation behavior for field formatters.
Thanks to Thomas GÃ¸ytil for reporting this issue. +
