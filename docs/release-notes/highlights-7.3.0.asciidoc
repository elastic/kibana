[[maps-7.3]]
=== Maps app is now production ready

Maps is production ready for 7.3, and includes many improvements, including
a new GeoJson upload and improved layer styling, aggregations, and tooltips.
To find out more about what’s in Maps and how to use it, check out the 
https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-maps-7-3-0-released[Maps 7.3.0 release blog] and 
<<maps, documentation>>.

[float]
==== Upload GeoJSON data (beta)

Maps now makes it easier for you to get your geospatial data into the Elastic Stack. 
Use the new GeoJSON upload feature to drag and drop your point, shape files, 
and features directly into {es}, so you can use them as layers in the map.

[float]
==== More layer styling

Maps gives you more options for styling your layers. You can now select the 
color ramp for heatmap layers. You can also symbolize geo_point features with icons that you can color, size, and rotate based on property values.

[float]
==== New top hits aggregation

The new top hits aggregation enables you to plot the most recent entities from your {es} indices.

[float]
==== Better tooltip content

Maps now helps you create more in-depth tooltip content. Your tooltips can
display information on each feature at the current location.
To cycle through the features and view their properties, use the tooltip page controls. 
You can also include custom labels for Grid aggregation and join metrics. 

[float]
[[kerberos-7.3]]
=== Kerberos authentication provider

{es} provides support for Kerberos starting in 6.6, and in 7.3, 
{kib} introduces Kerberos authentication provider. You now have single sign-on 
access and can log into {kib} without repeatedly providing your username and password.  
For details, see <<kibana-authentication, SAML single sign-on>>.

[float]
[[snapshot-7.3]]
=== Snapshot phase 2: restore and delete

The second phase of the snapshot management UI is out, and includes 
two notable enhancements: restore and delete. You can recover data and state 
from a snapshot using the new *Restore* wizard, and track its progress in the 
*Restore Status* view. You can delete snapshots, and free up repository storage space,
in the *Snapshots* view.  For more information, see <<snapshot-repositories, Snapshot and Restore>>.

[float]
[[csv-export-7.3]]
=== CSV export from a saved search

{kib} now allows you to export a saved search on a dashboard directly to CSV. 
This action is available in the dashboard panel menu for the saved search. 
To enable this feature, you must set 
`xpack.reporting.csv.enablePanelActionDownload: true` in your `kibana.yml` file.

[[canvas-7.3]]
=== Canvas templates, experiences, and documentation

Canvas improves the user experience with new templates, experiences, and documentation.

[float]
==== Templates

Canvas is all about creating content and telling a story with your data. The 
content templates can help you facilitate this vision, and in 
7.3, Canvas releases three new templates:

* Pitch is a 14-page template that you can brand and customize for your 
next board-level presentation.

* The Status template gives you a professional template 
for status reports and other updates. 

* The Summary template, shown below, can help you create a report with live representations 
of your data.

[float]
==== Experiences

Canvas adds a number of experiences in 7.3: nudge, alignment, distribution, 
zoom, and fit-to-screen. Nudge enables you to more precisely align elements 
in your workpad.  Use the up, down, left, or right arrow key to nudge an 
element by 10 pixels.  To nudge an element by 1 pixel, use Shift + an arrow key.

[float]
==== Documentation

Check out the 
updated <<canvas-tutorial, Getting started guide>>, the new introduction to <<create-canvas-workpad, Canvas workpads>>, 
and the improved <<canvas-function-reference, Canvas function reference>>.

[[KQL-7.3]]
=== KQL + autocomplete in filter aggregations

In 7.0 and later, the {kib} query language (KQL) is enabled by default, 
making it easier to create queries. If you have a Basic license or above, 
autocomplete is also enabled. Starting in 7.3, {kib} expands KQL and 
autocomplete support to include filter aggregations in Visualize and 
TSVB. Just start typing, and you’ll get suggestions for fields, values 
for keyword fields, and query operators.

[[bar-charts-7.3]]
=== Values inside bar charts

You can now show values directly inside a bar chart, if space is available.  
When you create the bar chart, open Panel Settings and select *Show values on chart*.

[[visual-builder-7.3]]
=== Visual Builder: even better under a new name

Time Series Visual Builder is now simply referred to as TSVB. When you open 
TSVB, you’ll also notice several enhancements
and bug fixes.
