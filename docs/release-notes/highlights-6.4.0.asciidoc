Each release of {kib} brings new features and product improvements. 
Here are the highlights of the features that were added in 6.4.0 and 
how the user experience improved.

Refer to the <<release-notes-6.4.0, Kibana 6.4.0 Release Notes>> for a list of bug fixes and 
other changes.

=== One-click sample data

To improve the getting started experience, {kib} has a sample data 
set that enables you to take {kib} for a test ride without having to 
go through the process of loading data yourself.  With one click, 
you can install a Flight data set and start interacting with {kib} 
visualizations in seconds.

To access the sample data, go to the {kib} home page and click 
the link next to *Sample Data*.

=== Improved workflow for inspecting data

If you’ve used a spy panel in the past to inspect the data behind a 
visualization, you’ll notice that this feature has been given a facelift.  
It’s also easier to access&mdash; you can inspect visualizations 
from multiple places in the UI. On a dashboard, open the panel 
menu for a visualization and select *Inspect*.  In the visualization editor, 
click *Inspect* in the menu bar.

=== New Beta tutorials

You'll find new Beta tutorials on the *Add Data* page. The majority of these tutorials are 
for Metricbeat modules that fetch metrics from services.  These tutorials include the Beta 
label to indicate that they are a pre-release of the software.

To access the tutorials, go to the {kib} home page. In *Add Data to {kib}*, 
find the data type you’re interested in and click its button to view a 
list of available tutorials.

=== Saved Objects refresh

*Saved Objects* in *Management* has a new look. The updated page 
provides the same features in terms of filtering, importing, 
exporting, and deleting of saved objects, plus three main improvements:

* You can now import and export index patterns.
* Importing saved objects has a more user-friendly workflow.
* A new *Relationship* view allows you to view how other objects 
use an object, so you know the impact of deleting it.

=== Scripted fields preview

*Index patterns* in *Management* now allows you 
to test run a <<scripted-fields, script>> to see if your scripted fields work as intended. 
If your results require more context, you can easily include more fields in 
the test run.  

To try out this feature, open *Index patterns > Scripted fields*.  
Add or edit a scripted field and click *Get help with syntax and 
preview the results or your script*.  

Scripts are validated on save.  You can’t save a script that 
won't compile.

=== Custom rules for fine tuning machine learning results

If you want to fine tune your machine learning results 
(for example, to skip anomalies related to certain servers), 
you can now create custom rules in {kib}. Custom rules instruct 
anomaly detectors to change their behavior based on domain-specific 
knowledge that you provide. See 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/6.4/ml-rules.html[machine learning custom rules].

=== Improved usability for managing machine learning jobs

The *Machine Learning > Job Management* page has a new look, which comes with 
better searching, filtering, and multi-select options, enabling you to 
manage multiple jobs with fewer clicks.

=== Response time anomalies with machine learning in APM

The APM UI now integrates with machine learning to show anomalies in 
response times on transactions. This makes catching unexpected behavior in your 
services much easier by annotating critical anomalies on top of the response times graph. 
It’s a one-click setup in the APM UI to get the job running. 
This feature is in Beta for 6.4.

=== New query bar for searching and filtering APM data

Adding a query will instantly apply to the data shown in graphs and tables, 
making the scope of the data immediately more focused. It comes with a handy 
autocomplete that helps find the fields and even provides suggestions to 
the data they include. This way you can easily filter for transaction response 
times higher than 2000 ms, a particular user ID, or even a response status code.
This feature is in Beta for 6.4.

=== Landing page for Elastic Maps Service

The Elastic Maps Service powers all geospatial visualizations for 
{kib} by serving up basemaps tiles and vector boundary layers, 
key features that are essential for visualizing geodata. The new 
landing page allows you to preview the data that is published by 
Elastic Maps Service, either as a map or as data. 

You can do a text search for feature properties, or use your mouse 
to see the available properties for each feature. You can also use 
the landing page to download the vector data that is hosted by the 
Elastic Maps Service.

=== Experimental API docs

This release adds documentation for these experimental APIs:

* The <<role-management-api, {kib} role management API>> enables you to control 
access to {kib} features and saved objects.
* The <<logstash-configuration-management-api, Logstash configuration management API>> allows you to 
programmatically integrate with the Logstash configuration 
management feature.

{kib} also has documentation for the <<saved-objects-api, saved objects API>>,
which allows you to manage {kib} saved objects, including dashboards, visualizations, and index patterns.


[float]
=== Console enhancements

The Console has three main improvements:

* Support for new {es} APIs, including rollups. 
* Links to API documentation.  In the Console, right click the tool 
icon for an API endpoint and select *Open documentation*. 
* Improved support for autocompletion.

See the <<release-notes-6.4.0, {kib} 6.4.0 Release Notes>> for 
a complete list of improvements to the Console.
