=== Annotate your {ml} results

You can now add annotations by drag-selecting in the *Single Metric Viewer*
charts. For example, you can annotate a time period to describe what is
occurring in your operational environment or to explain why anomalies were
detected. After you add annotations, they are also listed in the
*Anomaly Explorer* and the *Job Management* page. See <<xpack-ml>>.
