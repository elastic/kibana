Each release of {kib} brings new features and product improvements. 
Here are the highlights of the feature and user experience changes in 6.6.0.

Refer to the <<release-notes-6.6.0, {kib} 6.6.0 Release Notes>> for a list of
bug fixes and other changes.

=== Support for multiple Elasticsearch nodes 

For increased stability, you can now define multiple {es} nodes for {kib}. This 
prevents {kib} from being tied to a single {es} node while allowing for the 
requests to be distributed over multiple nodes in the cluster.  Simply set 
`elasticsearch.hosts` in your kibana.yml file to the URLs of the {es} nodes you 
want to use.  You can also configure {kib} to automatically discover other nodes 
in the cluster (`elasticsearch.sniffOnStart`) or on an interval (`elasticsearch.sniffInterval`).
For more information, see {kibana-ref}/settings.html[Kibana configuration settings].

=== Index lifecycle policies (beta)

{kib} has additional *Management* user interfaces that provide a simple, 
user-friendly way to use advanced features.  This version introduces 
*Index Lifecycle Policies*.  If you use time series indices, this feature can 
help you keep your clusters tidy. You can create and manage index lifecycle policies, 
which automate actions such as rolling over an index, relocating shards to warm 
or cold nodes, merging shards, and deleting outdated indices.  
See {kibana-ref}/index-lifecycle-policies.html[Index lifecycle policies].

=== Remote clusters and Auto-follow pattern

{kib} *Management* also has two new user interfaces for cross cluster replication. 
*Remote clusters* helps you manage your remote clusters for use with cross cluster 
search and cross cluster replication. You can add and remove remote clusters 
and check their connectivity.

*Auto-follow pattern* helps you create and manage the remote replication process.  
You can follow an index pattern on the remote cluster for auto-discovery and 
then replicate new clusters that match the pattern.

=== Enhancements in Canvas (beta)

Quite a few improvements made their way into Canvas. 

Element grouping is now available&mdash;you can combine your favorite elements 
and manipulate them as one. Simply hold down the *Shift* key to select a few 
elements, and then press *G* to group them. To ungroup your grouped elements, 
press *U*.

This version also introduces the ability to copy and paste elements. You can copy 
elements between pages of your workpad and across different workpads. 

If you’re a CSS guru and enjoy styling your elements with custom CSS, you’ll 
be excited to learn that Canvas supports global CSS across your entire workpad. 

Finally, Canvas has two workpad templates to help you get started. You can 
choose between a light and a dark themed workpad. Look for the *Templates* tab on 
the Canvas home page.

=== Reporting: Export dashboard to a png
You can now export dashboards as a PNG report.  This makes it easier for you to 
share and embed your graphics in blogs, websites, and presentations. PNG 
reporting is available in the *Share* menu from the {kib} toolbar. You must have 
a https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Gold license] to use 
https://www.elastic.co/products/stack/reporting[Reporting features].

=== Upgrade Assistant for Elasticsearch 7.0

{kib}'s revised Upgrade Assistant can help you prepare for an upgrade from 
{es} 6.x to {es} 7.0. The assistant identifies issues you need to address 
before upgrading and simplifies the migration of indices that require reindexing.  
You'll find this feature in *Management > {es} > Upgrade Assistant*.

=== Annotation of {ml} results

You can now add annotations by drag-selecting in the *Single Metric Viewer*
charts. For example, you can annotate a time period to describe what is
occurring in your operational environment or to explain why anomalies were
detected. After you add annotations, they are also listed in the
*Anomaly Explorer* and the *Job Management* page. Some annotations are also
added automatically, for example when data is missing due to ingestion delays.
See <<xpack-ml>>.

=== Simplified creation of {ml} jobs for {auditbeat} data

If you use {auditbeat} to collect data about processes that are running in your
system, there are {ml} wizards that recognize this type of data. They expedite
the creation of customized jobs, dashboards, searches, and visualizations. 

For example, you can select a supplied configuration to detect unusual processes
in Docker containers:
