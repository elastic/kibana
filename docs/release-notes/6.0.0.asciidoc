Discover::
* Implement new Kibana query language {pull}12624[#12624]
  - This PR adds a new experimental query language to Kibana. The new language is turned off by default but can be enabled in the Management > Advanced Settings via the search:queryLanguage:switcher:enable option. Changing this setting to true will add a language selector to the query bar that allows users to choose the new language for their query. Details of the new query language can be found in the issue description (#12282).
* Remove highlight query {pull}13231[#13231]
* [Fixes #12635]  Improve the accessibility of the Discover screen {pull}12681[#12681]
* [Fixes #12343] Remove custom keyboard navigation in datepicker {pull}13644[#13644]

* [Accessibility] Avoid empty th in doc-table header row {pull}12364[#12364]
  - The discover document table header cells provide appropriate hints to screen-readers.
* [Accessibility] Add button to skip past the discover doc table {pull}12539[#12539]
  - The new "Skip to bottom"-button in Discover is invisible unless focused. When activated it displays all remaining rows that were already loaded and focuses an anchor located below the table.
* Timepicker on the right {pull}11980[#11980]
Management::
* [indexPatterns] remove support for time patterns {pull}12158[#12158]
  - Removes ability to create index patterns based on time patterns/intervals  - Adds a warning that informs users when they are using an index pattern that is now unsupported (disabled by default until #10442 is done, #12322)  - Does not address editing/remapping index patterns, see last task in #12242
* [Fix for #11526, #8225] Move build info from management section to status page {pull}13341[#13341]
* [Management] Provide a way to fetch indices and template index patterns {pull}12200[#12200]
* [Management] More universal solution for fetching indices and aliases {pull}12405[#12405]
* Add breadcrumb-page-title to management-app {pull}12765[#12765]
  - The bread-crumbs component allows for the consumer to pass in a page-title value which is appended as the final breadcrumb in the chain. This PR adds a scope argument to the management-app to take advantage of it.
Operations::
* Updates to status API, re-align status page {pull}10180[#10180]
* [Fix for #10181] Revert same port http -> https redirect {pull}10930[#10930]
  - Kibana 5.x redirected requests from http to https on the same port if TLS was configured. Starting in Kibana 6.0.0 Kibana no longer redirects basic http traffic to https.
* Update mappings for kibana index {pull}9280[#9280]
* Use single ES document type {pull}12794[#12794]
  - Starting in Elasticsearch 6.0, you are no longer able to create new indices with multiple index types. To accomplish the same effect as index types, a new type field was added to identify the document and the value mapped under the index to allow for strict mapping.
* [logging] Downgrade hapi connection errors when connecting with the wâ€¦ {pull}11209[#11209]
* [status] 15m load average should use the 3rd index {pull}11202[#11202]
* [Fixes #9436] [optimizer] remove support for .jsx extension {pull}12712[#12712]
* Sets ES mapping to single_type=false {pull}11451[#11451]
Platform::
* [Fix for #12012] Fail to start if settings include unknown keys {pull}12554[#12554]
  - When a config file includes invalid keys or values, Kibana usually logs a message describing the issue and fails to start. There has been an exception to this rule since 4.2 that allowed top-level keys to be unknown/misspelled and only caused a warning to be logged. That exception has been removed and now any unknown or misspelled config key passed to Kibana (via the config file or command line flags) will prevent it from starting.
* Remove the es_admin proxy {pull}13000[#13000]
* Restrict ES data proxy to msearch and search {pull}13020[#13020]
* [server/indexPatterns] expose indexPatternService getter/factory {pull}13012[#13012]
* Remove client-side management of Kibana index mappings {pull}12820[#12820]
* Uses uuid for auto-generated ids and prepends type (#12834) {pull}12877[#12877]
* [uiSettings] support defining settings with uiExports {pull}12250[#12250]
  - define a uiExports.uiSettingDefaults key your plugin definition to add uiSettingDefaults - uiSettingDefaults must be unique. If a key is already defined elsewhere then the server will not start. - defined settings will display in the advanced settings editor, along with the intended default value and description - the REST API is identical to before - the browser API is identical to before - defaults for timelion have been extracted to the timelion plugin definition and the existing defaults are defined in the kibana plugin definition
* Refactor commaList filter logic into common util {pull}12553[#12553]
* [kbnServer/extensions] formalize request factories with helper {pull}12697[#12697]
* Allow plugins to turn off the "link to last URL" navigation helper {pull}13044[#13044]
Sharing::
* Add label and clear link to color picker {pull}12422[#12422]
* Expose the variables for dynamically building doc links {pull}12513[#12513]
* Reactify stateless table components {pull}12349[#12349]
* Full screen mode implementation for dashboard {pull}12265[#12265]
  - You can now enter full screen mode when viewing a dashboard. This hides the Chrome and the top nav bar.  If you have any filters applied, you'll see the filter bar, otherwise that will be hidden as well.  To exit full screen mode, hover over and click the Kibana button on the lower left side of the page, or simple press the ESC key.
Visualize::
* Visualize Refactor {pull}11786[#11786]
  - When creating new visualizations, developers are no longer restricted to using just Angular as a rendering technology. The changes now also enables developers to create custom editors that do not conform to the current sidebar-layout. Commonly used functionality - such as access to the query bar or timefilter - is now also exposed on the visualization object. This avoids the need to import individual modules from inside Kibana. These changes are a first step in a longer term effort to provide a robust long-lived programming interface for building visualizations in Kibana.
* Replace "marked" with "markdown-it" {pull}13623[#13623]
* Upgrade kibana to leaflet 1.x {pull}12367[#12367]
* Duration Formatting for TSVB {pull}13337[#13337]
* allows more flexible timelion queries {pull}10961[#10961]
* Support multiline Timelion queries {pull}11972[#11972]
* Fix ui-select error border color and placeholder font color. {pull}12411[#12411]
* Fix appearance of error indicator in Visualize sidebar.  {pull}12410[#12410]
* [Fix for #11193] hide current time marker when the timespan doesn't include the current time {pull}12266[#12266]
  - Only display current time marker on  a visualization when the x-axis extent includes the current time.
* [Fix for #7040] Add github-markdown.css to markdown visualization {pull}12377[#12377]
* Filter geohash_grid aggregation to map view box with collar {pull}12806[#12806]
* add font size control to markdown visualization {pull}12860[#12860]
* [vis/resizeChecker] swap out implemenation with ResizeObserver polyfill {pull}9439[#9439]
* Add imports for SavedObjectRegistryProvider.register, fixing Timelion {pull}12844[#12844]
* [Fix for #7572] add polygon drawing tool {pull}11578[#11578]
  - On a coordinate map, users can now make a selection on the map by drawing a freehand polygon. Just like the earlier boundary selection, this adds a boundary filter to the filter bar.
* [Fixes #12491, #12904, #12887] Improve accessibility of visualizations {pull}13507[#13507]
* [Fixes #11856, #12888, #12900] Improve accessibility of visualization view {pull}13726[#13726]
