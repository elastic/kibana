=== Maps for geospatial analysis

beta[] {kib} has a new application built for geospatial analysis: *Maps*.  “Where” is 
a critical question for most data points, and *Maps* enables you to ask 
(and answer) meaningful questions for your location-based data. *Maps*
doubles down on geo and introduces all new features, such as support for 
multiple layers and data sources, mapping individual geo points and shapes, 
dynamic client-side styling, and global search for ad-hoc analysis. 
To get started, check out this <<maps-getting-started, Maps tutorial>>.

=== Follower indices in Cross-Cluster Replication

{es} has the ability to follow an index in cross-cluster replication (CCR), 
and {kib} supports this feature with *Add Follower Index*.  With this new UI, 
you can replicate data from existing indices, or set up local followers on 
a case-by-case basis. CCR is a https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Platinum feature]
and is ready for production use in 6.7. CCR is available through a 30-day trial license,
which you can <<managing-licenses, activate in {kib} License Management>>.

=== New actions in Index Lifecycle Management

{kib} has a number of improvements in *Index Lifecycle Management* (ILM). Building 
on the support for {ref}/frozen-indices.html[frozen indices] in {es} 6.7, {kib} 
adds the ability to freeze and 
unfreeze indices in the cold phase. Freezing an index keeps it searchable for a longer 
period and reduces the hardware requirements. {kib} also now allows you to 
{ref}/recovery-prioritization.html[set a priority for recovering an index]
after node restart. 

In 6.7, ILM officially moves out of beta and into production use.

=== Frozen indices in Index Management

{kib} has several enhancements in *Index Management* related to frozen indices  
You can now freeze and unfreeze indices from the *Manage* menu. {kib} also now
marks frozen indices, follower indices, and rollup indices with badges, 
so you can easily distinguish them at-a-glance.

=== Upgrade Assistant reintroduced

The <<upgrade-assistant, Upgrade Assistant>> available in {kib} 5.6 has been reintroduced in 6.7 to assist 
with your upgrade to {es} 7.0. The reindex feature is enhanced in two important ways. 
When you initiate a reindex through the Upgrade Assistant, the process is now 
managed in the background. You can navigate away from the page and get an 
updated status for the reindex when you return. When reindexing, {kib} also now 
fixes commonly used settings that were removed in 7.0. If 
reindexing fails, the tool reverts any changes back to the initial state.
