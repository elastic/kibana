# Kibana breaking changes [kibana-breaking-changes]
Breaking changes can impact your Elastic applications, potentially disrupting normal operations. Before you upgrade, carefully review the Kibana breaking changes and take the necessary steps to mitigate any issues.

If you are migrating from a version prior to version 9.0, you must first upgrade to the last 8.x version available. To learn how to upgrade, check out [Upgrade](docs-content://deploy-manage/upgrade.md).

% ## Next version [kibana-X.X.X-breaking-changes]

% Use the following template to add entries to this document.

% TEMPLATE START
% $$$kibana-PR_NUMBER$$$
% ::::{dropdown} Title of breaking change 
% Description of the breaking change.
% **Impact**<br> Impact of the breaking change.
% **Action**<br> Steps for mitigating impact.
% View [PR #](PR link).
% ::::
% TEMPLATE END

% 1. Copy and edit the template in the right area section of this file. Most recent entries should be at the top of the section. 
% 2. Edit the anchor ID ($$$kibana-PR_NUMBER$$$) of the template with the correct PR number to give the entry a unique URL. 
% 3. Don't hardcode the link to the new entry. Instead, make it available through the doc link service files:
%   - {kib-repo}blob/{branch}/src/platform/packages/shared/kbn-doc-links/src/get_doc_links.ts
%   - {kib-repo}blob/{branch}/src/platform/packages/shared/kbn-doc-links/src/types.ts
% 
% The entry in the main links file should look like this:
% 
% id: `${KIBANA_DOCS}breaking-changes.html#kibana-PR_NUMBER`
% 
% 4. You can then call the link from any Kibana code. For example: `href: docLinks.links.upgradeAssistant.id`
% Check https://docs.elastic.dev/docs/kibana-doc-links (internal) for more details about the Doc links service.

## 9.0.0 [kibana-900-breaking-changes]


$$$kibana-193792$$$
:::{dropdown} Access to {{kib}}'s internal APIs is blocked
Access to internal Kibana HTTP APIs is restricted from version 9.0.0. This is to ensure that HTTP API integrations with Kibana avoid unexpected breaking changes.

**Impact**<br> Any HTTP API calls to internal Kibana endpoints will fail with a 400 status code starting from version 9.0.0.

**Action**<br> **Do not integrate with internal HTTP APIs**. They may change or be removed without notice, and lead to unexpected behaviors. If you would like some capability to be exposed over an HTTP API, [create an issue](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/new/choose). We would love to discuss your use case.

**Discover and dashboards**

$$$kibana-203927$$$
::::{dropdown} Search sessions disabled by default
:name: breaking-203927

**Details**<br> Starting from version 9.0.0, search sessions are disabled by default. To view, manage, and restore search sessions, the feature needs to be explicitly re-enabled.

**Impact**<br> Search sessions will be disabled unless they are explicitly enabled in config.yml.

**Action**<br> If you would like to continue using, managing, and restoring search sessions in 9.0, you’ll need to re-enable the feature in your kibana.yml configuration file. If not, no action is necessary.

To re-enable search sessions, add the following in your config.yml:

```
data.search.sessions.enabled: true
```

::::

$$$kibana-202863$$$
::::{dropdown} Saved query privileges have been reworked
:name: breaking-202863

**Details**

Saved query privileges have been reworked to rely solely on a single global `savedQueryManagement` privilege, and eliminate app-specific overrides (e.g. implicit access with `all` privilege for Discover, Dashboard, Maps, and Visualize apps). This change simplifies the security model and ensures consistency in the saved query management UI across Kibana, but results in different handling of saved query privileges for new user roles, and minor breaking changes to the existing management UX.

**Impact**

The `savedQueryManagement` feature privilege now globally controls access to saved query management for all new user roles. Regardless of privileges for Discover, Dashboard, Maps, or Visualize, new user roles follow this behaviour:

- If `savedQueryManagement` is `none`, the user cannot see or access the saved query management UI or APIs.
- If `savedQueryManagement` is `read`, the user can load queries from the UI and access read APIs, but cannot save queries from the UI or make changes to queries through APIs.
- If `savedQueryManagement` is `all`, the user can both load and save queries from the UI and through APIs.

**Action**

Existing user roles that were previously implicitly granted access to saved queries through the dashboard, discover, visualize, or maps feature privileges will retain that access to prevent breaking changes. While no action is required for existing roles, it’s still advisable to audit relevant roles and re-save them to migrate to the latest privileges model. For new roles, ensure that the savedQueryManagement privilege is set as needed.

::::

$$$kibana-202679$$$
::::{dropdown} Removed `discover:searchFieldsFromSource` setting
:name: breaking-202679

The `discover:searchFieldsFromSource` advanced setting has been removed.

**Details**

Users can no longer configure Discover to load fields from `_source`. This is an internal optimization and should have little impact on users. View [#202679](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/202679).
::::

$$$kibana-201254$$$
::::{dropdown} Removed the legacy table in Discover
:name: breaking-201254

**Details**

It's no longer possible to use the legacy documents table in Discover. To that effect, the `doc_table:legacy` and `truncate:maxHeight` deprecated advanced settings have been removed. View [#201254]({{kib-pull}}201254).

**Impact**

This is primarily a UX change and should have little impact on Discover users.
::::

$$$kibana-202250$$$
::::{dropdown} Scripted field creation has been disabled in the Data Views management page
:name: breaking-202250

**Details**

The ability to create new scripted fields has been removed from the *Data Views* management page in 9.0. Existing scripted fields can still be edited or deleted, and the creation UI can be accessed by navigating directly to `/app/management/kibana/dataViews/dataView/{dataViewId}/create-field`, but we recommend migrating to runtime fields or ES|QL queries instead to prepare for removal.

**Impact**

It will no longer be possible to create new scripted fields directly from the *Data Views* management page.

**Action**

Migrate to runtime fields or ES|QL instead of creating new scripted fields. Existing scripted fields can still be edited or deleted.

$$$kibana-162389$$$
::::{dropdown} Removed `visualization:colorMapping` advanced setting
:name: kibana-deprecation-197802

**Details**

The `visualization:colorMapping` advanced setting for TSVB and Visualize charts has been removed. You can switch to Lens charts, which offer a more advanced, per-chart color mapping feature with enhanced configuration options. View [#162389](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/162389).

::::

**Reporting**

$$$kibana-200834$$$
:::{dropdown} Reporting uses Kibana feature privileges only to control access to reporting features
In 8.x, the default access control model was based on a built-in role called `reporting_user`, which granted access to reporting features. Since 7.13, the preferred model for controlling access to reporting features has been Kibana feature privileges, enabled by setting `xpack.reporting.roles.enabled: false` in `kibana.yml`.

In 9.0.0, the `xpack.reporting.roles.*` settings will be ignored.

**Impact**<br> The built-in `reporting_user` role is no longer deprecated and provides access to reporting features using Kibana feature privileges. This means that users that do not have privileges to use reporting will not see reporting features in the Kibana UI.

**Action**<br> Use Kibana feature privileges to control access to reporting features.

* The `reporting_user` role is still supported, but gives full access to all reporting features. We recommend creating custom roles with minimal privileges in **Stack Management > Roles**.
* The `xpack.reporting.roles.allow` setting is no longer supported. If you have a `xpack.reporting.roles.allow` value in your `kibana.yml`, you should remove this setting and assign privileges to reporting features using Kibana feature privileges.

::::

$$$kibana-199033$$$
::::{dropdown} Removed the "Download CSV" export type functionality
:name: breaking-199033

**Details**

The functionality that allowed to download a CSV export from a dashboard's saved search panel without creating a report has been removed. To export CSV data from a dashboard panel, you may use the action menu of a saved search panel in a dashboard to generate a CSV report, and download the report from a toast popup when the report has finished generating.

**Kibana security**

$$$kibana-199656$$$
:::{dropdown} Removed v1 Security endpoints
All `v1` Kibana security HTTP endpoints have been removed.

`GET /api/security/v1/logout` has been replaced by `GET /api/security/logout` `GET /api/security/v1/oidc/implicit` has been replaced by `GET /api/security/oidc/implicit` `GET /api/security/v1/oidc` has been replaced by GET `/api/security/oidc/callback` `POST /api/security/v1/oidc` has been replaced by POST `/api/security/oidc/initiate_login` `POST /api/security/v1/saml` has been replaced by POST `/api/security/saml/callback` `GET /api/security/v1/me` has been removed with no replacement.

**Impact**<br> Any HTTP API calls to the `v1` Kibana security endpoints will fail with a 404 status code starting from version 9.0.0. Third party OIDC and SAML identity providers configured with `v1` endpoints will no longer work.

**Action**<br> Update any OIDC and SAML identity providers to reference the corresponding replacement endpoint listed above. Remove references to the `/api/security/v1/me` endpoint from any automations, applications, tooling, and scripts.
