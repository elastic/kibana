=== Organize your work in Spaces

Spaces is one of our most highly requested features. Spaces allow you to organize 
your saved objects into meaningful categories.  For example, you might place all 
sales visuals in a sales space and all logging objects in a logging space.

You can create as many spaces as you need, change spaces at any time, and move 
saved objects between spaces. With security enabled, you can control which roles 
and users have access to which spaces using RBAC.

To create, edit, and delete spaces, use *Management > Spaces*.  
Or, if you prefer to create your spaces programmatically, you can use the <<spaces-api, {kib} Spaces API>>.

=== Monitor cross-cluster replication (beta)

Monitoring includes a new UI for monitoring {ref}/ccr-apis.html[cross-cluster replication] as a beta 
feature in 6.5. Cross-cluster replication gives you resiliency in case the primary 
cluster fails--a secondary cluster serves as a hot backup. With the UI, you can 
monitor how indices are replicated from one cluster to another and view detailed
information on the leader index, the following indices, and the shards.  
You’ll also get verification on whether the replication process is viable.

=== Showcase your data in Canvas (beta)

Canvas is {kib}’s new place for showcasing your data live in a pixel-perfect design. 
Starting with a blank workpad, you can create a story about your data by combining 
static content (text, images, and shapes) with data-driven elements (charts, tables, 
images, and many others).  Each dynamic element is connected to a sample data 
source by default, so you can experiment with it before connecting to your own data. 
Canvas supports multiple languages for querying Elasticsearch: es docs, SQL, and Timelion syntax. 

Canvas tools have rich styling capabilities, allowing users to change colors and 
styles of both static and dynamic elements. Canvas is designed to be usable by everyone, 
so you can tweak an element’s content and style using the UI, or go deeper and edit 
the expressions that create the element or the css styling. In short, Canvas gives 
you everything you need to showcase your live data, your way.

=== Create and manage rollup jobs

{kib} has a new Management UI for creating, starting, stopping, and deleting rollup
jobs. Rollups is a recent addition to Elasticsearch and {ref}/rollup-apis.html[APIs for creating and 
managing rollups] have been available since 6.4.  A rollup index summarizes historical 
data and stores it compactly for future analysis, so you can query, aggregate, 
and visualize this data using a fraction of the storage.  A rollup job is a periodic 
task that aggregates the data for the rollup index. To navigate to the UI, go to 
*Management*, and under *Elasticsearch*, click *Rollup Jobs*.

=== View rolled up data in visualizations (beta)

{kib} now has beta features for visualizing rolled up data. You can create index 
patterns that use rollup indices or mix rollup and raw indices to visualize all 
data together. Most visualizations support rolled up data, with the exception of 
Timelion, Visual Builder, and Vega visualizations. You can also create dashboards 
that use visualizations based on rolled up and raw data. Finally, both rolled up 
and raw data are available in Discover.

=== Manage your Beats in a central location (beta)

The Beats management UI is your one-stop shop for centrally managing your Beats 
deployments. This new UI saves you time because you no longer have to log onto the 
machine where the Beat is deployed to conduct configuration updates.  From the UI, 
you can manage the enrollment of multiple Beats and update their configurations as 
a fleet. You must have security enabled to access the Beats UI. This feature is 
initially only available for Filebeat and Metricbeat.

=== Monitor and manage your infrastructure (beta)

{kib} has two new beta features for logging and metrics use cases, Infrastructure 
and Logs, both available from the side navigation.  With Infrastructure, you can 
explore infrastructure metrics and logs for common servers, containers, and services.

Using Logs, you can stream logs in real time or scroll through historical views in 
a console-like experience

=== Distributed tracing in APM (beta)

The APM UI now supports distributed tracing as a beta feature in 6.5. Distributed 
tracing enables you to analyze and view performance throughout your microservices 
architecture by tracing all requests.  These requests range from the initial web 
request to your front-end service to queries made to your back-end services. 
This gives you a trace of how your services interact with one another and enables 
you to pinpoint bottlenecks faster.

=== Get started with two new sample data sets

{kib} has two new, one-click sample data sets tailored to the new user experience.  
If you’re interested in business analytics, install the eCommerce data set, which 
has visualizations for product-related information, such as cost, revenue, and price.  
If you’re looking to analyze website traffic, check out the web logs sample data set. 
To access the sample data, go to the {kib} home page and click *Load a data set and a {kib} dashboard*.

In addition to a traditional dashboard, each data set includes a ready-to-go
Canvas workpad for you to play with.

=== Visualize data from a log file

Machine learning features are now available for users on a Basic license. The Data 
Visualizer helps you understand the metrics and fields in your data in preparation 
for further analysis. With the new File Data Visualizer, you can upload a CSV, NDJSON, 
or log file. The File Data Visualizer uses the new File Structure API to identify 
the file format and field mappings. You can then choose to import the data into an 
Elasticsearch index. The log file import feature is experimental in 6.5, and is 
limited to files up to 100 MB in size.
