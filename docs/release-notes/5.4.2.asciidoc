=== Bug fixes
Dashboard::
* [Fix for #12121] Update dashboard based on url changes {pull}12123[#12123]
  - We fixed a bug where certain modifications made directly to the dashboard url, such as changing panel sizes and modifying the query, failed to update dashboard without a hard refresh.
Discover::
* [Fix for #11925] [context view] Use _doc for tie-breaking instead of _uid {pull}12096[#12096]
  - To avoid filling up Elasticsearch's fielddata cache by sorting on the _uid field in the context view, the field _doc is now used as a tiebreaker by default. The field to be used can now be configured using the context:tieBreakingFields advanced setting.
Visualize::
* [Fix for #11982] Fixed point series label ids {pull}12065[#12065]
* [Fix for #12000] Hid the last bucket error when switching from parent pipeline agg {pull}12066[#12066]
