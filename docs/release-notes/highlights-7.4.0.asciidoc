[[pki-7.4]]
=== Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication

Building off the success of feature controls in 7.2 and 
support for Kerberos in 7.3, {kib} 7.4 adds support for another 
highly requested authentication mechanism, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). 
With native support for PKI authentication, users are now able to log into 
{kib} using X.509 client certificates and a two-way encryption system. 
This provides new ways to authenticate {kib}--from general client certificate 
authorization to identity card access. To start using PKI in production, check out 
{kibana-ref}/kibana-authentication.html#pki-authentication[our documentation].

[[siem-gets-maps-7.4]]
=== SIEM gets maps

A geospatial perspective is especially useful for security 
events data sets. In 7.4, SIEM embeds maps directly in 
the Network interface to show common request paths between origin and 
destination sources. 
For more information, see the https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-siem-7-4-0-released[SIEM 7.4 release blog].

[[saved-queries-and-filters-7.4]]
=== Reusable saved queries and filters

Have you ever written a query in {kib} that youâ€™ve wanted to reuse? 
7.4 introduces saved queries, which
save the contents of the search bar query, filter pills, and time filter. You can now reuse your 
saved query in dashboards, visualizations, maps, and saved 
searches, and share them with other users.

[[snapshot-lifecycle-management-7.4]]
=== Snapshot lifecycle management

Adding to the *Snapshot and Restore* UI introduced in 7.2, 
{kib} has a new view
for managing snapshot lifecycle policies. The *Policies* view provides an overview  
of your snapshot status, a history of the
snapshots taken with the defined policies, and a wizard for creating a new policy.

[[outlier-detection-7.4]]
=== Outlier detection on transforms

experimental[] In 7.3, {kib} added an API that provided outlier detection analysis. In this release, 
{kib} has a new view in Machine Learning where you can create, 
manage, and view your outlier detection jobs and their results. Because the 
results are just another index, you can create some insightful visualizations and 
maps based on the outliers found in your entity-centric data.
