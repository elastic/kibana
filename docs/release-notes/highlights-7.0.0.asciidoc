=== Fresh, sleek design

Since the introduction of the https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/[Elastic UI framework] in 6.2, 
{kib} has undergone a major design revamp. This release showcases this mobile-friendly design in its 
final form. The biggest change is a persistent global header, which 
displays information related to where you are in {kib}. The side navigation 
is now collapsed by default, giving applications more horizontal space. 
Dashboards and applications also got much needed touch-ups, including a new 
default font.

=== {kib} Query Language on by default

In 6.3, {kib} introduced the
{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language (KQL)], and in 7.0.0, 
KQL is the default.  KQL offers a simplified query syntax and support for 
scripted fields. If you have a https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Basic license or above], KQL also provides 
autocomplete. If you prefer the
{kibana-ref}/lucene-query.html[Lucene query syntax], you have the option 
to turn off KQL.

=== {kib} dark theme

{kib} now supports a dark theme across the entire application. This setting is saved 
at the {kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[Spaces] level. To try out this theme, go
to *Management > Advanced settings*, flip the dark mode switch, and reload your
page. Because theming is related to Spaces, you can no longer set a dark or
light theme on an individual dashboard.

=== Responsive dashboards

experimental[] As part of the enhancements to {kib} dashboards in 7.0, we've also made the design
more responsive. If youâ€™ve ever wanted to view and interact with {kib} on the go, 
feel free to pull it up on your phone and test out this new experimental responsive layout.

=== New look for timepicker and filters

The timepicker now makes it easier to deal with complex date queries, such as 
mixing relative times with absolute ones.

Filters are enhanced in two ways.  Each filter now comes with its own menu to 
clearly label its actions. You can also now work with filters in bulk and 
apply them from your dashboards and saved searches.

=== Saved objects aware of each other

The <<breaking-changes-7.0-saved-objects,structure of saved objects changed>> so they are now aware of each other.  
This means you can now export a dashboard,
including all visualization dependencies, from the Saved objects page. 
You can also easily move objects from one {kib} instance to another or 
between Spaces.

=== Canvas improvements

Canvas has two notable improvements: an expandable expression editor and 
additional keyboard shortcuts. 

To maximize or minimize the expression editor, 
use the expand button image:images/highlights-7.0.0-expand.png[]
in the top right corner of the editor. To adjust the font size, use the slider 
at the bottom.

Canvas has additional keyboard shortcuts for moving elements to the front and 
back and for copying your elements. To discover all shortcuts available in Canvas, 
click the help icon.
