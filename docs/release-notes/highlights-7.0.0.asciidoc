=== Fresh, sleek design

Since the introduction of the https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/[Elastic UI framework] in 6.2, 
{kib} has undergone a major design revamp. This release showcases a lighter, more 
minimal design that brings it all together. The biggest change is a persistent global header, which 
displays information related to where you are in {kib}. The side navigation 
is now collapsed by default, giving applications more horizontal space. 
Dashboards and most of the {kib} applications also got much needed touch-ups. 
Finally, the font changed to https://rsms.me/inter/[Inter UI], which is closer to 
more modern system fonts found on your OS of choice.

=== {kib} Query Language on by default

In 6.3, {kib} introduced the
{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[Kibana Query Language (KQL)], and in 7.0.0, 
KQL is the default.  KQL offers a simplified query syntax and support for 
scripted fields. If you have a https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Basic license]
(the default distribution) or above, KQL also provides 
autocomplete. If you prefer the
{kibana-ref}/lucene-query.html[Lucene query syntax], you have the option 
to turn off KQL.

=== {kib} dark theme

{kib} now supports a dark theme across the entire application. To try out this theme, go
to *Management > Advanced settings*, flip the dark mode switch, and reload your
page. Because theme selection is saved at the {kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[Spaces] level, 
you can no longer set a dark or light theme on an individual dashboard.

=== Responsive dashboards

experimental[] As part of the enhancements to {kib} dashboards in 7.0, 
the design is
more responsive. If you want to view and interact with {kib} on the go, 
pull it up on your phone and test out this new, experimental responsive layout.

=== New look for timepicker and filters

The timepicker now makes it easier to deal with complex date queries.  For example,
you can mix relative times with absolute ones. The timepicker design is also improved.
The control no longer pushes the content down the page as you interact 
with it. The design is also more compact, which is necessary 
to make it work better on mobile dashboards.

Filters are enhanced in two ways.  Each filter now provides a dropdown menu 
that clearly defines the actions you can take on the filter. Thereâ€™s also a 
new menu for dealing with filters in bulk.

=== Saved objects structure improvements

The {kibana-ref}/breaking-changes-7.0.html#breaking-changes-7.0-saved-objects[structure of saved objects changed],
so that they are now aware of each other.  
This means you can now export a dashboard, including all visualization dependencies, 
from the Saved objects page. 
You can also easily move objects from one {kib} instance to another or 
between Spaces.

[float]
=== Canvas enhancements

Canvas has two notable improvements: an expandable expression editor and 
additional keyboard shortcuts. 

To maximize or minimize the expression editor, 
use the expand button image:images/highlights-7.0.0-expand.png[]
in the top right corner of the editor. To adjust the font size, use the slider 
at the bottom.

Canvas has more keyboard shortcuts for moving elements to the front and 
back and for copying your elements. To discover all shortcuts available in Canvas, 
click the help icon.
