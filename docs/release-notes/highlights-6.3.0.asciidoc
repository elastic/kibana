Each release of {kib} brings new features and product improvements. Here are the 
highlights of the features that were added in 6.3 and how the user experience 
improved.

Refer to the <<release-notes-6.3.0, {kib} 6.3 Release Notes>> for a list bug 
fixes and other changes.

=== License management and {xpack} code

Starting with version 6.3, all of the free {xpack} features, such as monitoring, 
CSV exports, Search Profiler, Grok Debugger, and dedicated APM UIs, 
ship with the default distribution of {kib}.  When you install {kib}, it 
generates a Basic license with no expiration date.

You can view the status of your license, update your license, or start a 30-day 
trial of https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Platinum features] in 
*Management > License Management*. The trial enables you to try out features 
such as security, machine learning, alerting, graph capabilities, and more.

For more information, see <<managing-licenses>>.

=== Autocomplete in the query bar

{kib}'s experimental autocomplete and simple syntax features can help you 
create queries. To turn these features on, click *Options* on the right of the 
query bar and opt in. Once enabled, just start typing in the query bar, and 
you'll get suggestions for fields, values for keyword fields, and query operators.

=== Return to recently viewed content

{kib} now keeps track of your recently viewed items so that you can easily get 
back to them.  Here's how:

* Your last five recently viewed items are listed at the top of the home page. 
A dropdown menu provides access to views further back in history.

* Your recently selected time ranges are listed in the Recent tab in the time 
picker.


[float]
=== Smaller grid dimensions for dashboards

{kib} 6.3 gives you more control over panel sizes when creating a dashboard.  
This gives you better control over the layout.  Here are the changes:

* The grid height of the dashboard was decreased from 100 pixels to 20 pixels.

* The number of columns in the grid was increased from 12 to 48.


[float]
=== Chained input controls

The <<controls, Controls visualization>> now enables you to chain dropdown menus.
When chained, the value selected in the first menu filters the terms in the second 
menu. A chained menu is only enabled when its ancestor controls have values.

[float]
=== Index Management UI

The new <<managing-indices,Index management>> UI enables you to view index 
settings, mappings, and statistics and perform management operations. These 
include refreshing, flushing, clearing the cache, merging segments, and closing 
or deleting indices. The UI provides a convenient way to perform bulk operations
on multiple indices.

=== Interactive map support in Vega

You can now use <<vega-graph, Vega graphs>> to overlay a  geographic data visualization 
on a map.  To start a Vega visualization, open the Visualization application and
click the *+* button. Scroll to the *Others* section and select *Vega*.

[float]
=== Easily enable monitoring from the UI

In 6.3, the first time you open {kib} monitoring, data collection is disabled,
and you are prompted to turn it on. If you have permission to turn on data 
collection, and there is data in the cluster, {kib} displays the monitoring
dashboards. If {kib} can't activate monitoring, you'll get a message with 
suggestions to try.

[float]
=== Enhancements to the Console

The autocompletion feature in the Dev Tools Console is now expanded to use all 
{kib} and Basic {xpack} APIs.  

[float]
=== APM Watcher Assistant

The new *Watcher assistant* UI enables you to easily generate watches that alert 
you to errors in your APM data. You can specify an error group occurrence threshold
and a trigger schedule. At a fixed interval (minutes/hours/daily), you will get
an email or slack notification if an error group has more than the specified 
number of occurrences.

[float]
=== Job validation

There is now an option in the {ml} job creation wizards to validate your choices
before you create the job. The wizards provide advice based on your settings and 
the characteristics of your data. For example, you might be advised to reconsider 
your bucket span or choice of influencers. By heeding these suggestions, you can 
create jobs that are more likely to produce insightful machine learning results. 
For more information, see <<job-tips>>.

[float]
=== Custom URL improvements

The inclusion of custom URLs in your {ml} jobs enables users to follow links 
from the anomalies table in the *Anomaly Explorer* and the *Single Metric Viewer* 
to your URL of choice. For example, you could create a link to an operational 
dashboard that provides contextual information to help explain the anomaly. The 
custom URL can include targeted date ranges and optional query parameters as 
string substitutions.  As a result, custom URLs have been challenging to create. 
In 6.3, when you edit your job in {kib}, there are new custom URL options to 
help you create a link to the *Discover* page, new controls for configuring the 
time range of the target page, and a button to test the URL.
