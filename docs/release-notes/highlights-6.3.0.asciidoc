coming[6.3.0]

Each release of {kib} brings new features and product improvements.
Here are the highlights of the features that were added in 6.3 and
how the user experience improved.

Refer to the <<release-notes-6.3.0,6.3.0 Release Notes>> for a list bug
fixes and other changes.

[float]
=== License management and {xpack} code

Starting with version 6.3, all of the free {xpack} features, such
as monitoring, tile maps, Grok Debugger, and Search Profiler,
ship with the default distribution of {kib}.  When you install {kib},
it generates a Basic license with no expiration date.

You can view the status of your license, install a new license,
or start a 30-day trial of https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Platinum features]
in *Management > License Management*.
The trial enables you to try out features such as
security, machine learning, alerting,
graph capabilities,
and more.

At the end of the trial period, your license reverts to a Basic license.
To continue using the Platinum features, you can purchase a
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription] and update
you license.

=== Autocomplete and simple syntax

{kib}'s experimental autocomplete and simple syntax features
can help you create queries. To turn on these features,
click *Options* on the right of the query bar
and opt in.

Once enabled, just start typing in the query bar,
and you'll get suggestions for fields,
values for keyword fields, and query operators.
For information on the simplified, easier-to-use syntax, see
<<kuery-query, {kib} Query Language Enhancements>>.



[float]
=== Return to recently viewed content

{kib} now keeps track of your recently viewed
items so that you can easily get back to them.  Here's how:

* Your last five recently viewed items are listed
at the top of the Home page. A dropdown menu
provides access to views further back in
history.

* Your recently selected time ranges are listed
in the Recent tab in the time picker.


[float]
=== Smaller grid dimensions for dashboards

{kib} 6.3 gives you more control over panel sizes when
creating a dashboard.  This gives you better control over
the layout.  Here are the changes:

* The grid height of the dashboard was decreased from 100 pixels to 20
pixels.

* The number of columns in the grid was increased from 12 pixels to
48 pixels.


[float]
=== Chained Input Controls

The <<controls,Controls>> visualization now enables you to chain dropdown menus.
When chained, the value selected in the first menu
filters the terms in the second menu. A chained menu
is only enabled when its ancestor controls have values.

[float]
=== Index Management UI

The new <<managing-indices,Index management>> UI enables you to view index settings, mappings,
and statistics and perform management operations. These include refreshing,
flushing, clearing the cache, merging segments, and closing or deleting indices.
The UI provides a convenient way to perform bulk operations on multiple indices.

[float]
=== Interactive map support in Vega

You can now use the <<vega-graph, Vega visualization plugin>> to overlay
a geographic data visualization on a map.  To start a Vega visualization,
open the Visualization application and click the *+* button. Scroll to the
*Others* section and select *Vega*.

[float]
=== Easily enable monitoring from the UI

In 6.3, the first time you open {kib} monitoring, data collection is disabled,
and you'll be prompted to turn it on. If you have permission to turn
on data collection, and there is data in the cluster, {kib} displays the
monitoring dashboards. If {kib} can't activate monitoring, you'll get a message
with suggestions to try.

[float]
=== Enhancements to the console

The autocomplete function in the Dev tools console
is now expanded to use {kib} and Basic {xpack} APIs.
This ensures that autocomplete covers the same use cases as the query bar
and other areas of {kib}.

[float]
=== APM Watcher Assistant

The new *Watcher assistant* UI enables
you to easily generate watches that alert you to errors in
your APM data. You can specify an error group occurrence threshold
and a trigger schedule. At a fixed interval (minutes/hours/daily),
you will get an email or slack notification if
an error group has more than the specified number of occurrences.
