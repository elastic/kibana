For the Elastic Security 9.3.0 release information, refer to [Elastic Security Solution Release Notes](docs-content://release-notes/elastic-security/index.md).

**Kibana platform**:

* Fixes an issue in the component template creation flow where a new component template with `@custom` suffix in its name would lead to updating mappings of all unrelated data streams and cause a popup to appear asking to roll over conflicting ones [#237952]({{kib-pull}}237952).
* Fixes privilege requirements when reindexing indices through the upgrade assistant. Previously, the "superuser" role was required. Now, "cluster: manage" and "all" privileges for the relevant indices are sufficient [#237055]({{kib-pull}}237055).

* Fixes an issue where the retriever query copied from the "Search your data" JavaScript tutorial fails with a `parsing_exception` when passed through the query parameter in the Node.js Elasticsearch client. Retriever queries must be passed through the body parameter to ensure they are serialized correctly [#237654]({{kib-pull}}237654).
