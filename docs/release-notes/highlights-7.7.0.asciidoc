a| *New alerting framework*

Alerting allows you to detect complex conditions in
{kib} apps and trigger actions when those conditions are met.
Alerting is integrated with <<xpack-apm,APM>>, <<xpack-infra,Metrics>>,
<<xpack-siem,SIEM>>, and <<xpack-uptime,Uptime>> and is
centrally managed from <<management, Management>>.
Alerting has built-in <<action-types, actions>> and
<<alert-types, alerts>> for you to use.

a| *Canvas with your visualizations*

Visualizations that you created in Lens, Visualize, and
TSVB can now be part of a Canvas workpad. This makes it easier for you
to brand your Canvas presentation to your executive team and partners.

a| *Better Lens filtering in dashboards*

Digging into the Lens visualizations in your
dashboard just got faster. You can now filter the data in one
Lens visualization, and immediately apply that filter to all
Lens visualizations on the same dashboard.

a| *Number formatting in Lens*

To more accurately display the data in Lens visualizations,
try out the new number formats. You can format numbers as percentages
or bytes and customize the placement of the decimal point.

a| *Indivual map points on zoom*

By default, a map now shows an
aggregation of data points when your viewing
area has more than 10,000 discrete points.  When you pan or zoom to an area
with less than 10,000 points, you'll see
individual points. This feature is useful for map data
points that are in both dense urban areas and rural locations.

a| *Distance filters in maps*

The distance filter is a new way
to filter for map data
within a specific radius.  Simply select a
central location, and then draw a circle around it with your mouse.
The distance filter is in addition to filtering by custom shape or rectangular bound.

a| *Extension to query timeout*

You can now opt to extend a query to run pasts its hard timeout.
For example, when a dashboard query time is close
to timing out, you're asked it you want to  run it to completion.

a| *Multiple SSO options*

{kib} now gives you multiple SSO authentication methods,
so you can configure the sign-on experience that is best for
your organization and users.
