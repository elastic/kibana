Lens visualization, and immediately apply that filter to all
Lens visualizations on the dashboard.

[[lens-formatting-highlights]]

[[map-points-highlights]]
=== Individual map points on zoom

*Elastic Maps* improves the way you work with large amounts of coordinate data.
With the new default setting, points are clustered on a map until you zoom into an area with
less than 10,000 discrete points.  Then, you'll see
individual points. This feature is useful for map data
points that are in both dense urban areas and rural locations.

[[map-distance-filter-highlights]]
=== Distance filters in Elastic Maps

The distance filter is a new way
to filter map data
within a specific radius.  Simply select a
central location, and then draw a circle around it with your mouse.
The distance filter is in addition to the tools for filtering data by custom shape and by rectangular bound.
