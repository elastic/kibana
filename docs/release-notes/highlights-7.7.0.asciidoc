a| *New alerting framework*

Alerting allows you to detect complex conditions in
{kib} apps and trigger actions when those conditions are met.
Alerting is integrated with <<xpack-apm,APM>>, <<xpack-infra,Metrics>>,
<<xpack-siem,SIEM>>, and <<xpack-uptime,Uptime>> and is
centrally managed from <<management, Management>>.
Alerting has built-in <<action-types, actions>> and
<<alert-types, alerts>> for you to use.

a| *Canvas with your visualizations*

Visualizations that you created in Lens, Visualize, and
TSVB can now be part of your Canvas workpad. This makes it easier for you
to create a branded version of your dashboard
to present to your peers.

a| *Lens filtering in dashboards*

To make dashboards even more interactive,
you can now filter Lens visualizations with a single click.
This gets you to the answers you're looking for, faster.

a| *Value formatting in Lens*

Lens helps you more accurately display the data you
are analyzing by enabling you to format values. You can
format numbers as percentage and bytes and include a decimal point.

a| *Distance filters in Elastic Maps*

You can now filter points in your map by selecting a
center location and then drawing a distance radius with your mouse.  This
addresses a common use case&mdash;using the map tiles underneath a data layer
as a visual reference for what location points to keep.

a| *Blended layers in Elastic Maps*

Blended layers are good for working with large amounts of data.
Toggle a setting, and your map will show an
aggregated cluster of data points when your viewing
area has more than 10,000 discrete points.  This is useful anytime you map data
points are in both dense urban areas and more rural locations.
