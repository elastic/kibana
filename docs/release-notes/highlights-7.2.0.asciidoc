=== Feature controls

Want to hide Dev Tools from the left navigation? Show Stack Monitoring only to 
admins? Or, give certain users access to only Dashboard and Canvas? 
<<kibana-role-management, Feature controls>> allow you to hide and 
restrict applications and features in the {kib} UI.

You can configure {kib} applications and features based on your users’ needs, 
and when used with security, based on their privileges. This means different 
roles can have access to different features in the same space. Power users 
might have privileges to create and edit visualizations and dashboards, 
while analysts or executives might have Dashboard and Canvas with 
read-only privileges.

=== Saved Object Import and Export API

{kib} has new APIs for <<saved-objects-api-import, importing>> and 
<<saved-objects-api-export, exporting>> saved objects, including dashboards, 
visualizations, index patterns, maps, Canvas workpads, and advanced settings. 
A benefit of this new API is that it automatically exports the dependencies 
of the saved object. Just export the dashboard you need and its visualizations 
and index patterns are exported as well. You can use the new APIs in the Management UI, 
or call them directly.

=== Rolled up data in Time Series Visual Builder 

Time Series Visual Builder now has features for visualizing rolled up data. Similar 
to Visualize, you can create index patterns that use rollup indices or mix rollup 
and raw indices to visualize all data together. You can also create multiple 
y-axes with different index patterns or rollup indices in the same chart. 

When you specify the index in Visual Builder, you must explicitly state the 
rollup name. Visual Builder will not include a rollup index if you use a wildcard. 
See https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/28762[PR #28762] 
for details.

=== Canvas enhancements 

Canvas provides enhancements to custom elements, workpad filtering, and autoplay.

[float]
==== Custom elements

Elements, such as charts, metrics, shapes, and images, are the building blocks 
of a Canvas workpad. You can combine these elements to create new and interesting 
presentations of your data. Your custom element might be as simple as a metric 
on top of a geometric shape. Or, you might create a more complex grouping backed 
by queries and conditional statements. 

With 7.2, you can save custom elements for reuse across your workpads. This 
reduces the need for copy and paste. It also enables you to share your custom 
elements with your teammates.

image::release-notes/images/7.2-canvas-custom-elements.png[Canvas custom elements]

[float]
==== Filter groups

If you’ve used the time or dropdown filter elements in Canvas, you know that 
they apply to the entire workpad (and not just the page they are in). This 
behavior is still the default, but you can now choose which elements are 
affected by specific filters.  This gives you more options for exploring data 
visualizations.

[role="screenshot"]
image::release-notes/images/7.2-canvas-filters.png[Canvas custom elements]

[float]
==== Autoplay

As part of the ongoing work to provide kiosk mode in Canvas, version 7.2 
introduces the ability to autoplay your workpad pages. Once enabled, full screen 
mode automatically cycles through your workpad pages based on the time interval 
you define.

[float]
=== Snapshot repositories

This release introduces phase one of the {kib} Snapshot UI for managing backups 
of your {es} indices and clusters. Snapshots are important because they provide 
a copy of your data in case something goes wrong. If you need to roll back to an 
older version of your data, you can restore a snapshot from the repository.  

Use the Snapshot UI to register new repositories, edit existing ones, and drill down into 
details about your repositories and snapshots. See <<snapshot-repositories, Snapshot repositories>>
for step-by-step instructions.  Additional snapshot and recovery features are 
planned for upcoming versions.

[float]
=== Maps in dashboards and other improvements 

beta[]The Maps app now adds the ability to include your saved map on a 
dashboard. You can view and interact with your geospatial data alongside 
bar charts, pie charts, and other visualizations. Click the map to 
quickly hone in on the data you desire, and that data is shown across the dashboard, 
similar to how you interact with other visualization types. See 
<<maps-embedding, Adding a map to a dashboard>> for step-by-step instructions.

[role="screenshot"]
image::release-notes/images/7.2-maps.png[Embedded map in dark mode]

Additional improvements to the new Maps app include:

* *Dark mode.* Building on the support for dark mode in {kib} 7.0, the 
Elastic Maps Service now publishes dark themed tiles. This means that the 
Maps app now fully respects dark mode.

* *Collapsible map legends.* Use this feature to get an unobstructed 
view of a map in a dashboard.  

* *Class styling.*  With this style, you can symbolize map features by class. 
Use layer filtering to define the class for each layer, and static styling to 
symbolize each class. See <<maps-vector-style-class>> for an example.

=== {kib} in Japanese

{kib} now supports Japanese, in addition to Simplified Chinese and English. 
If you’d like to use {kib} with Japanese, set `i18n.locale` to `ja-JP` in your 
`kibana.yml` file.  The Japanese localization is a work in progress. 
We welcome your feedback in the form of a https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues[Github issue]. 
You can also https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pulls[issue a pull request in GitHub].

=== {dataframes-cap}

beta[] Machine Learning now enables you to transform your data with
{ref}/transforms.html[{dataframes}]. A 
new wizard guides you through the process of creating a {dataframe}: selecting 
the source data, the fields you want to group by, and the aggregations for 
pivoting the data. There is also a preview of the transform for reviewing the configuration. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::release-notes/images/7.2-data-frames.png[{dataframes-cap}]

{transforms-cap} are managed on a new list page, displaying the details and 
status of each {tranform}, and controls for starting, stopping, or deleting {transforms}.

[float]
=== Search for influencers in Anomaly Explorer

A query bar is now available in the Machine Learning Anomaly Explorer, which 
enables you to filter anomaly results for one or more selected influencers. 
The query bar suggests influencer field names and values for the selected jobs 
as you type.

[float]
=== Simplified creation of {ml} jobs for sample data sets and {metricbeat} data

If you use the {kib} sample data sets, there are now {ml} jobs for the
sample eCommerce orders and the sample web logs. These jobs demonstrate a
variety of ways that you can detect anomalous behavior in the sample data. You
can add the jobs when you <<add-sample-data,load the sample data>> or use the
supplied configuration when you are creating jobs in the Machine Learning app.

Likewise, if you use the
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-system.html[{metricbeat} system module] to
monitor your servers, there is a {ml} wizard that recognizes this type of data.
For example, with the supplied configuration you can detect unusual increases in
disk utilization:

[role="screenshot"]
image::release-notes/images/7.2-metricbeat-ml-modules.png[Embedded map in dark mode]

These wizards expedite the creation of pre-configured jobs, dashboards, searches,
and visualizations. For more information, see <<ml-jobs>>.

[float]
=== View recent log entries alongside your monitoring data

You can now see your cluster's recent log entries within the *Stack Monitoring*
application:

[role="screenshot"]
image::release-notes/images/7.2-monitoring-logs.png["Monitoring recent {es} logs"]

See <<elasticsearch-metrics>>. If you want to see earlier log entries, you can
follow a link to the <<xpack-logs,Logs UI>> and continue your investigation
there.

TIP: You must use {filebeat} to collect the logs.

//See {ref}/configuring-filebeat.html[Collecting {es} log data with {filebeat}].

[float]
=== Observability

Observability has two new notable features.

* Metrics Explorer is a new view in the Infrastructure app. Metrics Explorer 
enhances how you interact with infrastructure metrics in an ad hoc way.

* APM agents now collect language-specific metrics, in addition to the common 
key performance indicators. These new metrics are automatically displayed in the APM UI.
