[[organize-in-spaces]]
==== Collect related items in a space

{kib} <<xpack-spaces, Spaces>> is built for organizing your visualizations, dashboards, and {data-sources}.
Think of a space as its own mini {kib} installation&mdash;it’s isolated from all other spaces,
so you can tailor it to your specific needs without impacting others.

Most of {kib}’s entities are space-aware, including dashboards, visualizations, index patterns,
*Canvas* workpads, graphs, tags, and machine learning jobs.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/select-your-space.png[Space selector view]

{kib} creates a default space for you.
After you create your own
spaces, you're asked to choose a space when you log in to {kib}. You can change your
current space at any time by using the menu.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/change-space.png["Change current space menu"]

[float]
==== Required privileges

The `kibana_admin` role or equivalent is required to manage **Spaces**.

TIP: Looking to support multiple tenants? Refer to <<xpack-security-multiple-tenants, the Security documentation>> for more information.

[float]
[[spaces-managing]]
=== View, create, and delete spaces

Open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Spaces* for an overview of your spaces.  This view provides actions
for you to create, edit, and delete spaces.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/space-management.png["Space management"]

[float]
==== Create or edit a space

You can create as many spaces as you like. Click *Create a space* and provide a name,
URL identifier, optional description.

The URL identifier is a short text string that becomes part of the
{kib} URL when you are inside that space. {kib} suggests a URL identifier based
on the name of your space, but you can customize the identifier to your liking.
You cannot change the space identifier once you create the space.

{kib} also has an <<spaces-api, API>>
if you prefer to create spaces programmatically.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/edit-space.png["Space management"]

[float]
==== Delete a space

Deleting a space permanently removes the space and all of its contents.
Find the space on the *Spaces* overview page and click the trash icon in the Actions column.
You can't delete the default space, but you can customize it to your liking.

[float]
[[spaces-control-feature-visibility]]
=== Control feature access based on user needs

You have control over which features are visible in each space.
For example, you might hide *Dev Tools*
in your "Executive" space or show *Stack Monitoring* only in your "Admin" space.
You can define which features to show or hide when you add or edit a space.

Controlling feature
visibility is not a security feature. To secure access
to specific features on a per-user basis, you must configure
<<xpack-security-authorization, {kib} Security>>.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/edit-space-feature-visibility.png["Controlling features visibility"]

[float]
[[spaces-control-user-access]]
=== Control feature access based on user privileges

When using {kib} with security, you can configure applications and features
based on your users’ privileges. This means different roles can have access
to different features in the same space.
Power users might have privileges to create and edit visualizations and dashboards,
while analysts or executives might have read-only privileges for *Dashboard* and *Canvas*.
Refer to <<adding_kibana_privileges>> for details.

[float]
[[spaces-moving-objects]]
=== Move saved objects between spaces

To move saved objects between spaces, you can <<managing-saved-objects-copy-to-space, copy objects>>, or <<managing-saved-objects-export-objects, export and import objects>>.

[float]
[[spaces-default-route]]
=== Configure a space-level landing page

You can create a custom experience for users by configuring the {kib} landing page on a per-space basis.
The landing page can route users to a specific dashboard, application, or saved object as they enter each space.

To configure the landing page, use the default route setting in
<<kibana-general-settings, Stack Management > {kib} > Advanced settings>>.
For example, you might set the default route to `/app/dashboards`.

[role="screenshot"]

[float]
[[spaces-delete-started]]
=== Disabling spaces

Starting in {kib} 8.0, the Spaces feature cannot be disabled.






[float]
[[organize-content-by-categories]]
== Organize content by tags

Tags are keywords or labels that you assign to {kib} saved objects,
such as dashboards and visualizations, so you can classify them in a way that is meaningful to you.
For example, if you tag objects with “design”, you can search and
filter on the tag to see related objects.
Tags are also good for grouping content into categories within a space.

Don’t worry if you have hundreds of dashboards that need to be tagged.

Tags enable you to categorize your saved objects.
You can then filter for related objects based on shared tags.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/tags/tag-management-section.png[Tags management]

[float]
=== Required permissions

To create tags, you must meet the minimum requirements.

* Access to *Tags* requires the `Tag Management` Kibana privilege. To add the privilege, open the main menu,
and then click *Stack Management > Roles*.
* The `read` privilege allows you to assign tags to the saved objects for which you have write permission.
* The `write` privilege enables you to create, edit, and delete tags.

NOTE: Having the `Tag Management` {kib} privilege is not required to
view tags assigned on objects you have `read` access to, or to filter objects by tags
from the global search.

[float]
[[settings-create-tag]]
=== Create a tag

Create a tag to assign to your saved objects.

. Open the main menu, and then click *Stack Management > Tags*.
. Click *Create tag*.

. Enter a name and select a color for the new tag.
+
The name cannot be longer than 50 characters.
. Click *Create tag*.

[float]
[[settings-assign-tag]]
=== Assign a tag to an object

To assign and remove tags from saved objects, you must have `write` permission
on the objects to which you assign the tags.

. In the *Tags* view, find the tag you want to assign.
. Click the action menu (...) in the tag row,
and then select the *Manage assignments* action.

. Select the objects to which you want to assign or remove tags.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/tags/manage-assignments-flyout.png[Assign flyout]

. Click *Save tag assignments*.

TIP: To assign, delete, or clear multiple tags at once,
select their checkboxes in the *Tags* view, and then select
the desired action from the *selected tags* menu.

[float]
[[settings-delete-tag]]
=== Delete a tag

When you delete a tag, you remove it from all saved objects that use it.

. Click the action menu (...) in the tag row, and then select the *Delete* action.

. Click *Delete tag*.







[float]
[[manage-saved-objects]]
== Manage saved objects

The *Saved Objects* UI helps you keep track of and manage your saved objects. These objects
store data for later use, including dashboards, visualizations, maps, data views,
Canvas workpads, and more.

To get started, open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Saved Objects*.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/management-saved-objects.png[Saved Objects]

[float]
=== Required permissions

The `Saved Objects Management` {kib} privilege is required to access the *Saved Objects* UI.

To add the privilege, open the menu, then click *Stack Management > Roles*.

NOTE:
Granting access to Saved Objects Management will authorize users to manage all saved objects in {kib}, including objects that are managed by applications they may not otherwise be authorized to access.

[float]
[[managing-saved-objects-view]]
=== View, edit, and delete

* To view and edit an object in its associated application, click the object title.

* To show objects that use this object, so you know the
impact of deleting it, click the actions icon image:images/actions_icon.png[Actions icon]
and select *Relationships*.

* To delete one or more objects, select their checkboxes, and then click *Delete*.

[float]
[[managing-saved-objects-export-objects]]
=== Import and export

Using the import and export actions, you can move objects between different
{kib} instances. This action is useful when you
have multiple environments for development and production.
Import and export also work well when you have a large number
of objects to update and want to batch the process.

In addition to the user interface, {kib} provides beta <<saved-objects-api-import, import>> and <<saved-objects-api-export, export>> APIs if
you want to automate this process.

[float]
==== Compatibility across versions

With each release, {kib} introduces changes to the way saved objects are stored. When importing a saved object, {kib} will run the necessary migrations to ensure that the imported saved objects are compatible with the current version.

However, saved objects can only be imported into the same version, a newer minor on the same major, or the next major. Exported saved objects are not backwards compatible and cannot be imported into an older version of {kib}. See the table below for compatibility examples:

|=======
| Exporting version | Importing version | Compatible?
| 6.7.0 | 6.8.1 | Yes
| 6.8.1 | 7.3.0 | Yes
| 7.3.0 | 7.11.1 | Yes
| 7.11.1 | 7.6.0 | No
| 6.8.1 | 8.0.0 | No
|=======

[float]
==== Import

You can import multiple objects in a single operation. Click *Import* and
navigate to the NDJSON file that
represents the objects to import.  By default,
saved objects already in {kib} are overwritten.

NOTE: The <<savedObjects-maxImportExportSize, `savedObjects.maxImportExportSize`>> configuration setting
limits the number of saved objects which may be included in this file. Similarly, the
<<savedObjects-maxImportPayloadBytes, `savedObjects.maxImportPayloadBytes`>> setting limits the overall
size of the file that can be imported.


[float]
==== Export

You have two options for exporting saved objects.

* Select the checkboxes of objects that you want to export, and then click *Export*.
* Click *Export x objects*, and export objects by type.

This action creates an NDJSON with all your saved objects. By default, the NDJSON includes child objects that are related to the saved
objects. Exported dashboards include their associated data views.

NOTE: The <<savedObjects-maxImportExportSize, `savedObjects.maxImportExportSize`>> configuration setting
limits the number of saved objects which may be exported.


[float]
[role="xpack"]
[[managing-saved-objects-copy-to-space]]
=== Copy to other {kib} spaces

To copy a saved object to another space, click the actions icon image:images/actions_icon.png[Actions icon]
and select *Copy to space*. From here, you can select the spaces in which to copy the object.
You can also select whether to automatically overwrite any conflicts in the target spaces, or
resolve them manually.

WARNING: The copy operation automatically includes child objects that are related to the saved objects. If you don't want this behavior, use
the <<spaces-api-copy-saved-objects, copy saved objects to space API>> instead.


[float]
[[managing-saved-objects-object-definition]]
=== Advanced editing

Some objects offer an advanced *Edit* page for modifying the object definition.
To open the page, click the actions icon image:images/actions_icon.png[Actions icon]
and select *Inspect*.
You can change the object title, add a description, and modify
the JSON that defines the object properties.

If you access an object whose index has been deleted, you can:

* Recreate the index so you can continue using the object.
* Delete the object and recreate it using a different index.
* Change the index name in the object's `reference` array to point to an existing
data view. This is useful if the index you were working with has been renamed.

WARNING: Validation is not performed for object properties. Submitting an invalid
change will render the object unusable. A more failsafe approach is to use
*Discover* or *Dashboard* to create new objects instead of
directly editing an existing one.






[float]
[[customize-kibana]]
== Customize {kib}

*Advanced Settings* control the behavior of {kib}. For example, you can change the format used to display dates,
specify the default data view, and set the precision for displayed decimal values.

. Open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Advanced Settings*.
. Scroll or search for the setting.
. Make your change, then click *Save changes*.

[float]
=== Required permissions

The `Advanced Settings` {kib} privilege is required to access *Advanced Settings*.

When you have insufficient privileges to edit advanced settings, the edit options are not visible, and the following
indicator is displayed:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/settings-read-only-badge.png[Example of Advanced Settings Management's read only access indicator in Kibana's header]

To add the privilege, open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Roles*.

For more information on granting access to {kib}, refer to <<xpack-security-authorization>>.

WARNING: Changing a setting can affect {kib} performance and cause problems
that are difficult to diagnose. Setting a property value to a blank field
reverts to the default behavior, which might not be compatible with other
configuration settings. Deleting a custom setting permanently removes it from {kib}.
