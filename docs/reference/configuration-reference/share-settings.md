# Share settings in {{kib}} [share-settings-kb]

Configure share settings in your `kibana.yml` configuration file.
Share settings allow you to customize behavior related to URL sharing in Kibana.

## URL Expiration settings [url-expiration-settings]

URL expiration settings control the behavior of unused URLs cleanup background task, which runs using Task Manager plugin. This task allows you to periodically cleanup saved objects of type `url` that have not been accessed in the specified period of time, specified by `share.url_expiration.duration` config option. Each saved object is a representation of a URL generated through the share functionality. Those settings are disabled by default. You need to manually configure them in order to use this feature.

::::{warning}
We do not recommend enabling this on lower tier Elasticsearch instances as it can lead to memory spikes and instability. The minimum recommend Elasticsearch instance to use the default setting should have 2 GB RAM. Lower tier instances shouldnâ€™t set `share.url_expiration.url_limit` to more than `1000`.
