# Kibana audit events

Audit logging is a [subscription feature](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) that you can enable to keep track of security-related events, such as authorization success and failures. Logging these events enables you to monitor Kibana for suspicious activity and provides evidence in the event of an attack.

Refer to [enabling](docs-content://deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/enabling-audit-logs.md) and [configuring](docs-content://deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/configuring-audit-logs.md) audit logs for details on activation and tunning.

## Kibana audit events [xpack-security-ecs-audit-logging]

This section describes {{kib}} events that can be logged for auditing purposes.

Each event is broken down into `category`, `type`, `action`, and `outcome` fields to make it easy to filter, query and aggregate the resulting logs. The `trace.id` field can be used to correlate multiple events that originate from the same request.

Refer to [audit schema](#xpack-security-ecs-audit-schema) for a table of fields logged with audit events.

::::{note}
To ensure that a record of every operation is persisted even in case of an unexpected error, asynchronous write operations are logged immediately after all authorization checks have passed, but before the response from {{es}} is received. Refer to the corresponding {{es}} logs for potential write errors.
