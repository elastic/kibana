# {{ibm-r}} connector and action [resilient-action-type]


The {{ibm-r}} connector uses the [RESILIENT REST v2](https://developer.ibm.com/security/resilient/rest/) to create {{ibm-r}} incidents.


## Create connectors in {{kib}} [define-resilient-ui]

You can create connectors in **{{stack-manage-app}} > {{connectors-ui}}** or as needed when you’re creating a rule. For example:

:::{image} ../../images/resilient-connector.png
:alt: {{ibm-r}} connector
:class: screenshot
:::


### Connector configuration [resilient-connector-configuration]

{{ibm-r}} connectors have the following configuration properties:

API key ID
:   The authentication key ID for HTTP Basic authentication.

API key secret
:   The authentication key secret for HTTP Basic authentication.

Organization ID
:   The {{ibm-r}} organization ID.

URL
:   The {{ibm-r}} instance URL.


## Test connectors [resilient-action-configuration]

You can test connectors as you’re creating or editing the connector in {{kib}}. For example:

:::{image} ../../images/resilient-params-test.png

:class: screenshot
:::

{{ibm-r}} actions have the following configuration properties.

Additional comments
:   Extra information for the client, such as how to troubleshoot the issue.

Description
:   The details about the incident.

Incident type

## Connector networking configuration [resilient-connector-networking-configuration]

Use the [action configuration settings](/reference/configuration-reference/alerting-settings.md#action-settings) to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.
