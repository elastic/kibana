# Slack connector and action [slack-action-type]

The Slack connector uses incoming webhooks or an API method to send Slack messages.

## Create connectors in {{kib}} [define-slack-ui]

You can create connectors in **{{stack-manage-app}} > {{connectors-ui}}** or as needed when you're creating a rule. You can choose to use a webhook URL that's specific to a single channel. For example:

:::{image} ../images/slack-webhook-connector.png
:alt: Slack connector
:screenshot:
:::

Alternatively, you can create a connector that supports multiple channels. For example:

:::{image} ../images/slack-api-connector.png
:alt: Slack API connector
:screenshot:
:::

If you use the latter method, you must provide a valid list of Slack channels. Do one of the following:

- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.3+` In the **Allowed channel names** field, you can enter up to 500 channels. Channel names must include a `#` at the front, for example: `#alert-notifications`. If you don't specify allowed channels, you can enter any channel name when configuring the Slack action for a rule.

- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.2`: In the **Channel IDs** field, enter the IDs of the Slack channels you want to message.

When you create a rule, each action can communicate with one of the specified channels. For Slack setup details, go to [Configure a Slack account](#configuring-slack).

### Connector configuration [slack-connector-configuration]

Slack connectors have the following configuration properties:

Webhook URL
:   The incoming webhook URL. This is required for webhook-based Slack connectors.

Bot User OAuth Token
:   The Slack bot user OAuth token. This is required for Web API Slack connectors.

Allowed channel names
:   {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.3+` The Slack channel names that the Web API connector can send messages to. Channel names must start with `#`, for example `#alert-notifications`. If you don't specify allowed channels, the connector can send messages to any channel name.

Channel IDs
:   {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.2` The Slack channel IDs that the Web API connector can send messages to.

## Test connectors [slack-action-configuration]

You can test connectors as you're creating or editing the connector in {{kib}}. For the webhook type of connector, its message text cannot contain Markdown, images, or other advanced formatting:

:::{image} ../images/slack-webhook-params.png
:alt: Slack webhook connector test
:screenshot:
:::

For the Web API type of connector, you must choose one of the channel IDs or names. You can then test either plain text or Block Kit messages:

:::{image} ../images/slack-api-connector-test.png
:alt: Slack web API connector test
:screenshot:
:::

After you add Block Kit messages, you can click a link to preview them in the Slack Block Kit Builder.

## Action parameters [slack-action-parameters]

Webhook Slack connectors have the following action parameter:

Message
:   The text to send to the connector's webhook channel.

Web API Slack connectors have the following actions:

Post message
:   Send a plain text message to a Slack channel.
    - `channelNames` (optional): Slack channel names. Channel names must start with `#`, for example `#alerts`. Only one channel is supported. Takes priority over `channelIds` and `channels`.
    - `channelIds` (optional): Slack channel IDs, for example `C123ABC456`. Only one channel is supported.
    - `channels` (optional, deprecated): Legacy channel values. Use `channelNames` or `channelIds` instead.
    - `text` (required): Message text.

Post Block Kit
:   Send a Slack [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) message to a Slack channel.
    - `channelNames` (optional): Slack channel names. Channel names must start with `#`, for example `#alerts`. Only one channel is supported. Takes priority over `channelIds` and `channels`.
    - `channelIds` (optional): Slack channel IDs, for example `C123ABC456`. Only one channel is supported.
    - `channels` (optional, deprecated): Legacy channel values. Use `channelNames` or `channelIds` instead.
    - `text` (required): A JSON string that contains the Block Kit payload. The JSON object must include a top-level `blocks` property. In workflow YAML, use a block scalar (`|`) when the payload spans multiple lines.

Validate channel ID
:   Validate whether a Slack channel ID can be used by the connector.
    - `channelId` (optional): Slack channel ID to validate.

## Workflow examples [slack-workflow-examples]

In workflow YAML, the Slack Web API action is part of the step `type`. Put the action parameters directly under `with`; don't add `subAction` or `subActionParams`.

Send a plain text message:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: post_message_to_slack
    type: slack_api.postMessage
    connector-id: <connector-id>
    with:
      channelNames:
        - '#alerts'
      text: 'Workflow finished successfully'
```

Send a Block Kit message. The `text` field is a JSON string that contains the Slack `blocks` payload:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: post_digest_to_slack
    type: slack_api.postBlockkit
    connector-id: <connector-id>
    with:
      channelIds:
        - C123ABC456
      text: |
        {
          "blocks": [
            {
              "type": "header",
              "text": {
                "type": "plain_text",
                "text": "Daily report",
                "emoji": true
              }
            },
            {
              "type": "section",
              "text": {
                "type": "mrkdwn",
                "text": "*Summary*"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
```

## Connector networking configuration [slack-connector-networking-configuration]

Use the [Action configuration settings](/reference/configuration-reference/alerting-settings.md#action-settings) to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.

## Configure a Slack account [configuring-slack]

Before you can create a Slack connector, you must configure your account and obtain the necessary URL or token.

### Configure a Slack account for incoming webhooks [configuring-slack-webhook]

1. Log in to [slack.com](http://slack.com) as a team administrator.
2. Create a Slack app, enable incoming webhooks, then create an incoming webhook. Refer to [https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).
3. Copy the generated webhook URL so you can paste it into your Slack connector form.
4. If you are using the [`xpack.actions.allowedHosts`](/reference/configuration-reference/alerting-settings.md#action-settings) setting, make sure the hostname from the URL is added to the allowed hosts.

### Configure a Slack account for Web API [configuring-slack-web-api]

1. Create a Slack app. Refer to [https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#creating](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#creating).
2. Add scope: `channels:read`, `groups:read`, `chat:write` and `chat:write.public`. Refer to [https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#scopes](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#scopes).
3. Install the app to a workspace. Refer to [https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#installing](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#installing).
4. Copy the `Bot User OAuth Token` so you can paste it into your Slack connector form.
5. If you need to send messages to a private channel, you need to write `/invite @App_name` in it. Putting "@" triggers Slack to start auto-suggesting, which is why it then becomes easy to find your app name in the list.
6. To find a channel ID (for example, `C123ABC456`), view the channel details.
