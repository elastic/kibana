# Microsoft Teams connector and action [teams-action-type]


The Microsoft Teams connector uses a webhook to send notifications.


## Create connectors in {{kib}} [define-teams-ui]

You can create connectors in **{{stack-manage-app}} > {{connectors-ui}}** or as needed when you’re creating a rule. For example:

:::{image} ../../images/teams-connector.png
:alt: Teams connector
:class: screenshot
:::


### Connector configuration [teams-connector-configuration]

Microsoft Teams connectors have the following configuration properties:

Name
:   The name of the connector.

Webhook URL
:   The URL of the incoming webhook. Refer to [Configure Microsoft Teams](#configuring-teams). If you are using the [`xpack.actions.allowedHosts`](/reference/configuration-reference/alerting-settings.md#action-settings) setting, make sure the hostname is added to the allowed hosts.


## Test connectors [teams-action-configuration]

You can test connectors as you’re creating or editing the connector in {{kib}}. For example:

:::{image} ../../images/teams-params-test.png
:alt: Teams params test
:class: screenshot
:::

Microsoft Teams actions have the following properties.

Message
:   The message text. Markdown, images, and other advanced formatting are not yet supported.


## Connector networking configuration [teams-connector-networking-configuration]

Use the [Action configuration settings](/reference/configuration-reference/alerting-settings.md#action-settings) to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.


## Configure Microsoft Teams [configuring-teams]

Microsoft 365 connectors are being [retired](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/); you must use the **Workflows** app to create a webhook URL. For example:

1. Go to the **Workflows** app in Teams and select the **Create** tab.
2. Create a workflow from a blank template.

    ::::{note}
    You cannot use the "Post to a channel when a webhook request is received" template; it does not work with the Microsoft Teams connector.
    ::::

3. Add a trigger as the first step in the workflow. Search for webhook triggers and select **When a Teams webhook request is received**. Set **Who can trigger the flow?** to `Anyone`.
4. Add **Post message in a chat or channel** as the second step in the workflow.

    1. Set **Post as** to `Flow bot`.
    2. Set **Post in** to `Channel`.
    3. Set **Team** and **Channel** to the appropriate values for where you want the message displayed.

        ::::{note}
        Per [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/teams/send-a-message-in-teams#known-issues-and-limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/teams/send-a-message-in-teams#known-issues-and-limitations), you cannot use a private channel.
        ::::

    4. Set the **Message** to `@{triggerBody()?['text']}`.

        Alternatively, you can add a **Parse JSON** step before the **Post message in a chat or channel** step in the workflow. Set the **Content** to `Body` and the **Schema** to the following value:

        ```json
        {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "text": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            }
        }
        ```

5. Save the workflow and copy the HTTP POST URL from the first step. This is the URL required by the Microsoft Teams connector.
