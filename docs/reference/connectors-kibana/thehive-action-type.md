# {{hive}} connector and action [thehive-action-type]


{{hive}} connector uses the [{{hive}} (v1) REST API](https://docs.strangebee.com/thehive/api-docs/) to create cases and alerts. [8.16.0]

::::{note}
If you use this connector with [cases](docs-content://explore-analyze/alerts-cases/cases.md), the status values differ in {{kib}} and {{hive}}. The status values are not synchronized when you update a case.

::::



## Create connectors in {{kib}} [define-thehive-ui]

You can create connectors in **{{stack-manage-app}} > {{connectors-ui}}** or as needed when you’re creating a rule. For example:

:::{image} ../../images/thehive-connector.png
:alt: {{hive}} connector
:class: screenshot
:::
