# {{sn-sir}} connector and action [servicenow-sir-action-type]


The {{sn-sir}} connector uses the [import set API](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/sandiego/rest/c_ImportSetAPI) to create {{sn}} security incidents. You can use the connector for rule actions and cases.


## Create connectors in {{kib}} [define-servicenow-sir-ui]

You can create connectors in **{{stack-manage-app}} > {{connectors-ui}}** or as needed when you’re creating a rule. You must choose whether to use OAuth for authentication.

### Connector configuration [servicenow-sir-connector-configuration]

{{sn-sir}} connectors have the following configuration properties:

Client ID
:   The client ID assigned to your OAuth application.

Client Secret
:   The client secret assigned to your OAuth application.

JWT verifier key ID
:   The key identifier assigned to the JWT verifier map of your OAuth application.

Password
:   The password for HTTP basic authentication.

Private key
:   The RSA private key that you created for use in {{sn}}.

Private key password
:   The password for the RSA private key. This value is required if you set a password for your private key.

{{sn}} instance URL
:   The full {{sn}} instance URL.

Use OAuth authentication
:   By default, basic authentication is used instead of open authorization (OAuth).

User identifier
:   The identifier to use for OAuth type authentication. This identifier should be the user field you selected during setup. For example, if the selected user field is `Email`, the user identifier should be the user’s email address.

Username
:   The username for HTTP basic authentication.


## Test connectors [servicenow-sir-action-configuration]

You can test connectors as you’re creating or editing the connector in {{kib}}. For example:

:::{image} ../../images/servicenow-sir-params-test.png
:alt: {{sn-sir}} params test
:class: screenshot
:::

{{sn-sir}} actions have the following configuration properties.

Additional comments
:   Additional information for the client, such as how to troubleshoot the issue.

Additional fields
:   An object that contains custom field identifiers and their values. These fields must exist in the Elastic ServiceNow application and must be specified in JSON format.

    For example:

    ```sh
    {
        "u_cmdb_ci": "host-a",
        "u_company": "My company",
        "u_assignment_group": "Testing"
    }
    ```

    Note that the default source field names in the Elastic ServiceNow application are prefixed with "u_".


Category
:   The category of the incident.

Correlation display
:   A descriptive label of the alert for correlation purposes in {{sn}}.

Correlation ID
:   Connectors using the same correlation ID will be associated with the same {{sn}} incident. This value determines whether a new {{sn}} incident will be created or an existing one is updated. Modifying this value is optional; if not modified, the rule ID and alert ID are combined as `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` to form the correlation ID value in {{sn}}. The maximum character length for this value is 100 characters.

    ::::{note}
    Using the default configuration of `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` ensures that {{sn}} will create a separate incident record for every generated alert that uses a unique alert ID. If the rule generates multiple alerts that use the same alert IDs, {{sn}} creates and continually updates a single incident record for the alert.
    ::::


Description
:   The details about the incident.

Priority
:   The priority of the incident.

Short description
:   A short description for the incident, used for searching the contents of the knowledge base.

Subcategory
:   The subcategory of the incident.


## Connector networking configuration [servicenow-sir-connector-networking-configuration]

Use the [Action configuration settings](/reference/configuration-reference/alerting-settings.md#action-settings) to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.


## Configure {{sn-sir}} [configuring-servicenow-sir]

{{sn}} offers free [Personal Developer Instances](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/guides/madrid/now-platform/pdi-guide/obtaining-a-pdi), which you can use to test incidents.


### Prerequisites [servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites]

After upgrading from {{stack}} version 7.15.0 or earlier to version 7.16.0 or later, you must complete the following within your {{sn}} instance before creating a new {{sn-sir}} connector or [updating an existing one](#servicenow-sir-connector-update):

1. Install [Elastic for Security Operations (SecOps)](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/2f0746801baeb01019ae54e4604bcb0f) from the {{sn}} Store.
2. [Assign cross-scope privileges for the Elastic for Security Operations app](#servicenow-sir-connector-privileges).
3. [Create a {{sn}} integration user and assign it the appropriate roles](#servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-integration-user).
4. [Create a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rule](#servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-cors-rule).
5. If you use open authorization (OAuth), you must also:

    1. [Create an RSA keypair and add an X.509 Certificate](#servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-rsa-key).
    2. [Create an OAuth JWT API endpoint for external clients with a JWT Verifiers Map](#servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-endpoint).



### Assign cross-scope privileges [servicenow-sir-connector-privileges]

The Elastic for Security Operations app requires specific cross-scope privilege records to run successfully. In particular, you must have a privilege record for the `Elastic for Security Operations` application with the status set to `Allowed` for each of the following targets:

| Target scope | Name | Type | Operation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global | Glide API: string utilities | Scriptable | Execute API |
| Global | GlideRecord.insert | Scriptable | Execute API |
| Global | GlideRecord.setValue | Scriptable | Execute API |
| Global | GlideRecordSecure.getValue | Scriptable | Execute API |
| Global | RESTAPIRequest | Scriptable | Execute API |
| Global | RESTAPIRequestBody | Scriptable | Execute API |
| Global | ScopedGlideElement | Scriptable | Execute API |
| Global | ScriptableServiceResultBuilder.setBody | Scriptable | Execute API |
| Security incident response | sn_si_incident | Table | Read |
| Threat intelligence support common | sn_ti_m2m_task_observable | Table | Create |
| Threat intelligence support common | sn_ti_m2m_task_observable | Table | Read |
| Threat intelligence support common | sn_ti_observable | Table | Create |
| Threat intelligence support common | sn_ti_observable | Table | Read |
| Threat intelligence support common | sn_ti_observable_type | Table | Read |

To access the cross scope privileges table:

1. Log into {{sn}} and set your application scope to Elastic for Security Operations.
2. Click **All** and search for `sys_scope_privilege`.

For more details, refer to the [{{sn}} product documentation](https://docs.servicenow.com/).


### Create a {{sn}} integration user [servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-integration-user]

To ensure authenticated communication between Elastic and {{sn}}, create a {{sn}} integration user and assign it the appropriate roles. 

1. In your {{sn}} instance, go to **System Security → Users and Groups → Users**.
2. Click **New**.
3. Complete the form, then right-click on the menu bar and click **Save**.
4. Go to the **Roles** tab and click **Edit**.
5. Assign the integration user the following roles: 

    * `import_set_loader`
    * `import_transformer`
    * `personalize_choices`
    * `sn_si.basic`
    * `x_elas2_sir_int.integration_user`

6. Click **Save**.


### Create a CORS rule [servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-cors-rule]

A CORS rule is required for communication between Elastic and {{sn}}. To create a CORS rule:

1. In your {{sn}} instance, go to **System Web Services → REST → CORS Rules**.
2. Click **New**.
3. Configure the rule as follows:

    * **Name**: Name the rule.
    * **REST API**: Set the rule to use the Elastic SecOps API by choosing `Elastic SIR API [x_elas2_sir_int/elastic_api]`.
    * **Domain**: Enter the Kibana URL, including the port number.

4. Go to the **HTTP methods** tab and select **GET**.
5. Click **Submit** to create the rule.


### Create an RSA keypair and add an X.509 Certificate [servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-rsa-key]

This step is required to use OAuth for authentication between Elastic and {{sn}}.

**Create an RSA keypair:**

1. Use [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/genrsa.md) to generate an RSA private key.

    * To create a private key with a password, use the `passout` option. For example:

        ```sh
        openssl genrsa -passout pass:foobar -out example-private-key-with-password.pem 3072
        ```

    * To create a private key without a password, omit the `passout` option. For example:

        ```sh
        openssl genrsa -out example-private-key.pem 3072
        ```

2. Use [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/req.md) to generate the matching public key:

    ```sh
    openssl req -new -x509 -key example-private-key.pem -out example-sn-cert.pem -days 360
    ```


**Add an X.509 certificate to ServiceNow:**

1. In your {{sn}} instance, go to **Certificates** and select **New**.
2. Configure the certificate as follows:

    * **Name**: Name the certificate.
    * **PEM Certificate**: Copy the generated public key into this text field.

    :class: screenshot
    :::

3. Click **Submit** to create the certificate.


### Create an OAuth JWT API endpoint for external clients with a JWT Verifiers Map [servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites-endpoint]

This step is required to use OAuth for authentication between Elastic and {{sn}}.

1. In your {{sn}} instance, go to **Application Registry** and select **New**.
2. Select **Create an OAuth JWT API endpoint for external clients** from the list of options.

    :::{image} ../../images/servicenow-jwt-endpoint.png
    :alt: Shows application type selection
    :class: screenshot
    :::

3. Configure the application as follows:

    * **Name**: Name the application.
    * **User field**: Select the field to use as the user identifier.

    :::{image} ../../images/servicenow-new-application.png
    :alt: Shows new application form in ServiceNow
    :class: screenshot
    :::

    ::::{important}
    Remember the selected user field. You will use this as the **User Identifier Value** when creating the connector. For example, if you selected **Email** for **User field**, you will use the user’s email for the **User Identifier Value**.
    ::::

4. Click **Submit** to create the application. You will be redirected to the list of applications.
5. Select the application you just created.
6. Find the **Jwt Verifier Maps** tab and click **New**.
7. Configure the new record as follows:

    * **Name**: Name the JWT Verifier Map.
    * **Sys certificate**: Click the search icon and select the name of the certificate created in the previous step.

    :::{image} ../../images/servicenow-new-jwt-verifier-map.png
    :alt: Shows new JWT Verifier Map form in ServiceNow
    :class: screenshot
    :::

8. Click **Submit** to create the verifier map.
9. Note the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **JWT Key ID**. You will need these values to create your {{sn}} connector.
