== Introduction

Kibana is an open source (Apache Licensed), browser based analytics and search dashboard for
ElasticSearch. Kibana is a snap to setup and start using. Written entirely in HTML and Javascript
it requires only a plain webserver, Kibana requires no fancy server side components.
Kibana strives to be easy to get started with, while also being flexible and powerful, just like
Elasticsearch.

NOTE: Kibana 3 depends on the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/search-facets.html[_facets_]
feature. Facets were removed in the 2.0 release of Elasticsearch. Kibana 3 does not support Elasticsearch versions greater
than 1.7.
