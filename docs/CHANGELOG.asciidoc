.Importing and copying saved objects causes weak links to break
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
{kib} supports weak links in some saved objects. For example, a dashboard may include a Markdown panel that contains a relative URL to
another dashboard. Weak links are defined by free text, _not_ the saved object's relationships, and can break if **both** of the following
conditions are true:

* You are importing saved objects into multiple spaces, _OR_ you are copying saved objects into another space
* Before you upgraded to 8.0.0, the saved objects did not already exist in the destinations

In 8.0.0 and later, weak links break because <<saved-object-ids-impact-when-using-import-and-copy,saved object IDs can change during import or copy>>.
This applies to both the UI and the API.
This issue will be fixed 8.0.1 and 8.1.0. For more information, refer to {kibana-issue}123550[#123550].

*Impact* +
Saved objects in 7.x that are migrated during upgrade are **not** impacted.
Only _new_ saved objects that are imported or copied _multiple times_ (causing object IDs to change) are impacted.
If you are impacted, you can re-import or re-copy your saved objects after the fix is
implemented to preserve the weak links.

.Removed support for time-based interval index patterns
[%collapsible]

.Removed platform from archive root directory
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
After you extract an archive, the output directory no longer includes the target platform. For example, `kibana-8.0.0-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` produces a `kibana-8.0.0` folder. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}93835[#93835].

*Impact* +

[[breaking-90511]]
.Removed default support for TLS v1.0 and v1.1
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The default support for TLS v1.0 and v1.1 has been removed. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}90511[#90511].

*Impact* +
To enable support, set `--tls-min-1.0` in the `node.options` configuration file. To locate the configuration file, go to the kibana/config folder or any other configuration with the `KBN_PATH_CONF` environment variable. For example, if you are using a Debian-based system, the configuration file is located in /etc/kibana.

[[breaking-74424]]
.Removed support for sysv init
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
All supported operating systems use systemd service files. Any system that doesn’t have `service` aliased to use kibana.service should use `systemctl start kibana.service` instead of `service start kibana`. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}74424[#74424].

*Impact* +
If your installation uses .deb or .rpm packages with SysV, migrate to systemd.

[[breaking-42353]]
.Disabled response logging as a default
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In previous versions, all events are logged in `json` when `logging.json:true`. With the new logging configuration, you can choose the `json` and pattern output formats with layouts. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}42353[#42353].

*Impact* +
To restore the previous behavior, configure the logging format for each custom appender with the `appender.layout property` in kibana.yml. There is no default for custom appenders, and each appender must be configured expilictly.

[source,yaml]
-------------------
logging:
  appenders:
    custom_console:
      type: console
      layout:
        type: pattern
    custom_json:
      type: console
      layout:
        type: json
  loggers:
    - name: plugins.myPlugin
      appenders: [custom_console]

[[breaking-47929]]
.Removed `/api/security/v1/saml` route
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `/api/security/v1/saml` route has been removed and is reflected in the kibana.yml `server.xsrf.whitelist` setting, {es}, and the Identity Provider SAML settings. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}47929[#47929]

*Impact* +
Use the `/api/security/saml/callback` route, or wait to upgrade to 8.0.0-alpha2 when the `/api/security/saml/callback` route breaking change is reverted. 
====

[discrete]
[[breaking-41700]]
.Reject legacy browsers by default
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
To provide the maximum level of protection for most installations, the csp.strict config is now enabled by default. Legacy browsers not supported by Kibana, such as Internet Explorer 11, are unable to access {kib} unless explicitly enabled. All browsers officially supported by Kibana do not have this issue. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}41700[#41700]

*Impact* +
To enable support for legacy browsers, set `csp.strict: false` in kibana.yml. To effectively enforce the security protocol, we strongly discourage disabling `csp.strict` unless it is critical that you support Internet Explorer 11.
