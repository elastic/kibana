[[bug-6.3.1]]
=== Bug fixes

Machine Learning::
* Fixes issues when watching the scope of single metric viewer 
data {pull}19029[#19029]

Management::
* [Fixes #19617] Shows internal indices if *Include system indices* is toggled
on and no other indices exist {pull}19618[#19618]
* [Fixes #19483] Adds `aria-labelledby` to index details flyout to tell 
screen reader what to announce when the flyout is opened {pull}19776[#19776] 
* [Fixes #19048] Adds heading hierarchy to Management landing page and `role='group'`

* Changes license checker and generator behavior to only add dev dependencies 
with the `--dev` flag {pull}19626[#19626]

Platform::
* [Fixes #20017] Updates the {xpack} plugin status anytime the license changes
{pull}20018[#20018]
+
When using {xpack}, it was previously possible for {kib} to get stuck in a "red"
state, preventing access to the {kib} applications, if {kib} and {es} were 
started at the same time. We've fixed this issue to ensure that {kib} is always
usable when it's able to talk to {es}.

for joining region maps to {es} results {pull}19447[#19447]




[[release-notes-6.3.0]]
== {kib} 6.3.0

[float]
[[breaking-6.3.0]]
=== Breaking Changes

Operations::
+
As of Kibana 6.3.0, X-Pack is bundled by default in the default distribution. 
Existing X-Pack users should remove the plugin before upgrading.
+
There is a known issue preventing `bin/kibana-plugin` from removing the pre-existing 
plugin after upgrading. This will be resolved in 6.3.1. If you happen to encounter this issue, 
there are a few options:
+
* **Uninstall the plugin before upgrading:** `bin/kibana-plugin remove x-pack`
* **Uninstall the plugin after upgrading:** Manually delete the `plugins/x-pack` directory.

Platform::
* Renames saved objects bulk_get and find endpoints {pull}17512[#17512]
+
To support sending larger and more expressive queries to the Saved Objects find
API, we added a POST endpoint for find and therefore needed a way to disambiguate
the find API from from the POST API used to create Saved Objects.
+
Starting in {kib} 6.3, endpoints that are not simple CRUD operations on a single
object will be named and their name will start with an underscore. For example,
{es} `GET /api/saved_objects` is now `GET /api/saved_objects/_find`,
`GET /api/saved_objects/{type}` is now `GET /api/saved_objects/_find?type={type}`,
and `GET /api/saved_objects/bulk_get` is now `GET /api/saved_objects/_bulk_get`.

[float]
=== New Features

For an overview of the features that were added in 6.3 and how the user experience
improved, see <<release-highlights-6.3.0, 6.3.0 Release Highlights>>.

[float]
=== Enhancements

Machine learning::
* You can now use {ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[cross cluster search]
in the {ml} features in {kib}. If you have configured a cross cluster index
pattern in {kib}, you can use that index pattern when you create jobs.

Platform::
* Angular was upgraded to version 1.6.9 {pull}17677[#17677]


[float]
=== Bug Fixes

* Removes the unsupported type from autocomplete options {pull}17694[#17694]
* Fixes an issue with autocomplete in the console {pull}17678[#17678]
+
Endpoint definitions are expected to have unique names, and the code was using
the same name for endpoints with overloaded HTTP verb semantics. This code fixes
those names by adding a timestamp.

Monitoring::
* Changes the Advanced Node page for {es} to recognize the `write` threadpool
{pull}18147[#18147]

Operations::
* [Fixes #6688] Adds support for environment variable injection in the

Security::
* Preserves boom error headers for index pattern exceptions {pull}17725[#17725]
+

WWW-Authenticate headers on 401s. This caused basic authentication via {kib} to not
work properly in some configurations.

{pull}18931[#18931]
* [Fixes #19252] Fixes copy to the clipboard in Internet Explorer
{pull}19281[#19281]

manages its dependencies {pull}17829[#17829]

[float]
=== Regressions

Management::

* In 6.2.4, if users edit a watch or a logstash pipeline and navigate away from 
the page without saving, a confirmation modals asks if they want to save the 
changes. In 6.3, the prompt was disabled to fix {pull}19488[#19488] and 
{pull}19608[#19608].

[[release-notes-6.1.0]]
== {kib} 6.1.0

[float]
=== Enhancements

Design::
* [Fixes #12889] Make saved-object-finder and paginated-selectable-list accessible {pull}13834[#13834]
* [Fixes #12901] [UI Framework] Add KuiCodeEditor as react-ace replacement/wrapper {pull}14026[#14026]
* [UI Framework] KuiGalleryItem automatically becomes link or button {pull}14240[#14240]

Dev Tools::
* [Fixes #11522] Improve Dev Tools accessibility {pull}13496[#13496]
  - Console no longer traps keyboard focus. You can quit editing with Escape.

Discover::
* [Fixes #12633, #12641] Improve accessibility of the discover app {pull}13498[#13498]
* [Fixes #14456] [Accessibility] Improve filter bar accessibility {pull}14474[#14474]

Machine Learning::
* Added the ability to create and display forecasts for {ml} jobs in {kib}.
* Simplified job creation for certain recognizable data sources, such as
Filebeat access logs from Nginx and Apache HTTP servers.
* Added a Data Visualizer, which enables you to learn more about the
characteristics of your data and identify fields for {ml} analysis. For more
information, see <<ml-jobs>>.
* Added bucket span to the chart labels in the Single Metric Viewer.
* Added support for job groups when managing jobs in {kib}.
* Added the ability to show or hide the Anomaly Explorer charts by selecting a
checkbox. The choice is saved in the URL, so it persists if you re-open the
view from a bookmarked URL.
* Added a new job creation wizard for population jobs, which detect activity
that is unusual compared to the behavior of the population. For more information,
see {stack-ov}/ml-configuring-pop.html[Performing Population Analysis].
* Added the ability to control the maximum number of rows in the Anomaly
Explorer view by swimlane, with options of `5`, `10`, `25`, or `50`. Previously,
it was fixed to a maximum of 10 rows.
* Changed the job creation wizards such that you select an index pattern or
saved search before you select the type of job.
* Added licensing checks to the job creation features in {kib}. If the license
is expired, for example, the create job, edit job, clone job, and start {dfeed}
buttons are disabled.
* Added the ability to set the model memory limit in job creation wizards. For
more information about the `model_memory_limit` property, see
{ref}/ml-job-resource.html#ml-apilimits[Job Resource Analysis Limits].
* Added a **Close Job** button that enables you to force the closure of a job
when it fails. The button is disabled if the job is running, closed, or does not
have a {dfeed}.
* Added the ability to display jobs with multiple detectors in the Single Metric
Viewer when the `model_plot_config` property is enabled. Previously, this
functionality was only possible for jobs with a single detector.

Management::
* [Fixes #12867] &quot;Create index pattern&quot; wizard.  {pull}13454[#13454]
  - Introducing a new wizard to create index patterns that makes index discovery and matching much easier than before.
* [Fixes #12668] add an option for url types so that it can be opened in current tab (master branch) {pull}13209[#13209]

* Add rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; to external links {pull}14440[#14440]

Monitoring::
* Added Cross Cluster Search (CCS) to efficiently retrieve monitoring data from
local and remote clusters.
* Improved handling of health check errors. If there is a problem making a query,
for example, an error is returned and extra information is provided in the logs.
As part of this change, the `monitoring` plugin for {kib} will never cause {kib}
to go `red`.
* Improved logging when X-Pack is not installed on the monitoring cluster.
* Saved table interaction states such that if you leave the {kib} page and
subsequently return, your filters persist.

Operations::
* [Fixes #11091] Adds keystore for storing settings {pull}14714[#14714]

* [Fixes #8499] [server/logging] Allow opting out of UTC {pull}14705[#14705]
* Improve performance of sort_prefix_first for large arrays {pull}14974[#14974]

Reporting::
* Added support for a HTTP Proxy to be configured when using Chromium as the
browser. For more information, see <<reporting-chromium-settings>>.
* Added headless build of Chromium that can be used instead of PhantomJS for
capturing Reporting screenshots. To enable Chromium, set the following setting
in your `kibana.yml` file: `xpack.reporting.capture.browser.type: chromium`. For
now PhantomJS will remain the default. In the future, however, Chromium will
become the default.
* Added an option for PDF reports that preserves the existing layout and size of
the Visualization or Dashboard.

Security::
* Added `manage_index_templates` cluster privileges to the `kibana_system` role,
which enables the {kib} system user to create and manage the index template for
the `.kibana` index. For more information, see
{stack-ov}/security-privileges.html[Security Privileges] and
{stack-ov}/built-in-roles.html[Built-in Roles].

Sharing::

  - pie charts can now have labels on them to increase readability
* [Fixes #13519, #13103, #13968] Improve Region Maps for use without network connection {pull}15056[#15056]
  - Improve the use of Region Maps for deployment in environments without internet access. Similar to the Coordinate Map visualization, the Region map can now use a WMS-service as a base-layer. Admins can now also setup Kibana to opt-out of connection to the Elastic Maps Service. Users can now opt-out of having the visualization display warnings.
* Introduce lab mode for visualizations {pull}15050[#15050]
  - Newly introduced visualizations can now be part of labs-mode. Visualizations in labs-mode introduce new more cutting-edge functionality and can be subject to change across minor releases.  Labs-mode can be turned off in the advanced settings. Labs-visualization will then no longer be available to the user. The Time Series Visual Builder is not part of labs-mode, it continues to be an experimental feature. The input controls are the first to be flagged as a lab visualization.
* reverts metric visualization {pull}14052[#14052]
  - The metric visualization now no longer reuses the rendering code of the gauge and goal visualizations. This improves consistency of positioning of the metric on Dashboards.

  - This PR adds support for the Math aggregation to the new TSVB table visualization. This wasn't possible at the time of the PR because both features were separated. This also adds support for the drop last bucket feature.
* [TSVB] Series Filter {pull}14696[#14696]
  - This PR adds the series filter feature allowing the user to create a filter per series. This allows users to user to have a group by terms along with a filter for each series.
* [Fixes #13992] Grab the default index pattern and use it in TSVB {pull}14739[#14739]
  - TSVB now uses Kibana's default index pattern by default.

Machine Learning::
* Fixed scenarios where clicking the "View examples" link in the Anomalies
section of the Single Metric Viewer or Anomaly Explorer caused the browser to hang.
* Fixed scenarios where the Anomaly Explorer or Single Metric Viewer failed to
plot metric data in the charts due to a blank field name in a detector. This
problem was specific to jobs that were originally created in 5.4.

Management::
* [Fixes #12612] Create keyboard mode for ui-ace editor {pull}13339[#13339]
  - Our code editor in several places won't trap keyboard focus anymore, by using the Tab key. When navigating by keyboard, you first need to Enter editing mode in the code editor and you can leave it by pressing Escape.

Monitoring::
* Fixed problems viewing pipelines in {kib} from a Firefox web browser.
For more information, see
{logstash-ref}/logstash-pipeline-viewer.html[Pipeline Viewer UI].
* The `xpack.monitoring.node_resolver` setting, which was deprecated in 5.5.0,
now allows only the `uuid` value to be used. This setting will be removed in 7.0.

* [Fixes #9523] Fix issue where saved searches are not updated {pull}14452[#14452]
  - There has been a long standing issue where if you add a saved search to a dashboard, then go edit and save that saved search, the updates are not propagated to the dashboard.  The only way, previously, to get the new changes was to remove and re-add the search from your dashboard. With this fix, that is no longer necessary. However, there is one situation when your saved search will stop updating and that is when someone has made and saved local edits to the saved search on the dashboard.  For example, if you remove a column from a saved search in a dashboard panel, then save the dashboard, that search will always show that column set, even if columns are added or removed to the underlying saved search. We did it this way to still allow users to override the configuration at the dashboard level.

[[release-notes-6.0.1]]
== {kib} 6.0.1

[float]
[[security-6.0.1]]
=== Security Issues

* ​Kibana cross site scripting issue (ESA-2017-22): Kibana versions prior to 6.0.1 and 5.6.5 had a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via URL fields that could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of other Kibana users. CVE ID: CVE-2017-11481

* Kibana open redirect flaw (ESA-2017-23) : The Kibana fix for CVE-2017-8451 was found to be incomplete. With X-Pack installed, Kibana versions before 6.0.1 and 5.6.5 have an open redirect vulnerability on the login page that would enable an attacker to craft a link that redirects to an arbitrary website. CVE ID: CVE-2017-11482

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 6.0.1 or 5.6.5. There are no known workarounds for these issues.

[[release-notes-6.0.0]]
== {kib} 6.0.0

[float]
=== Breaking Changes

Reporting::
* When {security} is enabled, reports will only be accessible to the user that created them.
* When {security} is enabled, user authorization is controlled by the
`xpack.reporting.roles.allow` setting in the `kibana.yml` which defaults to
`['reporting_user']`. Users will no longer have access to the underlying {reporting}
indices in {es} when assigned to the built-in `reporting_user` role. If using
custom reporting roles, the privileges to the indices will need to be removed, and the
role will need to be added to the `xpack-reporting.roles.allow` setting.

Security::
* The built-in users (`elastic`, `kibana`, and `logstash_system`) no longer have
default passwords. You must create passwords for these users and configure {kib}
to use this information. For more information, see
{stack-ov}/setting-up-authentication.html[Setting Up User Authentication].

Watcher::
* The built-in HTTP client used in webhooks, the http input and the http email attachment has been replaced.
This results in the need to always escape all parts of an URL.
* The new built-in HTTP client also enforces a maximum request size, which defaults to 10mb.
* The watch `_status` field has been renamed to `status`, as underscores in
field names will not be allowed.

[float]
=== Enhancements

Core::
* Remove legacy pre-4.2 configurations {pull}12013[#12013]
* NODE_ENV no longer has an impact on Kibana {pull}12010[#12010]
* Only support 64 bit operating systems {pull}11941[#11941]
* Remove field_stats pre-flight option for index patterns {pull}12814[#12814]
* [Fixes #13439] Upgrade Angular to 1.6.5 {pull}13543[#13543]

Dashboard::
*  If you had a chance to check out the new Dashboard Only Mode in 6.0.0-beta1,
we've changed things up a bit for 6.0.0-beta2. Previously we required you to
flag every role a user belonged to as being in the View dashboards only mode
in order for that user to be flagged as a Dashboard only mode user. In this
new set up, we created a reserved role, `kibana_dashboard_only_user`, that is
already pre-configured with read only access to the .kibana index, and set up
to be in Dashboard Only Mode. All you have to add is this one role to any user
and they will now be a Dashboard Only Mode user. We also got rid of this new
setting in the Roles UI, as this one role should suffice for most user's setups.
If you have a more complicated setup, such as multi-tenancy with multiple
`.kibana` indexes, you can create more dashboard only mode roles by adding
role names to the `xpackDashboardMode:roles` advanced setting. For more
information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-dashboard-only-mode.html[Kibana Dashboard Only Mode].

* Implement new Kibana query language {pull}12624[#12624]
  - This PR adds a new experimental query language to Kibana. The new language is turned off by default but can be enabled in the Management > Advanced Settings via the search:queryLanguage:switcher:enable option. Changing this setting to true will add a language selector to the query bar that allows users to choose the new language for their query. Details of the new query language can be found in the issue description (#12282).
* Remove highlight query {pull}13231[#13231]
* [Fixes #12635]  Improve the accessibility of the Discover screen {pull}12681[#12681]
* [Fixes #12343] Remove custom keyboard navigation in datepicker {pull}13644[#13644]
* Accessible sort buttons {pull}12217[#12217]
* [Accessibility] Avoid empty th in doc-table header row {pull}12364[#12364]
  - The discover document table header cells provide appropriate hints to screen-readers.
* [Accessibility] Add button to skip past the discover doc table {pull}12539[#12539]
  - The new "Skip to bottom"-button in Discover is invisible unless focused. When activated it displays all remaining rows that were already loaded and focuses an anchor located below the table.
* Timepicker on the right {pull}11980[#11980]

Machine Learning::
* Added a Datafeed Preview tab to expanded rows in the jobs list under
Job Management. This displays the JSON response from the preview endpoint.
* Added an option to create a watch when you start a {dfeed} in {kib}. After the
{dfeed} starts, you are prompted to specify details such as the interval and the
anomaly severity threshold. If {watcher} is disabled, this option does not appear.
* Updated the bucket span estimator, which suggests bucket span values when you
create jobs in {kib}. The estimator now suggests a minimum bucket span value
of 15 minutes.

Management::
* [indexPatterns] remove support for time patterns {pull}12158[#12158]
  - Removes ability to create index patterns based on time patterns/intervals  - Adds a warning that informs users when they are using an index pattern that is now unsupported (disabled by default until #10442 is done, #12322)  - Does not address editing/remapping index patterns, see last task in #12242
* [Fix for #11526, #8225] Move build info from management section to status page {pull}13341[#13341]
* [Management] Provide a way to fetch indices and template index patterns {pull}12200[#12200]
* [Management] More universal solution for fetching indices and aliases {pull}12405[#12405]
* Add breadcrumb-page-title to management-app {pull}12765[#12765]
  - The bread-crumbs component allows for the consumer to pass in a page-title value which is appended as the final breadcrumb in the chain. This PR adds a scope argument to the management-app to take advantage of it.

Monitoring::
* The Logstash Pipeline viewer in {kib} displays an information icon and a
corresponding tip for every plugin that does not define an ID explicitly.
Defining an ID for plugins enables you to track differences across pipeline
changes. For more information, see
{logstash-ref}/logstash-pipeline-viewer.html[Pipeline Viewer UI].
* Added an alert in clusters that have trial licenses and have enabled {security}
but do not have TLS/SSL configured. The message provides information about the
steps that are required to enable {security} when they obtain a non-trial license.
* Added support for cluster alerts, for example to provide information about
license expiration.
* Added an advanced setting for a default admin e-mail, which is the recipient
of {xpack} admin operations such as cluster alert e-mail notifications.

Operations::
* Updates to status API, re-align status page {pull}10180[#10180]
* [Fix for #10181] Revert same port http -> https redirect {pull}10930[#10930]
  - Kibana 5.x redirected requests from http to https on the same port if TLS was configured. Starting in Kibana 6.0.0 Kibana no longer redirects basic http traffic to https.
* Update mappings for kibana index {pull}9280[#9280]
* Use single ES document type {pull}12794[#12794]
  - Starting in Elasticsearch 6.0, you are no longer able to create new indices with multiple index types. To accomplish the same effect as index types, a new type field was added to identify the document and the value mapped under the index to allow for strict mapping.
* [logging] Downgrade hapi connection errors when connecting with the w… {pull}11209[#11209]
* [status] 15m load average should use the 3rd index {pull}11202[#11202]
* [Fixes #9436] [optimizer] remove support for .jsx extension {pull}12712[#12712]
* Sets ES mapping to single_type=false {pull}11451[#11451]

Platform::
* [Fix for #12012] Fail to start if settings include unknown keys {pull}12554[#12554]
  - When a config file includes invalid keys or values, Kibana usually logs a message describing the issue and fails to start. There has been an exception to this rule since 4.2 that allowed top-level keys to be unknown/misspelled and only caused a warning to be logged. That exception has been removed and now any unknown or misspelled config key passed to Kibana (via the config file or command line flags) will prevent it from starting.
* Remove the es_admin proxy {pull}13000[#13000]
* Restrict ES data proxy to msearch and search {pull}13020[#13020]
* [server/indexPatterns] expose indexPatternService getter/factory {pull}13012[#13012]

* Uses uuid for auto-generated ids and prepends type (#12834) {pull}12877[#12877]
* [uiSettings] support defining settings with uiExports {pull}12250[#12250]
  - define a uiExports.uiSettingDefaults key your plugin definition to add uiSettingDefaults - uiSettingDefaults must be unique. If a key is already defined elsewhere then the server will not start. - defined settings will display in the advanced settings editor, along with the intended default value and description - the REST API is identical to before - the browser API is identical to before - defaults for timelion have been extracted to the timelion plugin definition and the existing defaults are defined in the kibana plugin definition
* Refactor commaList filter logic into common util {pull}12553[#12553]
* [kbnServer/extensions] formalize request factories with helper {pull}12697[#12697]
* Allow plugins to turn off the "link to last URL" navigation helper {pull}13044[#13044]

Reporting::
* Enabled export as CSV.

Security::
* Added a View Dashboards Only setting to the roles section under
Security management. If a user is assigned a role that has this setting
enabled, when they access Kibana it presents Dashboard Only mode.
* Added reserved `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role. For more information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-dashboard-only-mode.html[Kibana Dashboard Only Mode].

Sharing::
* Add label and clear link to color picker {pull}12422[#12422]
* Expose the variables for dynamically building doc links {pull}12513[#12513]
* Reactify stateless table components {pull}12349[#12349]
* Full screen mode implementation for dashboard {pull}12265[#12265]
  - You can now enter full screen mode when viewing a dashboard. This hides the Chrome and the top nav bar.  If you have any filters applied, you'll see the filter bar, otherwise that will be hidden as well.  To exit full screen mode, hover over and click the Kibana button on the lower left side of the page, or simple press the ESC key.

Visualize::
* Visualize Refactor {pull}11786[#11786]
  - When creating new visualizations, developers are no longer restricted to using just Angular as a rendering technology. The changes now also enables developers to create custom editors that do not conform to the current sidebar-layout. Commonly used functionality - such as access to the query bar or timefilter - is now also exposed on the visualization object. This avoids the need to import individual modules from inside Kibana. These changes are a first step in a longer term effort to provide a robust long-lived programming interface for building visualizations in Kibana.
* Replace "marked" with "markdown-it" {pull}13623[#13623]
* Upgrade kibana to leaflet 1.x {pull}12367[#12367]
* Duration Formatting for TSVB {pull}13337[#13337]

* [Fix for #11193] hide current time marker when the timespan doesn't include the current time {pull}12266[#12266]
  - Only display current time marker on  a visualization when the x-axis extent includes the current time.
* [Fix for #7040] Add github-markdown.css to markdown visualization {pull}12377[#12377]

* Add imports for SavedObjectRegistryProvider.register, fixing Timelion {pull}12844[#12844]
* [Fix for #7572] add polygon drawing tool {pull}11578[#11578]
  - On a coordinate map, users can now make a selection on the map by drawing a freehand polygon. Just like the earlier boundary selection, this adds a boundary filter to the filter bar.

== {kib} 6.0.0-rc1

[float]
=== Breaking Changes

Management::
* [indexPatterns] remove support for time patterns {pull}12158[#12158]
  - - Removes ability to create index patterns based on time patterns/intervals  - Adds a warning that informs users when they are using an index pattern that is now unsupported (disabled by default until #10442 is done, #12322)  - Does not address editing/remapping index patterns, see last task in #12242

Operations::
* Updates to status API, re-align status page {pull}10180[#10180]
* [Fixes #10181] Revert same port http -&gt; https redirect {pull}10930[#10930]
  - Kibana 5.x redirected requests from http to https on the same port if TLS was configured. Starting in Kibana 6.0.0 Kibana no longer redirects basic http traffic to https.

Other::
* [Fixes #13096] Remove highlight query {pull}13231[#13231]

Platform::
* [Fixes #12012] Fail to start if settings include unknown keys {pull}12554[#12554]
  - When a config file includes invalid keys or values, Kibana usually logs a message describing the issue and fails to start. There has been an exception to this rule since 4.2 that allowed top-level keys to be unknown/misspelled and only caused a warning to be logged. That exception has been removed and now any unknown or misspelled config key passed to Kibana (via the config file or command line flags) will prevent it from starting.

Visualization::
* [Fixes #10907] allows more flexible timelion queries {pull}10961[#10961]

[float]
=== New Features

Operations::
* Use single ES document type {pull}12794[#12794]
  - Starting in Elasticsearch 6.0, you are no longer able to create new indices
  with multiple index types. To accomplish the same effect as index types, a new
  type field was added to identify the document and the value mapped under the
  index to allow for strict mapping.

[float]
=== Enhancements

Design::
* [UI Framework] Reactify menu {pull}12135[#12135]
* [UI Framework] reactify prompt for items {pull}12151[#12151]
* [UI Framework] Allow custom placeholder for Tool Bar Search Box {pull}12959[#12959]

Discover::
* [Fixes #4785] Timepicker on the right {pull}11980[#11980]
* [Fixes #12635]  Improve the accessibility of the Discover screen {pull}12681[#12681]

* Sets ES mapping to single_type=false {pull}11451[#11451]

Platform::
* [Fixes #10863] [uiSettings] support defining settings with uiExports {pull}12250[#12250]
  - - define a uiExports.uiSettingDefaults key your plugin definition to add uiSettingDefaults - uiSettingDefaults must be unique. If a key is already defined elsewhere then the server will not start. - defined settings will display in the advanced settings editor, along with the intended default value and description - the REST API is identical to before - the browser API is identical to before - defaults for timelion have been extracted to the timelion plugin definition and the existing defaults are defined in the kibana plugin definition
* [Fixes #12012] Refactor commaList filter logic into common util {pull}12553[#12553]
* [kbnServer/extensions] formalize request factories with helper {pull}12697[#12697]

* [Fixes #7572] add polygon drawing tool {pull}11578[#11578]
  - On a coordinate map, users can now make a selection on the map by drawing a freehand polygon. Just like the earlier boundary selection, this adds a boundary filter to the filter bar.
* [Fixes #12491, #12904, #12887] Improve accessibility of visualizations {pull}13507[#13507]
* [Fixes #11856, #12888, #12900] Improve accessibility of visualization view {pull}13726[#13726]

* [Fix for #13425] Replace "marked" with "markdown-it" {pull}13623[#13623]

[float]
=== Enhancements

Dashboard::
*  If you had a chance to check out the new Dashboard Only Mode in 6.0.0-beta1,
we've changed things up a bit for 6.0.0-beta2. Previously we required you to
flag every role a user belonged to as being in the View dashboards only mode
in order for that user to be flagged as a Dashboard only mode user. In this
new set up, we created a reserved role, `kibana_dashboard_only_user`, that is
already pre-configured with read only access to the .kibana index, and set up
to be in Dashboard Only Mode. All you have to add is this one role to any user
and they will now be a Dashboard Only Mode user. We also got rid of this new
setting in the Roles UI, as this one role should suffice for most user's setups.
If you have a more complicated setup, such as multi-tenancy with multiple
`.kibana` indexes, you can create more dashboard only mode roles by adding
role names to the `xpackDashboardMode:roles` advanced setting. For more
information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-dashboard-only-mode.html[Kibana Dashboard Only Mode].

Management::
* [Management] Provide a way to fetch index pattern titles {pull}13030[#13030]
  - This PR adds another method to the indexPatterns service to fetch index patterns titles. Since the code was nearly identical to how index pattern ids are fetched, I decided to slightly refactor the function to accept a parameter for which property to fetch from the index pattern. I've updated all usages to the new approach.
* [Fix for #11526, #8225] Move build info from management section to status page {pull}13341[#13341]

Monitoring::
* Added a tip in the pipeline viewer in {kib} when a pipeline contains a plugin
that does not have an id explicitly set in its configuration options. If you
specify an ID, you can track differences across pipeline changes. For more
information, see

Platform::
* [Fix for #12933] [chrome/nav/lastUrl] do not track redirect routes {pull}13432[#13432]
  - When you navigate to a URL that Kibana doesn't recognize it tries to be helpful and send you to discover. At the same time it tries to remember the URL you were last using in each app and bring back where you left off when you come back. Unfortunately, these two features recently collided. If you somehow ended up at an unknown URL that looked like the URL for an app other than discover Kibana would get confused and remember the bad URL and immediately redirect you to discover. If you didn't give up right away you would probably try to go back to the app, but since it Kibana is trying to be helpful it would send you right back to the bad URL and then back to discover... Stupid right?! Well, it won't happen anymore!

[[release-notes-6.0.0-beta1]]
== {kib} 6.0.0-beta1

[float]
=== Breaking Changes

Management::
* [indexPatterns] remove support for time patterns {pull}12158[#12158]
  - - Removes ability to create index patterns based on time patterns/intervals  - Adds a warning that informs users when they are using an index pattern that is now unsupported (disabled by default until #10442 is done, #12322)  - Does not address editing/remapping index patterns, see last task in #12242

Operations::
* Updates to status API, re-align status page {pull}10180[#10180]
* [Fix for #10181] Revert same port http -> https redirect {pull}10930[#10930]
  - Kibana 5.x redirected requests from http to https on the same port if TLS was configured. Starting in Kibana 6.0.0 Kibana no longer redirects basic http traffic to https.

Platform::
* [Fix for #12012] Fail to start if settings include unknown keys {pull}12554[#12554]
  - When a config file includes invalid keys or values, Kibana usually logs a message describing the issue and fails to start. There has been an exception to this rule since 4.2 that allowed top-level keys to be unknown/misspelled and only caused a warning to be logged. That exception has been removed and now any unknown or misspelled config key passed to Kibana (via the config file or command line flags) will prevent it from starting.
* Remove the es_admin proxy {pull}13000[#13000]
* Restrict ES data proxy to msearch and search {pull}13020[#13020]

Reporting::
* When {security} is enabled, reports will only be accessible to the user that created them.
* When {security} is enabled, user authorization is controlled by the
`xpack.reporting.roles.allow` setting in the `kibana.yml` which defaults to
`['reporting_user']`. Users will no longer have access to the underlying {reporting}
indices in {es} when assigned to the built-in `reporting_user` role. If using
custom reporting roles, the privileges to the indices will need to be removed, and the
role will need to be added to the `xpack-reporting.roles.allow` setting.

Visualization::
* [Fix for #10907] allows more flexible timelion queries {pull}10961[#10961]

[float]
=== New Features

Discover::
* Implement new Kibana query language {pull}12624[#12624]
  - This PR adds a new experimental query language to Kibana. The new language is turned off by default but can be enabled in the Management > Advanced Settings via the search:queryLanguage:switcher:enable option. Changing this setting to true will add a language selector to the query bar that allows users to choose the new language for their query. Details of the new query language can be found in the issue description (#12282).

Sharing::
* Full screen mode implementation for dashboard {pull}12265[#12265]
  - You can now enter full screen mode when viewing a dashboard. This hides the Chrome and the top nav bar.  If you have any filters applied, you'll see the filter bar, otherwise that will be hidden as well.  To exit full screen mode, hover over and click the Kibana button on the lower left side of the page, or simple press the ESC key.

Visualization::
* Visualize Refactor {pull}11786[#11786]
  - When creating new visualizations, developers are no longer restricted to using just Angular as a rendering technology. The changes now also enables developers to create custom editors that do not conform to the current sidebar-layout. Commonly used functionality - such as access to the query bar or timefilter - is now also exposed on the visualization object. This avoids the need to import individual modules from inside Kibana. These changes are a first step in a longer term effort to provide a robust long-lived programming interface for building visualizations in Kibana.

* [Management] Provide a way to fetch index pattern titles {pull}13030[#13030]
  - This PR adds another method to the indexPatterns service to fetch index patterns titles. Since the code was nearly identical to how index pattern ids are fetched, I decided to slightly refactor the function to accept a parameter for which property to fetch from the index pattern. I've updated all usages to the new approach.
* Add breadcrumb-page-title to management-app {pull}12765[#12765]
  - The bread-crumbs component allows for the consumer to pass in a page-title value which is appended as the final breadcrumb in the chain. This PR adds a scope argument to the management-app to take advantage of it.

* Adding ability to configure grid for TSVB {pull}12385[#12385]
* Adding option for controlling if last bucket is dropped for TSVB {pull}12379[#12379]
  - This PR creates an option in "Panel Options" and the metric index pattern override to allow the user to control if the last bucket should be dropped. By default TSVB will drop the last bucket since most of the time it's incomplete. This also changes the method for dropping the last bucket to a more reliable method.

* [Fix for #11193] hide current time marker when the timespan doesn't include the current time {pull}12266[#12266]
