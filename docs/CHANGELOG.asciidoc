.Importing and copying saved objects causes weak links to break
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
{kib} supports weak links in some saved objects. For example, a dashboard may include a Markdown panel that contains a relative URL to
another dashboard. Weak links are defined by free text, _not_ the saved object's relationships, and can break if **both** of the following
conditions are true:

* You are importing saved objects into multiple spaces, _OR_ you are copying saved objects into another space
* Before you upgraded to 8.0.0, the saved objects did not already exist in the destinations

In 8.0.0 and later, weak links break because <<saved-object-ids-impact-when-using-import-and-copy,saved object IDs can change during import or copy>>.
This applies to both the UI and the API.
This issue will be fixed 8.0.1 and 8.1.0. For more information, refer to {kibana-issue}123550[#123550].

*Impact* +
Saved objects in 7.x that are migrated during upgrade are **not** impacted.
Only _new_ saved objects that are imported or copied _multiple times_ (causing object IDs to change) are impacted.
If you are impacted, you can re-import or re-copy your saved objects after the fix is
implemented to preserve the weak links.

.Removed `/api/security/v1/saml` route
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `/api/security/v1/saml` route has been removed and is reflected in the kibana.yml `server.xsrf.whitelist` setting, {es}, and the Identity Provider SAML settings. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}47929[#47929]

.Reject legacy browsers by default
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
To provide the maximum level of protection for most installations, the csp.strict config is now enabled by default. Legacy browsers not supported by Kibana, such as Internet Explorer 11, are unable to access {kib} unless explicitly enabled. All browsers officially supported by Kibana do not have this issue. For more information, refer to {kibana-pull}41700[#41700]

*Impact* +
To enable support for legacy browsers, set `csp.strict: false` in kibana.yml. To effectively enforce the security protocol, we strongly discourage disabling `csp.strict` unless it is critical that you support Internet Explorer 11.
