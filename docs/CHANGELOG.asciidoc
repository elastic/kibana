=== K7 UI Design

{kib} 7.0.0-alpha1 includes a new design for {kib} called K7. In this early stage, 
K7 is still a little rough around the edges. If you'd like to switch back to the 
existing K6 design, go to *Management > Advanced Settings* and turn 
off the *k7design* setting. The option to switch to the old design 
will be removed before 7.0.0 GA.
