[[release-notes-6.8.15]]
== {kib} 6.8.15

The 6.8.15 release includes the following bug fix.

Security::
* Fixes session idle timeout {kibana-pull}91070[#91070]

[[release-notes-6.8.14]]
== {kib} 6.8.14

The 6.8.14 release includes a security update and fixes one issue. 

[float]
[[security-update-v6.8.14]]
=== Security update
*Vega* visualizations are susceptible to stored and reflected XSS via a vulnerable version of the Vega library. When you create *Vega* visualizations or create a vulnerable URL that describes the visualization, an arbitrary JavaScript can execute in your browser.

[float]
[[affected-versions-v6.8.14]]
==== Affected versions
Affected versions include 6.8.13 and earlier.

[float]
[[solution-v6.8.14]]
==== Solution
Verify if you use *Vega* visualizations, then complete the following:

* If you use *Vega* visualizations, upgrade to 6.8.14.

* If you do not use *Vega* visualizations, open your kibana.yml file, then change `vega.enabled: true` to `vega.enabled: false`.

[float]
[[bug-v6.8.14]]
=== Bug fix
Reporting::
* Fixes an issue where a failed request in the headless browser running the screenshot capture would log an obscured error {kibana-pull}88118[#88118]

[[release-notes-6.8.13]]
== {kib} 6.8.13

There are no user-facing changes.

[[release-notes-6.8.12]]
== {kib} 6.8.12

For the 6.8.12 release, there are no user-facing changes.

[[release-notes-6.8.11]]
== {kib} 6.8.11

[float]
[[security-update-6.8.11]]
=== Security updates
* In {kib} 6.8.10 and earlier, there is a denial of service (DoS) flaw in Timelion. Attackers can construct a URL that when viewed by a {kib} user, 
the {kib} process consumes large amounts of CPU and becomes unresponsive,
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7016[CVE-2020-7016].
+
You must upgrade to 6.8.11. If you are unable to upgrade, set `timelion.enabled` to `false` in your kibana.yml file to disable Timelion.

* In all {kib} versions, region map visualizations contain a stored XSS flaw. Attackers that can edit or create region map visualizations can obtain 
sensitive information or perform destructive actions on behalf of {kib} users who view the region map visualization,
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7017[CVE-2020-7017].
+
You must upgrade to 6.8.11. If you are unable to upgrade, set `xpack.maps.enabled`, `region_map.enabled`, and `tile_map.enabled` to `false` in kibana.yml to disable map visualizations.

[float]
[[enhancement-v6.8.11]]
=== Enhancements
Platform::
* Makes SameSite cookie's attribute configurable {kib-pull}68108[#68108]
Security::
* Supports deep links inside of `RelayState` for SAML IdP initiated login {kib-pull}69401[#69401]
+
If users want to deep link into {kib} after a successful SAML Identity Provider initiated login,
they can set `xpack.security.authc.providers.saml.<provider-name>.useRelayStateDeepLink`
for a specific SAML authentication provider and provide a deep link in the `RelayState` parameter.

[float]
[[bug-v6.8.11]]
=== Bug fixes
Maps::
* Loads configuration from EMS-metadata in region-maps {kib-pull}70888[#70888]
Security::
* Redirects to Logged Out UI on SAML Logout Response {kib-pull}69676[#69676]
+
Previously {kib} redirected users to a default location as the last step of
a SAML User/SP Initiated Single Logout (SP SLO), which forced users to log in again
when the Login Selector UI was not available. Now, {kib} redirects users to either
the Login Selector UI or the Logged Out UI at the end of SP SLO.

[[release-notes-6.8.10]]
== {kib} 6.8.10

[float]
[[security-update-6.8.10]]
=== Security update
In {kib} 5.4.0 and later, TSVB visualizations contain a stored XSS flaw. Attackers that can
edit and create TSVB visualizations can obtain sensitive information, or perform
destructive actions, on behalf of the {kib} users who edit the TSVB visualization, CVE-2020-7015.

You must upgrade to 6.8.10. If you are unable to upgrade, set `metrics.enabled:false` in your kibana.yml file to disable TSVB.

[[release-notes-6.8.9]]
== {kib} 6.8.9

[float]
[[security-update-6.8.9]]
=== Security updates
* In 6.7.0 to 6.8.8, the Upgrade Assistant contains a prototype pollution flaw. An authenticated attacker with
privileges to write to the {kib} index can insert data that could cause {kib} to execute arbitrary code. This
could lead to an attacker executing code with the permissions of the {kib} process on the host system, CVE-2020-7012.
+
By default, the Upgrade Assistant flaw is mitigated in all {kib} instances accessed through {ess}.
+
For all other installations, you must upgrade to 6.8.9. If you are unable to upgrade, disable the Upgrade Assistant in your kibana.yml file:

** In 6.7.0 and 6.7.1, set `upgrade_assistant.enabled:false`
** In 6.7.2 and later, set `xpack.upgrade_assistant_enabled:false`

* In 6.8.9 and earlier, TSVB contains a prototype pollution flaw. Authenticated attackers with privileges to create
TSVB visualizations can insert data that could cause {kib} to execute arbitrary code. This
could lead to an attacker executing code with the permissions of the {kib} process on the host system, CVE-2020-7013.
+
By default, the Upgrade Assistant flaw is mitigated in all {kib} instances accessed through {ess}.
+
For all other installations, you must upgrade to 6.8.9. If you are unable to upgrade, set `metrics.enabled:false` in your kibana.yml file to disable TSVB.

[float]
[[enhancement-6.8.9]]
=== Enhancement
Security::
* Adds a message to the login screen {kib-pull}64158[#64158]
+
This message is good for displaying information about maintenance windows,
links to corporate sign up pages, and so on.


[[release-notes-6.8.8]]
== {kib} 6.8.8

[float]
[[enhancement-6.8.8]]
=== Enhancement
Security::
* {kib} now allows Identity Provider initiated SAML login even if saml authentication provider is not configured as the first one in xpack.security.authProviders {kib-pull}60240[#60240]

[float]
[[bug-6.8.8]]
=== Bug fix
Security::
* {kib} now automatically re-initiates login when session access/refresh token pair used for Token and SAML authentication is removed from Elasticsearch (typically after 24 hours of user inactivity) {kib-pull}33777[#33777]

[[release-notes-6.8.7]]
== {kib} 6.8.7

[float]
[[bug-6.8.7]]
=== Bug fixes
Operations::
* Updates Node.js to version 10.19.0 {kib-pull}56940[#56940]
Platform::
* Limits fetching index patterns {kib-pull}56603[#56603]

[float]
[[security-fix-6.8.7]]
=== Security issues
In {kib} 6.8.7 and earlier, Node.js contains the following security issues:

* The TLS handling code for Node.js includes a Denial of Service (DoS) issue. Successful exploitation of the flaw could result in {kib} crashing. Refer to https://www.elastic.co/community/security/, CVE-2019-15604.
+
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

* There are issues with how Node.js handles malformed HTTP headers. The malformed headers could result in an HTTP request smuggling attack when {kib} is running behind a proxy that is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling attacks. Refer to https://www.elastic.co/community/security/, CVE-2019-15605 and CVE-2019-15606.
+
For instructions on how to mitigate HTTP request smuggling attacks, contact your proxy vendor.

Administrators running {kib} in an environment with untrusted users should upgrade to {kib} 6.8.7, which updates Node.js to 10.19.0.

[[release-notes-6.8.6]]
== {kib} 6.8.6

[float]
[[bug-6.8.6]]
=== Bug fix
Maps::
* Fixes a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in Coordinate and Region Map
visualizations. An attacker could create a malicious visualization that
executes JavaScript in a victim’s browser when the visualization, or dashboard
containing the visualization, was viewed. Since Kibana 6.7.0, Content Security
Policy (CSP), which prevents attackers from using this flaw, is enabled by
default. However, an attacker can still inject arbitrary HTML into the page.
See https://www.elastic.co/community/security/, CVE-2019-7621.
* Sanitizes attribution {kib-pull}52309[#52309]


[[release-notes-6.8.5]]

=== Known issues

* {kib} gets stuck when upgrading from an older version
+
After upgrading from an older version of {kib} while using {security}, if you get a permission error when you start {kib} for the first time, do the following steps to recover:
+
1. Stop Kibana
2. Delete the `.kibana_1` and `.kibana_2` indices that were created
3. Create a new role in Elasticsearch that has `create_index`, `create`, and `read` permissions for the .tasks index
4. Create a new user in Elasticsearch that has the `kibana_system` role as well as the new role you just created
5. Update `elasticsearch.username` and `elasticsearch.password` in kibana.yml with the details from that new user
6. If using a Kibana secure settings keystore, remove keys `elasticsearch.username` and `elasticsearch.password` from the keystore using the `kibana-keystore` tool. Add these keys back to the keystore using the new user and password as values.
7. Start Kibana
+
This will be fixed in a future bug fix release, at which time you can go back to using the built-in `kibana` user.

* {kib} ignores the timezone setting `dateFormat:tz` {kib-pull}25596[#25596]
+
If you use the default `browser` setting for `dateFormat:tz`,
you're fine. If you use any other setting for `dateFormat:tz`, and you use
Absolute time ranges, you might see issues where {kib} initially
shows data in your browser's local timezone instead of the configured timezone.
Refreshing the page usually corrects the issue.
This will be fixed in a future bug fix release.

* {kib} errors when setting `logging.useUTC` in kibana.yml.
+
The setting is meant to be deprecated, and using the replacement setting `logging.timezone` can be used as a workaround.

[float]
[[deprecation-6.5.0]]
=== Deprecations

Monitoring::
* Deprecates `xpack:defaultAdminEmail` for monitoring alerts {kib-pull}22195[#22195]
+
The `xpack:defaultAdminEmail` UI Setting is deprecated for Monitoring, but is still
fully supported for the Watcher UI. To receive cluster alert notification emails,
configure `xpack.monitoring.cluster_alerts.email_notifications.email_address` in `kibana.yml`.

[float]

[[enhancement-6.5.0]]
=== Enhancements

Discovery::
* Allows Kibana users to configure the `max_concurrent_shard_requests` param used by Kibana when sending `_msearch requests`. The configuration is exposed as an advanced setting. By default the parameter is not sent, relying on the Elasticsearch default instead. {kib-pull}22379[#22379]

Kibana Home &amp; Add Data::
* Allows sample data set to install multiple indices {kib-pull}23230[#23230]
* Adds an optional `now` query parameter that allows installing sample data at a fixed point in time {kib-pull}20678[#20678]
* Adds an "Uptime Monitors" box to the Metrics tab. This box guides users through installing and configuring Heartbeat and loading the dashboards. {kib-pull}23995[#23995]

* Adds Canvas workpad for sample data {kib-pull}24347[#24347]

Kibana Application::
* Changes courier so that instead of emitting Elasticsearch errors, which originate with the Elasticsearch client, it will emit `SearchError`. This uncouples error-handling from the internal strategy courier uses to send search requests. {kib-pull}23382[#23382]
* Adds an option to always present a certificate when connecting to Elasticsearch using `elasticsearch.ssl.alwaysPresentCertificate: true` {kib-pull}24304[#24304]

* Disables auto focus on job wizard select index and search page {kib-pull}21913[#21913]
* Adds `aria-label` to calendar and jobs list buttons {kib-pull}21922[#21922]
* Adds validation to the label and time range when editing custom URLs in the Jobs List flyout. {kib-pull}21960[#21960]
* Adds links to rule editor for quick edit of value or filter {kib-pull}22990[#22990]
* Removes the job ID from the detector description to avoid duplication {kib-pull}23192[#23192]
* Moves the “Add custom URL” button and form to the top of the editor {kib-pull}23326[#23326]
* Adds indicators for multi-bucket anomalies to the charts and anomalies table in the Single Metric Viewer and Anomaly Explorer dashboards {kib-pull}23746[#23746]
* Sets focus to the “View results” link on the Job wizards (Single metric, Multi metric, and Population job types) when the job starts running and when the job finishes {kib-pull}24190[#24190]
* Introduces custom charts for detectors that use a `rare`  function (Event Distribution Chart) as well as detectors that use an `over` field (Population Distribution Chart) {kib-pull}23423[#23423]
* Adds validation for the model memory limit value  {kib-pull}21270[#21270]
* Adds a group selection menu to the jobs management page {kib-pull}21780[#21780]
* Enables support for the `rare` detector for the charts in Anomaly Explorer and Single Metric Viewer {kib-pull}21524[#21524]
* Migrates the Explorer Charts to React {kib-pull}22622[#22622]
* Migrates Anomaly Explorer Swimlanes to React {kib-pull}22641[#22641]
* Tweaks the design of the Explorer Chart to more clearly visualize how the time range of the cell selected in the swimlane relates to the time span shown in the charts {kib-pull}22955[#22955]
* Enables the display of contextual data for population charts using other metrics than `count` {kib-pull}24083[#24083]

Management::
* Adds opt in for telemetry to start trial and upload license screens {kib-pull}22925[#22925]
* Adds a home page section for rollups that links to the rollup jobs CRUD UI {kib-pull}24421[#24421]
* Polishes the Index Management UI {kib-pull}21979[#21979]
* Makes the width of the import saved objects dialog narrower so it doesn't obscure the UI {kib-pull}22011[#22011]
* Adds ingest node updates for auto-complete in console {kib-pull}24100[#24100]
* Adds autocomplete rules for CCR to Kibana console. Also fixes an issue with the documentation link URL manipulation {kib-pull}24739[#24739]

Monitoring::
* Adds a monitoring UI for APM {kib-pull}22975[#22975]

* Adds new K7 header navigation as an optional UI {kib-pull}23300[#23300]

Reporting::
* Adds ability to disable polling for idle jobs {kib-pull}24295[#24295]
+
A new `kibana.yml` config setting, `xpack.reporting.queue.pollEnabled`, can be set to `false` (default is `true`) to stop the {kib} instance from running polling workers to claim and execute reporting jobs. This makes it possible to configure a Kibana instance to only act as a Reporting worker, and other instances to do everything for Reporting (queuing, listing, provide downloads, and so on) except for executing reporting jobs.

Sharing::
* Implements Inspect panel for saved searches {kib-pull}22376[#22376]

Visualizations::
* Adds support for `format:number:defaultLocale` and `format:number/bytes/percent:defaultPattern` settings in Time Series Visual Builder {kib-pull}21444[#21444]
* Introduces date histogram time base configuration to EditorConfig.  This is needed to support rollups in Kibana. {kib-pull}22344[#22344]

[[release-notes-6.4.0]]
== {kib} 6.4.0

[float]
[[breaking-6.4.0]]
=== Breaking Changes

Platform::
* Replaces `SearchSource` fetch with `fetchAsRejectablePromise` {kib-pull}20130[#20130]
+
`SearchSource` exposed two methods for fetching, `fetch` and `fetchAsRejectablePromise`.
`fetch` provided a broken implementation because it never set an `errorHandler` on
the created `SearchRequest` instance. This resulted in a method that worked fine
until the underlying {es} request failed. Then {kib} would crash because
`SearchRequest` would attempt to call `errorHandler` which was undefined.
+
The only difference between `fetch` and `fetchAsRejectablePromise` was how errors
were handled. This change removes the original fetch method and renames
`fetchAsRejectablePromise` as fetch. It also moves `errorHandler` into
the constructor of `SearchRequest` and throws an error when not provided.

When using {xpack}, it was previously possible for {kib} to get stuck in a "red"
state, preventing access to the {kib} applications, if {kib} and {es} were
started at the same time. We've fixed this issue to ensure that {kib} is always

[[release-notes-6.3.0]]
== {kib} 6.3.0

[float]
[[breaking-6.3.0]]
=== Breaking Changes

Operations::
+
As of Kibana 6.3.0, X-Pack is bundled by default in the default distribution.
Existing X-Pack users should remove the plugin before upgrading.
+
There is a known issue preventing `bin/kibana-plugin` from removing the pre-existing
plugin after upgrading. This will be resolved in 6.3.1. If you happen to encounter this issue,
there are a few options:
+
* **Uninstall the plugin before upgrading:** `bin/kibana-plugin remove x-pack`
* **Uninstall the plugin after upgrading:** Manually delete the `plugins/x-pack` directory.

Platform::
* Renames saved objects bulk_get and find endpoints {kib-pull}17512[#17512]
+
To support sending larger and more expressive queries to the Saved Objects find
API, we added a POST endpoint for find and therefore needed a way to disambiguate
the find API from from the POST API used to create Saved Objects.
+
Starting in {kib} 6.3, endpoints that are not simple CRUD operations on a single
object will be named and their name will start with an underscore. For example,
{es} `GET /api/saved_objects` is now `GET /api/saved_objects/_find`,
`GET /api/saved_objects/{type}` is now `GET /api/saved_objects/_find?type={type}`,
and `GET /api/saved_objects/bulk_get` is now `GET /api/saved_objects/_bulk_get`.

[float]
=== New Features

For an overview of the features that were added in 6.3 and how the user experience
improved, see <<release-highlights-6.3.0, 6.3.0 Release Highlights>>.

[float]
=== Enhancements

Machine learning::
* You can now use {ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[cross cluster search]
in the {ml} features in {kib}. If you have configured a cross cluster index
pattern in {kib}, you can use that index pattern when you create jobs.

Platform::
* Angular was upgraded to version 1.6.9 {kib-pull}17677[#17677]


[float]
=== Bug Fixes

Accessibility::
* [Fixes #19009] Adds alt text to the icons on the home page for accessibility

* Fixes an issue with autocomplete in the console {kib-pull}17678[#17678]
+
Endpoint definitions are expected to have unique names, and the code was using
the same name for endpoints with overloaded HTTP verb semantics. This code fixes
those names by adding a timestamp.

Monitoring::
* Changes the Advanced Node page for {es} to recognize the `write` threadpool
{kib-pull}18147[#18147]

Operations::
* [Fixes #6688] Adds support for environment variable injection in the

+
This fix resolves the issue with the index pattern APIs not responding with
WWW-Authenticate headers on 401s. This caused basic authentication via {kib} to not
work properly in some configurations.

=== Regressions

Management::

* In 6.2.4, if users edit a watch or a logstash pipeline and navigate away from
the page without saving, a confirmation modals asks if they want to save the
changes. In 6.3, the prompt was disabled to fix {kib-pull}19488[#19488] and

Reporting::
* By default, weekly `.reporting` indices created after upgrading to 6.2 use a
single primary shard and have the `auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather
than a fixed setting of 1 replica. As a result, these indices can have a green
status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node clusters.

* [Fixes #14456] [Accessibility] Improve filter bar accessibility {kib-pull}14474[#14474]

Machine Learning::
* Added the ability to create and display forecasts for {ml} jobs in {kib}.
* Simplified job creation for certain recognizable data sources, such as
Filebeat access logs from Nginx and Apache HTTP servers.
* Added a Data Visualizer, which enables you to learn more about the
characteristics of your data and identify fields for {ml} analysis. For more
information, see <<ml-jobs>>.
* Added bucket span to the chart labels in the Single Metric Viewer.
* Added support for job groups when managing jobs in {kib}.
* Added the ability to show or hide the Anomaly Explorer charts by selecting a
checkbox. The choice is saved in the URL, so it persists if you re-open the
view from a bookmarked URL.
* Added a new job creation wizard for population jobs, which detect activity
that is unusual compared to the behavior of the population. For more information,
see {ml-docs}/ml-configuring-pop.html[Performing population analysis].
* Added the ability to control the maximum number of rows in the Anomaly
Explorer view by swimlane, with options of `5`, `10`, `25`, or `50`. Previously,
it was fixed to a maximum of 10 rows.
* Changed the job creation wizards such that you select an index pattern or
saved search before you select the type of job.
* Added licensing checks to the job creation features in {kib}. If the license
is expired, for example, the create job, edit job, clone job, and start {dfeed}
buttons are disabled.

more information about the `model_memory_limit` property, see
{ref}/ml-job-resource.html#ml-apilimits[Job Resource Analysis Limits].
* Added a **Close Job** button that enables you to force the closure of a job
when it fails. The button is disabled if the job is running, closed, or does not
have a {dfeed}.
* Added the ability to display jobs with multiple detectors in the Single Metric
Viewer when the `model_plot_config` property is enabled. Previously, this
functionality was only possible for jobs with a single detector.

Management::
* [Fixes #12867] &quot;Create index pattern&quot; wizard.  {kib-pull}13454[#13454]
  - Introducing a new wizard to create index patterns that makes index discovery and matching much easier than before.
* [Fixes #12668] add an option for url types so that it can be opened in current tab (master branch) {kib-pull}13209[#13209]

* Add rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; to external links {kib-pull}14440[#14440]

Monitoring::
* Added Cross Cluster Search (CCS) to efficiently retrieve monitoring data from
local and remote clusters.
* Improved handling of health check errors. If there is a problem making a query,
for example, an error is returned and extra information is provided in the logs.
As part of this change, the `monitoring` plugin for {kib} will never cause {kib}
to go `red`.
* Improved logging when X-Pack is not installed on the monitoring cluster.
* Saved table interaction states such that if you leave the {kib} page and
subsequently return, your filters persist.

Reporting::
* Added support for a HTTP Proxy to be configured when using Chromium as the
browser. For more information, see <<reporting-chromium-settings>>.
* Added headless build of Chromium that can be used instead of PhantomJS for
capturing Reporting screenshots. To enable Chromium, set the following setting
in your `kibana.yml` file: `xpack.reporting.capture.browser.type: chromium`. For
now PhantomJS will remain the default. In the future, however, Chromium will
become the default.
* Added an option for PDF reports that preserves the existing layout and size of
the Visualization or Dashboard.

Security::
* Added `manage_index_templates` cluster privileges to the `kibana_system` role,
which enables the {kib} system user to create and manage the index template for
the `.kibana` index. For more information, see
{ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges] and
{ref}/built-in-roles.html[Built-in roles].

Admins can now also setup Kibana to opt-out of connection to the Elastic Maps Service. Users can now opt-out of having the visualization display warnings.
* Introduce lab mode for visualizations {kib-pull}15050[#15050]
  - Newly introduced visualizations can now be part of labs-mode. Visualizations in labs-mode introduce new more cutting-edge functionality and can be subject to change across minor releases.  Labs-mode can be turned off in the advanced settings. Labs-visualization will then no longer be available to the user. The Time Series Visual Builder is not part of labs-mode, it continues to be an experimental feature. The input controls are the first to be flagged as a lab visualization.
* reverts metric visualization {kib-pull}14052[#14052]
  - The metric visualization now no longer reuses the rendering code of the gauge and goal visualizations. This improves consistency of positioning of the metric on Dashboards.

* Fixed scenarios where clicking the "View examples" link in the Anomalies
section of the Single Metric Viewer or Anomaly Explorer caused the browser to hang.
* Fixed scenarios where the Anomaly Explorer or Single Metric Viewer failed to
plot metric data in the charts due to a blank field name in a detector. This
problem was specific to jobs that were originally created in 5.4.

Management::
* [Fixes #12612] Create keyboard mode for ui-ace editor {kib-pull}13339[#13339]
  - Our code editor in several places won't trap keyboard focus anymore, by using the Tab key. When navigating by keyboard, you first need to Enter editing mode in the code editor and you can leave it by pressing Escape.

Monitoring::
* Fixed problems viewing pipelines in {kib} from a Firefox web browser.
For more information, see
{logstash-ref}/logstash-pipeline-viewer.html[Pipeline Viewer UI].
* The `xpack.monitoring.node_resolver` setting, which was deprecated in 5.5.0,
now allows only the `uuid` value to be used. This setting will be removed in 7.0.

* [Fixes #9523] Fix issue where saved searches are not updated {kib-pull}14452[#14452]
  - There has been a long standing issue where if you add a saved search to a dashboard, then go edit and save that saved search, the updates are not propagated to the dashboard.  The only way, previously, to get the new changes was to remove and re-add the search from your dashboard. With this fix, that is no longer necessary. However, there is one situation when your saved search will stop updating and that is when someone has made and saved local edits to the saved search on the dashboard.  For example, if you remove a column from a saved search in a dashboard panel, then save the dashboard, that search will always show that column set, even if columns are added or removed to the underlying saved search. We did it this way to still allow users to override the configuration at the dashboard level.

[[security-6.0.1]]
=== Security Issues

* ​Kibana cross site scripting issue (ESA-2017-22): Kibana versions prior to 6.0.1 and 5.6.5 had a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via URL fields that could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of other Kibana users. CVE ID: CVE-2017-11481

* Kibana open redirect flaw (ESA-2017-23) : The Kibana fix for CVE-2017-8451 was found to be incomplete. With X-Pack installed, Kibana versions before 6.0.1 and 5.6.5 have an open redirect vulnerability on the login page that would enable an attacker to craft a link that redirects to an arbitrary website. CVE ID: CVE-2017-11482

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 6.0.1 or 5.6.5. There are no known workarounds for these issues.

Platform::
* Fix fieldFormat plugins {kib-pull}14984[#14984]
  - In 6.0.0 we accidentally included a breaking change that prevented plugins from supplying custom FieldFormatters. This has been fixed but, also changes the way that they need to be defined. Take a look at the field formatters Kibana supplies to see how you should update your custom FieldFormats.

[[release-notes-6.0.0]]
== {kib} 6.0.0

[float]
=== Breaking Changes

Reporting::
* When {security} is enabled, reports will only be accessible to the user that created them.
* When {security} is enabled, user authorization is controlled by the
`xpack.reporting.roles.allow` setting in the `kibana.yml` which defaults to
`['reporting_user']`. Users will no longer have access to the underlying {reporting}
indices in {es} when assigned to the built-in `reporting_user` role. If using
custom reporting roles, the privileges to the indices will need to be removed, and the
role will need to be added to the `xpack-reporting.roles.allow` setting.

Security::
* The built-in users (`elastic`, `kibana`, and `logstash_system`) no longer have
default passwords. You must create passwords for these users and configure {kib}
to use this information. For more information, see
{ref}/setting-up-authentication.html[User authentication].

Watcher::
* The built-in HTTP client used in webhooks, the http input and the http email attachment has been replaced.
This results in the need to always escape all parts of an URL.
* The new built-in HTTP client also enforces a maximum request size, which defaults to 10mb.
* The watch `_status` field has been renamed to `status`, as underscores in
field names will not be allowed.

[float]
=== Enhancements

Core::
* Remove legacy pre-4.2 configurations {kib-pull}12013[#12013]
* NODE_ENV no longer has an impact on Kibana {kib-pull}12010[#12010]
* Only support 64 bit operating systems {kib-pull}11941[#11941]
* Remove field_stats pre-flight option for index patterns {kib-pull}12814[#12814]
* [Fixes #13439] Upgrade Angular to 1.6.5 {kib-pull}13543[#13543]

Dashboard::
*  If you had a chance to check out the new Dashboard Only Mode in 6.0.0-beta1,
we've changed things up a bit for 6.0.0-beta2. Previously we required you to
flag every role a user belonged to as being in the View dashboards only mode
in order for that user to be flagged as a Dashboard only mode user. In this
new set up, we created a reserved role, `kibana_dashboard_only_user`, that is
already pre-configured with read only access to the .kibana index, and set up
to be in Dashboard Only Mode. All you have to add is this one role to any user
and they will now be a Dashboard Only Mode user. We also got rid of this new
setting in the Roles UI, as this one role should suffice for most user's setups.
If you have a more complicated setup, such as multi-tenancy with multiple
`.kibana` indexes, you can create more dashboard only mode roles by adding
role names to the `xpackDashboardMode:roles` advanced setting. For more
information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-dashboard-only-mode.html[Kibana Dashboard Only Mode].

Design::
* Palette swap for accessibility / kibana 6 {kib-pull}12085[#12085]

Discover::
* Implement new Kibana query language {kib-pull}12624[#12624]
  - This PR adds a new experimental query language to Kibana. The new language is turned off by default but can be enabled in the Management > Advanced Settings via the search:queryLanguage:switcher:enable option. Changing this setting to true will add a language selector to the query bar that allows users to choose the new language for their query. Details of the new query language can be found in the issue description (#12282).
* Remove highlight query {kib-pull}13231[#13231]
* [Fixes #12635]  Improve the accessibility of the Discover screen {kib-pull}12681[#12681]
* [Fixes #12343] Remove custom keyboard navigation in datepicker {kib-pull}13644[#13644]
* Accessible sort buttons {kib-pull}12217[#12217]
* [Accessibility] Avoid empty th in doc-table header row {kib-pull}12364[#12364]
  - The discover document table header cells provide appropriate hints to screen-readers.
* [Accessibility] Add button to skip past the discover doc table {kib-pull}12539[#12539]
  - The new "Skip to bottom"-button in Discover is invisible unless focused. When activated it displays all remaining rows that were already loaded and focuses an anchor located below the table.
* Timepicker on the right {kib-pull}11980[#11980]

Machine Learning::
* Added a Datafeed Preview tab to expanded rows in the jobs list under
Job Management. This displays the JSON response from the preview endpoint.
* Added an option to create a watch when you start a {dfeed} in {kib}. After the
{dfeed} starts, you are prompted to specify details such as the interval and the
anomaly severity threshold. If {watcher} is disabled, this option does not appear.
* Updated the bucket span estimator, which suggests bucket span values when you
create jobs in {kib}. The estimator now suggests a minimum bucket span value
of 15 minutes.

Management::
* [indexPatterns] remove support for time patterns {kib-pull}12158[#12158]
  - Removes ability to create index patterns based on time patterns/intervals  - Adds a warning that informs users when they are using an index pattern that is now unsupported (disabled by default until #10442 is done, #12322)  - Does not address editing/remapping index patterns, see last task in #12242
* [Fix for #11526, #8225] Move build info from management section to status page {kib-pull}13341[#13341]
* [Management] Provide a way to fetch indices and template index patterns {kib-pull}12200[#12200]
* [Management] More universal solution for fetching indices and aliases {kib-pull}12405[#12405]
* Add breadcrumb-page-title to management-app {kib-pull}12765[#12765]
  - The bread-crumbs component allows for the consumer to pass in a page-title value which is appended as the final breadcrumb in the chain. This PR adds a scope argument to the management-app to take advantage of it.

Monitoring::
* The Logstash Pipeline viewer in {kib} displays an information icon and a
corresponding tip for every plugin that does not define an ID explicitly.
Defining an ID for plugins enables you to track differences across pipeline
changes. For more information, see
{logstash-ref}/logstash-pipeline-viewer.html[Pipeline Viewer UI].
* Added an alert in clusters that have trial licenses and have enabled {security}
but do not have TLS/SSL configured. The message provides information about the
steps that are required to enable {security} when they obtain a non-trial license.
* Added support for cluster alerts, for example to provide information about
license expiration.
* Added an advanced setting for a default admin e-mail, which is the recipient
of {xpack} admin operations such as cluster alert e-mail notifications.

Operations::
* Updates to status API, re-align status page {kib-pull}10180[#10180]
* [Fix for #10181] Revert same port http -> https redirect {kib-pull}10930[#10930]
  - Kibana 5.x redirected requests from http to https on the same port if TLS was configured. Starting in Kibana 6.0.0 Kibana no longer redirects basic http traffic to https.
* Update mappings for kibana index {kib-pull}9280[#9280]
* Use single ES document type {kib-pull}12794[#12794]
  - Starting in Elasticsearch 6.0, you are no longer able to create new indices with multiple index types. To accomplish the same effect as index types, a new type field was added to identify the document and the value mapped under the index to allow for strict mapping.
* [logging] Downgrade hapi connection errors when connecting with the w… {kib-pull}11209[#11209]
* [status] 15m load average should use the 3rd index {kib-pull}11202[#11202]
* [Fixes #9436] [optimizer] remove support for .jsx extension {kib-pull}12712[#12712]
* Sets ES mapping to single_type=false {kib-pull}11451[#11451]

Platform::
* [Fix for #12012] Fail to start if settings include unknown keys {kib-pull}12554[#12554]
  - When a config file includes invalid keys or values, Kibana usually logs a message describing the issue and fails to start. There has been an exception to this rule since 4.2 that allowed top-level keys to be unknown/misspelled and only caused a warning to be logged. That exception has been removed and now any unknown or misspelled config key passed to Kibana (via the config file or command line flags) will prevent it from starting.
* Remove the es_admin proxy {kib-pull}13000[#13000]
* Restrict ES data proxy to msearch and search {kib-pull}13020[#13020]
* [server/indexPatterns] expose indexPatternService getter/factory {kib-pull}13012[#13012]
* Remove client-side management of Kibana index mappings {kib-pull}12820[#12820]
* Uses uuid for auto-generated ids and prepends type (#12834) {kib-pull}12877[#12877]
* [uiSettings] support defining settings with uiExports {kib-pull}12250[#12250]
  - define a uiExports.uiSettingDefaults key your plugin definition to add uiSettingDefaults - uiSettingDefaults must be unique. If a key is already defined elsewhere then the server will not start. - defined settings will display in the advanced settings editor, along with the intended default value and description - the REST API is identical to before - the browser API is identical to before - defaults for timelion have been extracted to the timelion plugin definition and the existing defaults are defined in the kibana plugin definition
* Refactor commaList filter logic into common util {kib-pull}12553[#12553]
* [kbnServer/extensions] formalize request factories with helper {kib-pull}12697[#12697]
* Allow plugins to turn off the "link to last URL" navigation helper {kib-pull}13044[#13044]

Reporting::
* Enabled export as CSV.

Security::
* Added a View Dashboards Only setting to the roles section under
Security management. If a user is assigned a role that has this setting
enabled, when they access Kibana it presents Dashboard Only mode.
* Added reserved `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role. For more information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-dashboard-only-mode.html[Kibana Dashboard Only Mode].

Sharing::
* Add label and clear link to color picker {kib-pull}12422[#12422]
* Expose the variables for dynamically building doc links {kib-pull}12513[#12513]
* Reactify stateless table components {kib-pull}12349[#12349]
* Full screen mode implementation for dashboard {kib-pull}12265[#12265]
  - You can now enter full screen mode when viewing a dashboard. This hides the Chrome and the top nav bar.  If you have any filters applied, you'll see the filter bar, otherwise that will be hidden as well.  To exit full screen mode, hover over and click the Kibana button on the lower left side of the page, or simple press the ESC key.

Visualize::
* Visualize Refactor {kib-pull}11786[#11786]
  - When creating new visualizations, developers are no longer restricted to using just Angular as a rendering technology. The changes now also enables developers to create custom editors that do not conform to the current sidebar-layout. Commonly used functionality - such as access to the query bar or timefilter - is now also exposed on the visualization object. This avoids the need to import individual modules from inside Kibana. These changes are a first step in a longer term effort to provide a robust long-lived programming interface for building visualizations in Kibana.
* Replace "marked" with "markdown-it" {kib-pull}13623[#13623]
* Upgrade kibana to leaflet 1.x {kib-pull}12367[#12367]
* Duration Formatting for TSVB {kib-pull}13337[#13337]

* [Fix for #7572] add polygon drawing tool {kib-pull}11578[#11578]
  - On a coordinate map, users can now make a selection on the map by drawing a freehand polygon. Just like the earlier boundary selection, this adds a boundary filter to the filter bar.

[[release-notes-6.0.0-rc1]]
== {kib} 6.0.0-rc1

[float]
=== Breaking Changes

Management::
* [indexPatterns] remove support for time patterns {kib-pull}12158[#12158]
  - - Removes ability to create index patterns based on time patterns/intervals  - Adds a warning that informs users when they are using an index pattern that is now unsupported (disabled by default until #10442 is done, #12322)  - Does not address editing/remapping index patterns, see last task in #12242

Operations::
* Updates to status API, re-align status page {kib-pull}10180[#10180]
* [Fixes #10181] Revert same port http -&gt; https redirect {kib-pull}10930[#10930]
  - Kibana 5.x redirected requests from http to https on the same port if TLS was configured. Starting in Kibana 6.0.0 Kibana no longer redirects basic http traffic to https.

Other::
* [Fixes #13096] Remove highlight query {kib-pull}13231[#13231]

Platform::
* [Fixes #12012] Fail to start if settings include unknown keys {kib-pull}12554[#12554]
  - When a config file includes invalid keys or values, Kibana usually logs a message describing the issue and fails to start. There has been an exception to this rule since 4.2 that allowed top-level keys to be unknown/misspelled and only caused a warning to be logged. That exception has been removed and now any unknown or misspelled config key passed to Kibana (via the config file or command line flags) will prevent it from starting.

Visualization::
* [Fixes #10907] allows more flexible timelion queries {kib-pull}10961[#10961]

[float]
=== New Features

Operations::
* Use single ES document type {kib-pull}12794[#12794]
  - Starting in Elasticsearch 6.0, you are no longer able to create new indices
  with multiple index types. To accomplish the same effect as index types, a new
  type field was added to identify the document and the value mapped under the
  index to allow for strict mapping.

[float]
=== Enhancements

Design::
* [UI Framework] Reactify menu {kib-pull}12135[#12135]
* [UI Framework] reactify prompt for items {kib-pull}12151[#12151]

=== Breaking Changes

Discover::
* [Fix for #13096] Remove highlight query {kib-pull}13231[#13231]

Visualization::

[float]
=== Enhancements

Dashboard::
*  If you had a chance to check out the new Dashboard Only Mode in 6.0.0-beta1,
we've changed things up a bit for 6.0.0-beta2. Previously we required you to
flag every role a user belonged to as being in the View dashboards only mode
in order for that user to be flagged as a Dashboard only mode user. In this
new set up, we created a reserved role, `kibana_dashboard_only_user`, that is
already pre-configured with read only access to the .kibana index, and set up
to be in Dashboard Only Mode. All you have to add is this one role to any user
and they will now be a Dashboard Only Mode user. We also got rid of this new
setting in the Roles UI, as this one role should suffice for most user's setups.
If you have a more complicated setup, such as multi-tenancy with multiple
`.kibana` indexes, you can create more dashboard only mode roles by adding
role names to the `xpackDashboardMode:roles` advanced setting. For more
information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-dashboard-only-mode.html[Kibana Dashboard Only Mode].

Discover::
* [Fix for #12343] Remove custom keyboard navigation in datepicker {kib-pull}13644[#13644]

Management::
* [Management] Provide a way to fetch index pattern titles {kib-pull}13030[#13030]
  - This PR adds another method to the indexPatterns service to fetch index patterns titles. Since the code was nearly identical to how index pattern ids are fetched, I decided to slightly refactor the function to accept a parameter for which property to fetch from the index pattern. I've updated all usages to the new approach.
* [Fix for #11526, #8225] Move build info from management section to status page {kib-pull}13341[#13341]

Monitoring::
* Added a tip in the pipeline viewer in {kib} when a pipeline contains a plugin
that does not have an id explicitly set in its configuration options. If you
specify an ID, you can track differences across pipeline changes. For more
information, see
{logstash-ref}/logstash-pipeline-viewer.html[Pipeline Viewer UI].

Platform::
* [server/indexPatterns] expose indexPatternService getter/factory {kib-pull}13012[#13012]

Security::
* Added reserved `kibana_dashboard_only_user` role. For more information, see

Platform::
* [Fix for #12933] [chrome/nav/lastUrl] do not track redirect routes {kib-pull}13432[#13432]
  - When you navigate to a URL that Kibana doesn't recognize it tries to be helpful and send you to discover. At the same time it tries to remember the URL you were last using in each app and bring back where you left off when you come back. Unfortunately, these two features recently collided. If you somehow ended up at an unknown URL that looked like the URL for an app other than discover Kibana would get confused and remember the bad URL and immediately redirect you to discover. If you didn't give up right away you would probably try to go back to the app, but since it Kibana is trying to be helpful it would send you right back to the bad URL and then back to discover... Stupid right?! Well, it won't happen anymore!

[[release-notes-6.0.0-beta1]]
== {kib} 6.0.0-beta1

[float]
=== Breaking Changes

Management::
* [indexPatterns] remove support for time patterns {kib-pull}12158[#12158]
  - - Removes ability to create index patterns based on time patterns/intervals  - Adds a warning that informs users when they are using an index pattern that is now unsupported (disabled by default until #10442 is done, #12322)  - Does not address editing/remapping index patterns, see last task in #12242

Operations::
* Updates to status API, re-align status page {kib-pull}10180[#10180]
* [Fix for #10181] Revert same port http -> https redirect {kib-pull}10930[#10930]
  - Kibana 5.x redirected requests from http to https on the same port if TLS was configured. Starting in Kibana 6.0.0 Kibana no longer redirects basic http traffic to https.

Platform::
* [Fix for #12012] Fail to start if settings include unknown keys {kib-pull}12554[#12554]
  - When a config file includes invalid keys or values, Kibana usually logs a message describing the issue and fails to start. There has been an exception to this rule since 4.2 that allowed top-level keys to be unknown/misspelled and only caused a warning to be logged. That exception has been removed and now any unknown or misspelled config key passed to Kibana (via the config file or command line flags) will prevent it from starting.
* Remove the es_admin proxy {kib-pull}13000[#13000]
* Restrict ES data proxy to msearch and search {kib-pull}13020[#13020]

Reporting::
* When {security} is enabled, reports will only be accessible to the user that created them.
* When {security} is enabled, user authorization is controlled by the
`xpack.reporting.roles.allow` setting in the `kibana.yml` which defaults to
`['reporting_user']`. Users will no longer have access to the underlying {reporting}
indices in {es} when assigned to the built-in `reporting_user` role. If using
custom reporting roles, the privileges to the indices will need to be removed, and the
role will need to be added to the `xpack-reporting.roles.allow` setting.

Visualization::
* [Fix for #10907] allows more flexible timelion queries {kib-pull}10961[#10961]

[float]
=== New Features

Discover::
* Implement new Kibana query language {kib-pull}12624[#12624]
  - This PR adds a new experimental query language to Kibana. The new language is turned off by default but can be enabled in the Management > Advanced Settings via the search:queryLanguage:switcher:enable option. Changing this setting to true will add a language selector to the query bar that allows users to choose the new language for their query. Details of the new query language can be found in the issue description (#12282).

Sharing::
* Full screen mode implementation for dashboard {kib-pull}12265[#12265]
  - You can now enter full screen mode when viewing a dashboard. This hides the Chrome and the top nav bar.  If you have any filters applied, you'll see the filter bar, otherwise that will be hidden as well.  To exit full screen mode, hover over and click the Kibana button on the lower left side of the page, or simple press the ESC key.

Visualization::
* Visualize Refactor {kib-pull}11786[#11786]
  - When creating new visualizations, developers are no longer restricted to using just Angular as a rendering technology. The changes now also enables developers to create custom editors that do not conform to the current sidebar-layout. Commonly used functionality - such as access to the query bar or timefilter - is now also exposed on the visualization object. This avoids the need to import individual modules from inside Kibana. These changes are a first step in a longer term effort to provide a robust long-lived programming interface for building visualizations in Kibana.

* [Design] Use alpha logo, retain branding in fullscreen mode {kib-pull}12735[#12735]
* [Fix for #12622] [Design] Update favicons {kib-pull}12774[#12774]

Dev Tools::
* Respects ES customHeaders config for Console {kib-pull}13033[#13033]

Discover::
* Accessible sort buttons {kib-pull}12217[#12217]
* [Accessibility] Avoid empty th in doc-table header row {kib-pull}12364[#12364]
  - The discover document table header cells provide appropriate hints to screen-readers.
* [Accessibility] Add button to skip past the discover doc table {kib-pull}12539[#12539]
  - The new "Skip to bottom"-button in Discover is invisible unless focused. When activated it displays all remaining rows that were already loaded and focuses an anchor located below the table.
* Timepicker on the right {kib-pull}11980[#11980]

Management::
* Uses SavedObjectsClient for UI Settings {kib-pull}12747[#12747]
* [Management] Provide a way to fetch indices and template index patterns {kib-pull}12200[#12200]
* [Management] More universal solution for fetching indices and aliases {kib-pull}12405[#12405]
* [Management] Provide a way to fetch index pattern titles {kib-pull}13030[#13030]
  - This PR adds another method to the indexPatterns service to fetch index patterns titles. Since the code was nearly identical to how index pattern ids are fetched, I decided to slightly refactor the function to accept a parameter for which property to fetch from the index pattern. I've updated all usages to the new approach.
* Add breadcrumb-page-title to management-app {kib-pull}12765[#12765]
  - The bread-crumbs component allows for the consumer to pass in a page-title value which is appended as the final breadcrumb in the chain. This PR adds a scope argument to the management-app to take advantage of it.

Operations::
* Update mappings for kibana index {kib-pull}9280[#9280]
* Saved objects compatibility layer {kib-pull}12648[#12648]
* Support v6 mappings for saved objects import/export {kib-pull}12792[#12792]
* Use single ES document type {kib-pull}12794[#12794]
  - Starting in Elasticsearch 6.0, you are no longer able to create new indices with multiple index types. To accomplish the same effect as index types, a new type field was added to identify the document and the value mapped under the index to allow for strict mapping.
* Add eslint import resolution {kib-pull}12025[#12025]
* [eslint] Ignore ui_framework/doc_site/build {kib-pull}12400[#12400]
* [logging] Downgrade hapi connection errors when connecting with the w… {kib-pull}11209[#11209]

* Adds bulk_get to SavedObjects {kib-pull}12426[#12426]
* Uses SavedObjects API in Courier Saved Object {kib-pull}12407[#12407]

Platform::
* Use SavedObjectsClient for Courier Index Pattern {kib-pull}12719[#12719]
* Document merge conflict resolution process in CONTRIBUTING.md. {kib-pull}12212[#12212]
* Update files_to_commit to find renamed files. {kib-pull}12423[#12423]

* add api tag to api routes {kib-pull}12948[#12948]
* Move Jest config to json {kib-pull}12402[#12402]
* [uiSettings] support defining settings with uiExports {kib-pull}12250[#12250]
  - - define a uiExports.uiSettingDefaults key your plugin definition to add uiSettingDefaults - uiSettingDefaults must be unique. If a key is already defined elsewhere then the server will not start. - defined settings will display in the advanced settings editor, along with the intended default value and description - the REST API is identical to before - the browser API is identical to before - defaults for timelion have been extracted to the timelion plugin definition and the existing defaults are defined in the kibana plugin definition
* Refactor commaList filter logic into common util {kib-pull}12553[#12553]
* [kbnServer/extensions] formalize request factories with helper {kib-pull}12697[#12697]
* Allow plugins to turn off the “link to last URL” navigation helper {kib-pull}13044[#13044]

Sharing::
* Uses SavedObjectsClient for Short URL Lookup {kib-pull}12787[#12787]
* Stats API {kib-pull}11992[#11992]
  - We introduced a new api endpoint at api/stats which displays counts of saved objects in your kibana index: {"dashboard":{"total":1},"visualization":{"total":3},"search":{"total":1},"index_pattern":{"total":1},"index":".kibana"}
* Add new react color picker to ui framework with tests {kib-pull}12245[#12245]

Visualization::
* Fix ui-select error border color and placeholder font color. {kib-pull}12411[#12411]
* Fix appearance of error indicator in Visualize sidebar.  {kib-pull}12410[#12410]
* Adding ability to configure grid for TSVB {kib-pull}12385[#12385]
* Adding option for controlling if last bucket is dropped for TSVB {kib-pull}12379[#12379]
  - This PR creates an option in "Panel Options" and the metric index pattern override to allow the user to control if the last bucket should be dropped. By default TSVB will drop the last bucket since most of the time it's incomplete. This also changes the method for dropping the last bucket to a more reliable method.
* Fixes #12602 - Change TSVB Fields API to use fieldCaps API {kib-pull}12611[#12611]
* [Fix for #11193] hide current time marker when the timespan doesn't include the current time {kib-pull}12266[#12266]
  - Only display current time marker on  a visualization when the x-axis extent includes the current time.

* [Fix for #7572] add polygon drawing tool {kib-pull}11578[#11578]
  - On a coordinate map, users can now make a selection on the map by drawing a freehand polygon. Just like the earlier boundary selection, this adds a boundary filter to the filter bar.
* Visualize refactor (bis) {kib-pull}12715[#12715]
