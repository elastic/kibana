[[using-kibana-for-the-first-time]]
== 10 Minute Walk Through
Kibana is a great tool for real time data analytics and simply being on
this page has put you on your way to making the most of it! If you have
not downloaded Kibana yet, you can get it here:
http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/installation/[Download
Kibana]. We recommend you start this tutorial with a clean Elasticsearch
instance.

By the end of this document you will have:

* Imported some data
* Tried out the sample dashboard
* Searched your data
* Configured Kibana to point only at your new index instead of all
indices

We will assume you have already:

* Installed Elasticsearch on your workstation
* Have webserver installed on your workstation and have the distribution
extracted into the configured document root.
* You are familiar with the UNIX command line and have used `curl`

[[import-some-data]]
=== Import some data


We will be using the entire collected works of Shakespeare as our
example data. In order to make the best use of Kibana you will likely
want to apply a mapping to your new index. Let's create the shakespeare
index with the following mapping. Our data with have more fields than
this, but these are the ones we want to explicitly map. Specifically we
do not want to analyze 'speaker' and 'play_name'. You'll see why later
on.

Run in a terminal:

[source,json]
----------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/shakespeare -d '
{
 "mappings" : {
  "_default_" : {
   "properties" : {
    "speaker" : {"type": "string", "index" : "not_analyzed" },
    "play_name" : {"type": "string", "index" : "not_analyzed" },
    "line_id" : { "type" : "integer" },
    "speech_number" : { "type" : "integer" }
   }
  }
 }
}
';
----------------------------------------------------------------

Great, we've created the index. Now we want to import the data. You can
download the entire works of shakespeare in elasticsearch bulk import
format here: link:./snippets/shakespeare.json[shakespeare.json]

Import it into your local elasticsearch instance the following command.
This may take a few minutes. Shakespeare wrote a lot of stuff!

[source,shell]
---------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_bulk --data-binary @shakespeare.json
---------------------------------------------------------------

[[accessing-the-kibana-interface]]
=== Accessing the Kibana interface
Now that you have data, let's do something with it. Point your browser
at your local webserver, the one with Kibana already installed.

If you have Kibana extracted to your
document root you will be presented with this lovely welcome page. Click
*Sample Dashboard*

image:./tutorials/intro/sample_shakespeare.png[Sample Dashboard] And there you have your
sample dashboard! Now if you started with a clean elasticsearch instance
you'll see a very heavily weighted pie chart. This represents the type
of documents in your index. As you can see, 99% them are lines for
characters, with only a few denoting acts and scenes.

Below that you will see a long list of JSON formatted lines of
shakespeare.

[[the-first-search]]
=== The first search
Kibana allows you to search Elasticsearch data via the Lucene Query
String syntax. Queries can be run via the query input at the top of the
page image:./tutorials/intro/query.png[Sample Dashboard]

Type this in the query bar. Then check out the first few rows of the
table.

[source,shell]
---------------------------
friends, romans, countrymen
---------------------------

For more information on queries see link:./working-with-queries-and-filters.html[Queries and Filters]

[[configuring-another-index]]
=== Configuring another index
Right now Kibana is pointing at the special Elasticsearch index `_all`.
Think of `_all` as a composite index that points at all of your indices.
Right now you only have one, `shakespeare`, but you might have more
someday and we don't want Kibana searching all of that data if you're
only looking for your favorite line from Macbeth.

To configure the the index click the configure icon in the top right:

image:./tutorials/intro/configicon.png[Sample Dashboard]

From here, you can set your index to `shakespeare` and ensure that
Kibana only searches the `shakespeare` index

=== Next steps
Congratulations, you've installed and configured kibana and dipped your
toes in the water. Next, check out some of our videos and other
tutorials for more advanced usage. Now you can try adding your own panels
to a blank dashboard. For more information on queries see
link:./rows-and-panels.html[Rows and Panels]
