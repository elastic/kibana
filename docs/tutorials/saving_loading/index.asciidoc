== Saving and Loading
You've built an amazing dashboard! Now you want to share it with your
team, maybe turn on auto-refresh and put it up on a big screen? Kibana
can persist dashboard designs to Elasticsearch and allow you to recall
them via the load menu or links.

=== Saving your awesome dashboard
Saving your flashy new interface is as easy as opening the save drop
down by clicking the *Save* icon in the upper righthand corner. Give
your new dashboard a name and hit _enter_. Now your dashboard has been
saved to a special Elasticsearch index called `kibana-int`

[[recalling-your-dashboard]]
=== Recalling your dashboard
To search a list of your saved dashboards click the *Load* icon in the
upper righthand corner. From here you can load, share and remove
dashboards.

[[sharing-dashboards]]
=== Sharing dashboards
Saved dashboards can be shared via the URL in your brower's navigation
bar. Dashboards persisted to Elasticsearch will have a URL that points
to them, such as:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------
http://your_host/index.html#/dashboard/elasticsearch/MYDASHBOARD
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this example `MYDASHBOARD` is the title we have given the dashboard
when saving.

You can also share links to adhoc dashboards by generating a temporary
URL to them by clicking the *Share* icon in the upper righthand corner
of Kibana.

By default these temporary URLs live for 30 days.

[[saving-a-static-dashboard]]
=== Saving a static dashboard
Dashboards can also be saved to disk on your server as .json files.
Place them in the `app/dashboards` directory and access them via

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------------------
http://your_host/index.html#/dashboard/file/MYDASHBOARD.json
------------------------------------------------------------

Where `MYDASHBOARD.json` is the name of the file on disk. Note the path
`/#dashboard/file/` appears similar to the above path for accessing
Elasticsearch stored dashboards, but in this case we are accessing a
file instead of elasticsearch. For information on exporting the
dashboard schema to a file see link:./_dashboard_schema.html[The
Dashboard Schema Explained]

=== Next steps
Now that you know how to save dashboards, how to load them and how to
access them on disk you might be interested in passing them parameters
via the URL so you can programatically make links to data from other
applications. See link:./templated-and-scripted-dashboards.html[Templated and
Scripted Dashboards]
