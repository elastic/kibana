[[rows-and-panels]]
== Rows and Panels
Kibana's dashboards are organized into a system of rows and panels.
These can be added, removed and rearranged to suite your needs.

In this section we will cover:

* Loading a blank dashboard
* Adding, sizing and hiding rows
* Adding and sizing panels
* Removing panels and rows

We will assume you have already:

* Installed Elasticsearch on your workstation
* Have webserver installed on your workstation and have the distribution
extracted into the configured document root.
* Have read link:./using-kibana-for-the-first-time.html[Using Kibana for the first time]
and have the `shakespeare` index populated with the data from the
tutorial.

[[loading-a-blank-dashboard]]
=== Loading a blank dashboard
image:./tutorials/rows_panels/home.png[home screen]

From the homescreen, select option #3, this will load a Blank Dashboard.
By default, the blank dashboard is configured to look at Elasticsearch's
`_all` index, which points to all of your indices. If you would like to
configure Kibana to point at a different index, see
link:./using-kibana-for-the-first-time.html[Using Kibana for the first time]

[[adding-a-row]]
=== Adding a row
image:./tutorials/rows_panels/Addingrow.png[Adding a row]

Your new blank dashboard will appear with the query and filter sections
expanded, a time filter input in the navigation bar at the top, and not
a whole lot else. Click the *Add a row* button on the right to add your
first row.

image:./tutorials/rows_panels/addedrow.png[Adding a row]

Give your row a title and click *Create Row*. You will see your new row
appear in the list of rows to the left. Click *Save*

[[the-row-controls]]
=== The row controls

Now that you have a row, you will notice a few new elements on your
dashboard. Chiefly the 3 brightly colored rectangles to the left. Move
the mouse over them

image:./tutorials/rows_panels/buttons_expanded.png[Row buttons]

Ah hah! these buttons allow you to accomplish 3 things

* Collapsing rows (blue)
* Configuring rows (orange)
* Adding panels (green)

[[adding-panels]]
=== Adding panels
For now we'll focus on the _green_ button in the row controls. Give it a
try. You can also click the _grey_ button labeled *Add panel to empty
row*, but it's grey, and what fun is that?

image:./tutorials/rows_panels/addpanel.png[Add panel]

Let's add a *terms* panel. The *terms* panel allows us to make use of
the Elasticsearch *terms facet* to find the most popular values in a
field.

image:./tutorials/rows_panels/terms_settings.png[Add panel]

As you can see, the terms panel has a number of optional settings,
however we'll focus on the general settings in the first section for
now:

1.  Title: The name for this panel
2.  Span: The width of the panel. Kibana dashboards are made of 12
equally sized _spans_. Panels can be up to 12 spans wide. Rows can
contain more than a total of 12, with new panels wrapping to the next
line. Leave this at 4 for now.
3.  Editable: If this panel is configurable later. Leave this checked
for now.
4.  Inspectable: If the user can view the query used for this panel.
Also leave this checked for now.
5.  Click *Save* to add your new *terms* panel to your dashboard

Great! Now you have a panel! You may recognize this breakdown of data
from the pie chart in link:./using-kibana-for-the-first-time.html[Using Kibana for the first time]. The `shakespeare` data set is comprised largely of lines of
speech, with a few markers between acts and scenes thrown in there.

[[collapsing-and-expanding-rows]]
=== Collapsing and expanding rows
image:./tutorials/rows_panels/buttons_expanded.png[Row buttons]

The blue button collapses your rows. Panels in collapsed rows do not
refresh data and thur require no Elasticsearch resources to keep around.
Collapsed rows are great for data that you don't need to see often.
Click the blue button again to expand the row.

image:./tutorials/rows_panels/collapsed.png[Collapsed row]

The query and filter sections at the top can also be collapsed. Click
the colored label to collapse and expand

image:./tutorials/rows_panels/toprowscollapsed.png[Collapsed top row]

[[editing-rows]]
=== Editing rows
Rows can be renamed, resized and edited via the row editor. Click the
orange cog icon button to open the row editor.

image:./tutorials/rows_panels/roweditor.png[Row edit]

The same dialog also allows you to change the order and size of panels,
as well as remove them.

[[moving-and-removing-panels]]
=== Moving and Removing panels
Panels can be dragged and dropped within their own row, or into another
row, by dragging the crosshair shaped move icon in the top right of the
panel.

image:./tutorials/rows_panels/movepanel.png[Removing Panels]

Click the _remove_ icon in the top right of a panel to remove it from
the dashboard. Panels can also be removed from the row editor.

image:./tutorials/rows_panels/removing_panels.png[Removing Panels]

[[moving-and-removing-rows]]
=== Moving and Removing Rows
Rows can be re-ordered and removed via the dashboard configuration
screen. Click the cog in the top left of the screen, and select the
*Rows* tab to make changes to the row layout. You may remember this
screen from when we added our first row.

image:./tutorials/rows_panels/rowmove.png[Removing Rows]

The arrows to the left allow you to change the order of the rows on your
dashboard. The *X* is used to remove rows.

=== Next steps
Before you close your browser you might want to save this new dashboard.
