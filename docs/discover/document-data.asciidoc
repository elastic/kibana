[[document-data]]
== Viewing document data

When you submit a search query in *Discover*, the most recent documents that match the query
are listed in the documents table. 
From this table, you can dig into and understand your data 
before you visualize it. This saves you time in creating your visualizations 
and helps improve the quality of your dashboards.

=== Add, sort, and remove fields from the document table

By default, the document table includes columns for two fields: the 
localized version of the time field for the selected index 
pattern and the document _source. Use the following commands to 
tailor the documents table to meet your needs.

[horizontal]
Add a field column:: 
Hover over the list of *Available fields* and then click *add* next to each field you want include in the table.
The first column you add replaces the _source column. 
Change sort order:: By default, columns are sorted by the values in the field.  
If a time field is configured for the current index pattern, 
the documents are sorted in reverse chronological order.  To change the sort order, hover over the column 
and click image:images/sort-icon.png[] 
Move a field column:: Hover over the column header and click the move left or move right icon image:images/move-icon.png[]. 
Remove&nbsp;a&nbsp;field&nbsp;column&nbsp;:: Hover over the list of *Specified fields* 
and then click *remove* next to each. 
Or, use the control in the column header.

=== Drill down into field-level details
To view the field data for a document, click the Expand icon.
You can view field data in either Table or JSON format. 

The expanded view provides these options for viewing your document:

* For filtering options, hover over a row in the Table view.

* View the events that surround your document, click <<document-context, Context view>>
For example, you might want to see the 10 documents that occurred 
immediately before and after your event.  

* View the document data as a separate page. You can bookmark and 
share the link for direct access to a particular document.
