[[document-data]]
== Viewing Document Data

When you submit a search query, the 500 most recent documents that match the query are listed in the Documents table.
You can configure the number of documents shown in the table by setting the `discover:sampleSize` property in
<<advanced-options,Advanced Settings>>. By default, the table shows the localized version of the time field specified
in the selected index pattern and the document `_source`. You can <<adding-columns, add fields to the Documents table>>
from the Fields list. You can <<sorting, sort the listed documents>> by any indexed field that's included in the table.

To view a document's field data, click the *Expand* button image:images/ExpandButton.jpg[Expand Button] to the left of
the document's entry in the first column (the first column is usually Time). Kibana reads the document data from
Elasticsearch and displays the document fields in a table. The table contains a row for each field that contains the
name of the field, add filter buttons, and the field value.

[[sorting]]
=== Sorting the Document List
You can sort the documents in the Documents table by the values in any indexed field. Documents in index patterns that
are configured with time fields are sorted in reverse chronological order by default.

To change the sort order, click the name of the field you want to sort by. The fields you can use for sorting have a
sort button to the right of the field name. Clicking the field name a second time reverses the sort order.

[[adding-columns]]
=== Adding Field Columns to the Documents Table
By default, the Documents table shows the localized version of the time field specified in the selected index pattern
and the document `_source`. You can add fields to the table from the Fields list or from a document's expanded view.

To add field columns to the Documents table:

. Mouse over a field in the Fields list and click its  *add* button image:images/AddFieldButton.jpg[Add Field Button].
. Repeat until you've added all the fields you want to display in the Documents table.
. Alternately, add a field column directly from a document's expanded view by clicking the
image:images/add-column-button.png[Add Column] *Toggle column in table* button.

The added field columns replace the `_source` column in the Documents table. The added fields are also
listed in the *Selected Fields* section at the top of the field list.

To rearrange the field columns in the table, mouse over the header of the column you want to move and click the *Move*
button.

button image:images/RemoveFieldButton.jpg[Remove Field Button].
. Repeat until you've removed all the fields you want to drop from the Documents table.
