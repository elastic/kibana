[[document-data]]
== Viewing document data

When you submit a search query in *Discover*, the most recent documents that match the query
are listed in the documents table. 
By default, the table includes columns for 
the time field and the document _source, or all fields and values in the document.
Although the table contains all the details, it can be difficult to parse the default format.
You can narrow the context of the table to reveal hidden insights and patterns.

=== Add and remove fields from the document table

Use the following commands to 
tailor the documents table to show specific events.

Click the 
arrow to expand the row to view the details in table or JSON format.

Add a field column:: 
Hover over the list of *Available fields* and then click *add* next to each field you want include in the table.
The first column you add replaces the _source column.  
Change sort order:: By default, columns are sorted by the values in the field.  
If a time field is configured for the current index pattern, 
the documents are sorted in reverse chronological order.  To change the sort order, hover over the column 
and click image:images/sort-icon.png[] 
Move a field column:: Hover over the column header and click the move left (<<) or move right icon (>>). 
Remove&nbsp;a&nbsp;field&nbsp;column&nbsp;:: Hover over the list of *Specified fields* 
and then click *remove* next to each. 
Or, use the control in the column header.

=== Drill down into field-level details
To view the document data in either Table for JSON format, click the expand icon (>).
The expanded view provides these options for viewing your document:

* For filtering options, hover over a row in the Table view.

* To view the events that surround your document, click <<document-context, Context view>>
For example, you might want to see the 10 documents that occurred 
immediately before and after your event.  

* View the document data as a separate page. You can bookmark and 
share the link for direct access to a particular document.
