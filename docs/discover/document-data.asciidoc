[[document-data]]
== Viewing document data

When you submit a search query in *Discover*, the most recent documents that match the query
are listed in the documents table. 
From this table, you can dig into and understand your data 
before you visualize it. This saves you time in creating your visualizations 
and helps improve the quality of your dashboards.

[[sorting]]
=== Add, sort, move, and remove field columns

By default, the document table includes columns for two fields: the 
localized version of the time field for the selected index 
pattern and the document _source. Use the following commands to 
tailor the documents table to meet your use case.

[horizontal]
Add a field column:: 
Hover over the list of *Available fields* and then click *add* next to each field you want include.
The first column you add replaces the _source column in the Documents table. All added fields also appear in the *Selected Fields* list.
Change sort order:: By default, columns are sorted by the values in the field.  
If a time field is configured for the current index pattern, 
the documents are sorted in reverse chronological order.  To change the sort order, hover over the column and click ... 
Move a field column:: Hover over the column header and click move left or move right. 
Remove&nbsp;a&nbsp;field&nbsp;column&nbsp;:: Hover over the list of *Specified fields* 
and then click *remove* next to each. 
Or, use the control in the column header.

=== Drill down into field-level details

From the expanded view of the document table, you can 
view field data in either Table or JSON format. For filtering options, hover
over a row in the Table view.

The expanded document view also provides these options for viewing your document:

* Open a <<document-context, Context view>> that lists the events that
surround your document.  For example, you might want to see the 10 documents that occurred 
immediately before and after your event.  

* View the document data as a separate page. You can bookmark and 
share the link for direct access to a particular document.

in the table by setting the `discover:sampleSize` property in <<advanced-options,
Advanced Settings>>.
