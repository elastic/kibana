== Viewing document data

When you submit a search query in *Discover*, the most recent documents that match the query
are listed in the documents table.
By default, the table includes columns for
the time field and the document `_source`, which shows all fields and values in the document.

=== Modify the document table

Use the following commands to
tailor the documents table to suit your needs.

[horizontal]
Add a field column::
Hover over the list of *Available fields* and then click *add* next to each field you want to include as a column in the table.
The first field you add replaces the `_source` column.
Change sort order:: By default, columns are sorted by the values in the field.
If a time field is configured for the current index pattern,
the documents are sorted in reverse chronological order.
+
To change the sort order, hover over the column
and click image:images/sort-icon.png[].
The first click sorts by ascending order, the second click sorts by descending order, and the third
click removes the field from the sorted fields.

Move a field column:: Hover over the column header and click the (<<) or (>>) icons.
Remove&nbsp;a&nbsp;field&nbsp;column&nbsp;:: Hover over the list of *Specified fields*
and then click *remove*.
Or, use the (x) control in the column header.

=== Drill down into field-level details
To view the document data in either table or JSON format, click the expand icon (>).
The expanded view provides these options for viewing your document:

* View the events that surround your document.
For example, you might want to see the 10 documents that occurred
immediately before and after your event.

* View the document data as a separate page. You can bookmark and
share the link for direct access to a particular document.

=== Configure the number of documents to show

By default, the documents table includes the 500 most recent documents that
match the query. To change this number, set the `discover:sampleSize` property in <<advanced-options,
Advanced Settings>>.
