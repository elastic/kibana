[[discover-view-document]]
== View a document

Once you've found a document of interest in *Discover*, you have two more ways to view it: as a single document and in context with surrounding documents.

[float]
[[discover-view-single-document]]
=== View a single document

. In the document table, click the expand icon (>).
. Click **View single document**.
+
This allows you to view the document in two ways. **Table** displays the document's fields row by row.
**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) allows you to take a look at how the document is returned from Elasticsearch.

The link is valid for the time the document is available in Elasticsearch. If you need another way to view single
documents, you can extend **Table** and **JSON** by creating <<external-plugin-development, your own plugin>>.

[float]
[[discover-view-surrounding-documents]]
=== View surrounding documents

To view the surrounding documents, your index pattern must contain time-based events.

. In the document table, click the expand icon (>).
. Click **View surrounding documents**

Now you can inspect the documents that occurred immediately before and after the event.

Documents are sorted by the time field specified in the index pattern
and displayed using the same set of columns as the *Discover* view from which
the context was opened. The anchor document is highlighted in blue.

The filters you applied in *Discover* are carried over to the context view. Pinned 
filters remain active, while normal filters are copied in a disabled state.

. To find the documents of interest, add filters.

. To increase the number of documents that surround the anchor document, click *Load*.
By default, five documents are added with each click.

[float]
[[configure-context-ContextView]]
==== Configure the context view

Configure the appearance and behavior in *Advanced Settings*.

. Open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Advanced Settings*.
. Search for `context`, then edit the settings.
+
[horizontal]
`context:defaultSize`:: The number of documents to display by default.
`context:step`:: The default number of documents to load with each button click. The default is 5.
`context:tieBreakerFields`:: The field to use for tiebreaking in case of equal time field values.
The default is the `_doc` field.
+
You can enter a comma-separated list of field
names, which is checked in sequence for suitability when a context is
displayed. The first suitable field is used as the tiebreaking
field. A field is suitable if the field exists and is sortable in the index
pattern the context is based on.
+
Although not required, it is recommended to only
use fields that have {ref}/doc-values.html[doc values] enabled to achieve
good performance and avoid unnecessary {ref}/modules-fielddata.html[field
data] usage. Common examples for suitable fields include log line numbers,
monotonically increasing counters and high-precision timestamps.
