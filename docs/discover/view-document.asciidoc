[[discover-view-document]]
== View a document

Once you've found a document of interest in *Discover*, you have two more ways to
view it: in a view by itself or in context with surrounding documents.

[float]
[[discover-view-single-document]]
=== View a single document

Access a single document so you can bookmark it and share the link.

. In the document table, click the expand icon (>).
. In the expanded view, click **View single document**.
+
You can view the document in two ways. The **Table** view displays the document fields row-by-row.
The **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) view allows you to look at how {es} returns the document.

The link is valid for the time the document is available in Elasticsearch. To create a customized view of the document,
you can create <<external-plugin-development, your own plugin>>.

[float]
[[discover-view-surrounding-documents]]
=== View surrounding documents

To inspect the documents that occurred immediately before and after a document,
your {data-source} must contain time-based events.

. In the document table, click the expand icon (>).
. In the expanded view, click **View surrounding documents**.
+
Documents are displayed using the same set of columns as the *Discover* view from which
the context was opened. The filters you applied are also carried over. Pinned
filters remain active, while normal filters are copied in a disabled state.
