[[discover-view-document]]
== View a document

Once you've found a document of interest in *Discover*, you have two more ways to view it: as a single document and in context with surrounding documents.

[float]
[[discover-view-single-document]]
=== View a single document

. In the document table, click the expand icon (>).
. Click **View single document**.
+
You can view the document in two ways. The **Table** view displays the document fields row-by-row.
The **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) view allows you to look at how {es} returns the document.

The link is valid for the time the document is available in Elasticsearch. If you need to view a single document for 
a longer time, extend **Table** and **JSON** by creating <<external-plugin-development, your own plugin>>.

[float]
[[discover-view-surrounding-documents]]
=== View surrounding documents

To view the surrounding documents, your index pattern must contain time-based events.

. In the document table, click the expand icon (>).
. Click **View surrounding documents**
+
Now you can inspect the documents that occurred immediately before and after the event.

Documents are displayed using the same set of columns as the *Discover* view from which
the context was opened. The anchor document is highlighted in blue.

+
The filters you applied in *Discover* are carried over to the context view. Pinned 
filters remain active, while normal filters are copied in a disabled state.

. To find the documents of interest, add filters.

. To increase the number of documents that surround the anchor document, click *Load*.
By default, five documents are added with each click.

[float]
[[configure-context-ContextView]]
==== Configure the context view

Configure the appearance and behavior in *Advanced Settings*.

. Open the main menu, then click *Stack Management > Advanced Settings*.
. Search for `context`, then edit the settings.
+
[horizontal]
`context:defaultSize`:: The number of documents to display by default.
`context:step`:: The default number of documents to load with each button click. The default is 5.
`context:tieBreakerFields`:: The field to use for tiebreaking in case of equal time field values.
The default is the `_doc` field.
+
You can enter a comma-separated list of field
names, which is checked in sequence for suitability when a context is
displayed. The first suitable field is used as the tiebreaking
field. A field is suitable if the field exists and is sortable in the index
pattern the context is based on.
+
Although not required, it is recommended to only
use fields that have {ref}/doc-values.html[doc values] enabled to achieve
good performance and avoid unnecessary {ref}/modules-fielddata.html[field
data] usage. Common examples for suitable fields include log line numbers,
monotonically increasing counters and high-precision timestamps.
