[[set-time-filter]]
== Set the time filter
If your index contains time-based events, and a time-field is configured for the
selected <<index-patterns, index pattern>>, set a time filter that displays only the data within the
specified time range.

You can use the time filter to change the time range, or select a specific time
range in the histogram.
