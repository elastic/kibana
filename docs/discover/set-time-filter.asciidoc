== Setting the time filter
The time filter restricts the search results to a specific time period. You can
set a time filter if your index contains time-based events and a time-field is
configured for the selected index pattern.

By default the time filter is set to the last 15 minutes. You can use the time
picker to change the time filter, or select a specific time interval or time
range in the histogram at the top of the page.

=== Filtering with the time picker

You can specify a time filter in one of four ways:

* *Quick*. Click your desired time window from the options listed.
* *Relative*. Specify a time filter relative to the current time. You can 
specify the end time relative to the current time. Relative times can be in the past or future.
* *Absolute*. Specify both the start and end times for the time filter. You can 
adjust the time by editing the *To* and *From* fields.
* *Recent*. Click one of the times from your list of recently used time filters.

=== Filtering from the histogram

You can set a time filter from the histogram in one of two ways:

* Click the bar that represents the time interval you want to zoom in on.
* Click and drag to view a specific timespan. You must start the selection with
the cursor over the background of the chart--the cursor changes to a plus sign
when you hover over a valid start point.
