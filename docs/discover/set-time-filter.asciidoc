== Setting the Time Filter
The time filter restricts the search results to a specific time period. You can
set a time filter if your index contains time-based events and a time-field is
configured for the selected index pattern.

By default the time filter is set to the last 15 minutes. You can use the Time
Picker to change the time filter or select a specific time interval or time
range in the histogram at the top of the page.

To set a time filter with the Time Picker:

. Click Time Picker image:images/time-picker.jpg[] in the Kibana toolbar.
. To set a quick filter, click one of the shortcut links.

. To specify a time filter relative to the current time, click *Relative* and
specify the start time as a number of seconds, minutes, hours, days,
months, or years. You can also specify the end time relative
to the current time. Relative times can be in the past or future.

. To specify both the start and end times for the time filter, click
*Absolute* and select a start and end date. You can adjust the time
by editing the *To* and *From* fields.

. Click the caret in the bottom right corner to close the Time Picker.

To set a time filter from the histogram, do one of the following:

* Click the bar that represents the time interval you want to zoom in on.
* Click and drag to view a specific timespan. You must start the selection with
the cursor over the background of the chart--the cursor changes to a plus sign
when you hover over a valid start point.

To move forward/backward in time, click the arrows to the left or right of the Time Picker:

You can use the browser Back button to undo your changes.

The displayed time range and interval are shown on the histogram. By default,
the interval is set automatically based on the time range. To use a different
interval, click the link and select an interval.
