**View single document** to open it in a separate view.

There are two tabular views of the selected document available. **Table** displays the document's fields row by row.
**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) allows you to take a look at how the document is returned from Elasticsearch.

The main purpose of this view is sharing or bookmarking a link to the selected document.
The link is valid for the time the document is available in Elasticsearch.

This view is extendable, so you can add custom views of a document by creating 
<<external-plugin-development, your own plugins>>.
