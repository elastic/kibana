== View single document

Once you've found a document of interest in Discover there's a simple way to share or bookmark it. 

. In the document table, click the expand icon (>).
. Click **View single document**

This allows you to view the document in two ways. **Table** displays the document's fields row by row.
**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) allows you to take a look at how the document is returned from Elasticsearch.

The link is valid for the time the document is available in Elasticsearch. If you need another way to view single 
documents, you can extend **Table** and **JSON** by creating <<external-plugin-development, your own plugin>>.
