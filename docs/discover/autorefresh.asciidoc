=== Refreshing the Search Results
As more documents are added to the indices you're searching, the search results
shown in Discover and used to display visualizations get stale. You can
configure a refresh interval to periodically resubmit your searches to
retrieve the latest results.

To enable auto refresh:

. Click the time filter.
. In the *Refresh every* field, enter the refresh rate, then select the interval from the dropdown.
. Click *Start*.

To automatically refresh the data, click the image:images/autorefresh.png[] *Auto-refresh* button when the time picker
is open and select an autorefresh interval:

To disable auto refresh, click *Stop*.

NOTE: If auto refresh is not enabled, you can manually refresh visualizations
by clicking *Refresh*.
