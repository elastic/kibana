== Using {esql}

The Elasticsearch Query Language, {esql}, makes it easier to explore your data without leaving Discover. 

In this tutorial we'll use the {kib} sample web logs in Discover and Lens to explore the data and create visualizations.

=== Prerequisite 

To be able to select **Language {esql}** from the Data views menu the `enableESQL` setting must be enabled from **Stack Management > Advanced Settings**. It is enabled by default.

=== Use {esql}

To load the sample data:

. On the home page, click **Try sample data**.
. Click **Other sample data sets**.
. On the Sample web logs card, click **Add data**.
. Open the main menu and select *Discover*.
. From the Data views menu, select *Language {esql}*.

Let's say we want to find out what operating system users have and how much RAM is on their machine.  

. Set the time range to **Last 7 days**.
. Expand image:images/expand-icon-2.png[An image of the expand icon] the query bar.
. Put each processing command on a new line for better readability.
. Copy the query below:
+
[source,esql]
----
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs 
| KEEP machine.os, machine.ram
----
+
. Click **▶Run**.

[NOTE]
====
{esql} keywords are not case sensitive.

Let's add `geo.dest` to our query, to find out the geographical destination of the visits, and limit the results. 

. Copy the query below:
+
[source,esql]
----
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs 
| KEEP machine.os, machine.ram, geo.dest
| LIMIT 10
----
+
. Click **▶Run**.

Let's sort the data by machine ram and filter out the destination GB. 

. Copy the query below:
+
[source,esql]
----
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs 
| KEEP machine.os, machine.ram, geo.dest
| SORT machine.ram desc
| WHERE geo.dest != "GB"
| LIMIT 10
----
+
. Click **▶Run**.

. Click **Save** to save the query and visualization to a dashboard. 

To make changes to the visualization you can use the visualization drop-down. To make changes to the colors used or the axes, or click the pencil icon. This opens an in-line editor where you can change the colors and axes of the visualization.
