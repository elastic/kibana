[[field-filter]]
== Filtering by field

*Discover* offers
various types of filters, so you can restrict your documents to the exact data you want.
For example, you might look at the results for a
particular period of time. Or, you might include&mdash;or exclude&mdash;
all HTTP redirects that come from a specific IP and port.

=== Add a filter

A quick way to add a filter is from the fields list.

. Click the field to filter on.
+
You'll see the number of documents that contain
the field, the top 5 values for the field, and the percentage of documents
that contain each value.
+

. Use the image:images/PositiveFilter.jpg[Positive Filter] icon to
show only documents that contain that value,
or image:images/NegativeFilter.jpg[Negative Filter] to exclude all documents with that value.
+
If there is no data to display, you might need to set a <<set-time-filter, date time filter>>.
You can choose a time from the quick filter or choose your
own using absolute or relative times.

. Try also these filtering options:
+
*  To limit the field
list to a particular data type, click *Filter by type*.
You can also filter for whether that type is
aggregatable or searchable.
+
* To filter for whether a field is present, expand the document in
the document table, hover over the field, and click the *Filter for field present* icon.

=== Filter by condition

You can filter using advanced criteria,
such as if a value is equal to or in between certain values.

. Click *Add Filter*.

. Select a field.

. Select an operation for your filter:
+
[horizontal]
`is`:: The value for the field matches the given value.
`is not`:: The value for the field does not match the given value.
`is one of`:: The field matches one of the specified values.
`is not one of`:: The value for the field does not match any of the specified values.
`is between`:: The value for the field is in the given range.
`is not between`:: The value for the field is not in the given range.
`exists`:: Any value is present for the field.
`does not exist`:: No value is present for the field.
. Choose values for your filter.
+
Values from your indices may be suggested
as selections if you are filtering against an aggregatable field.

. (Optional) Specify a label for the filter.

. Click *Save* to apply the filter to your search.
+
NOTE: If you are experiencing long-running queries as a result of the value suggestions, you can
turn off the suggestions by setting `filterEditor:suggestValues` to `false`
in <<advanced-options,
Advanced Settings>>.

[[filter-pinning]]
=== Edit, disable, and delete filters

To modify a filter, click its tag, and then select one of the following actions.

*Pin across all apps*::
Persist the filter
when you switch contexts in Kibana. For example, you can pin a filter
in *Discover* and it remains in place when you switch to *Visualize*.
A filter is based on a particular index field&mdash;if the indices being
searched do not contain the field in a pinned filter, it has no effect.

*Edit filter*::
Edit the
filter definition and label.

*Exclude results*::
Switch from a positive
filter to a negative filter, and vice versa.

*Temporarily disable*::
Disable the filter without
removing it. Click again to reenable the filter.

*Delete*::
Delete the filter.

To apply an action to all filters,
click the *Actions* icon, and then select the action.



[float]
[[filter-edit]]
=== Modify the filter query

You can directly modify
the query that filters your search results.  This enables you
to create more complex filters using multiple fields.

. Click the filter tag, and then select *Edit > Edit Query DSL*.

. Edit the query for the filter.

For example, if you are using the sample log data, you can use the
{ref}/query-dsl-bool-query.html[bool query] to create a filter
that displays the hits that originated from Canada or China that resulted in a 404 error:
+
==========
[source,json]
{
  "bool": {
    "should": [
      {
        "term": {
          "geoip.country_name.raw": "Canada"
        }
      },
      {
        "term": {
          "geoip.country_name.raw": "China"
        }
      }
    ],
    "must": [
      {
        "term": {
          "response": "404"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
==========
