== Filtering by Field
You can filter the search results to display only those documents that contain a particular value in a field. You can
also create negative filters that exclude documents that contain the specified field value.

You can add filters from the Fields list or from the Documents table. When you add a filter, it is displayed in the
filter bar below the search query. From the filter bar, you can enable or disable a filter, invert the filter (change
it from a positive filter to a negative filter and vice-versa), toggle the filter on or off, or remove it entirely.
Click the small left-facing arrow to the right of the index pattern selection drop-down to collapse the Fields list.

To add a filter from the Fields list:

. Click the name of the field you want to filter on. This displays the top five values for that field. To the right of
each value, there are two magnifying glass buttons--one for adding a regular (positive) filter, and
one for adding a negative filter.
. To add a positive filter, click the *Positive Filter* button image:images/PositiveFilter.jpg[Positive Filter Button].
This filters out documents that don't contain that value in the field.
. To add a negative filter, click the *Negative Filter* button image:images/NegativeFilter.jpg[Negative Filter Button].
This excludes documents that contain that value in the field.

To add a filter from the Documents table:

. Expand a document in the Documents table by clicking the *Expand* button image:images/ExpandButton.jpg[Expand Button]
to the left of the document's entry in the first column (the first column is usually Time). To the right of each field
name, there are two magnifying glass buttons--one for adding a regular (positive) filter, and one for adding a negative
filter.
. To add a positive filter  based on the document's value in a field, click the
*Positive Filter* button image:images/PositiveFilter.jpg[Positive Filter Button]. This filters out documents that don't
contain the specified value in that field.
. To add a negative filter based on the document's value in a field, click the
*Negative Filter* button image:images/NegativeFilter.jpg[Negative Filter Button]. This excludes documents that contain
the specified value in that field.
