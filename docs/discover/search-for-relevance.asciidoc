=== Search for relevance

Sometimes you might be unsure which documents best match your search.
{es} assigns a relevancy, or score to each document, so you can
can narrow you search to the documents with the most relevant results.
The higher the score, the better it matches your query.

For example, suppose you have the <<gs-get-data-into-kibana, sample flights data set>>, and you're a searching for
a flight that arrived or departed from `Warsaw` or `Venice` when the weather was clear.

* In *Discover*, open the index pattern dropdown, and select `kibana_sample_data_flight`.
* In the query bar, click  *KQL*, and switch to the <<lucene-query, Lucene query syntax>>.
. Search for `Warsaw OR Venice OR Clear`.
.  If you don't see any results, open the time filter and select a time range that contains data.
.  From the list of *Available fields*, add `_score` to the document table.
. Click the header for the `_score` column and sort it  by descending scores.
+
The results are currently sorted by first `Time`, and then by `_score`.
. To sort only by `_score`, remove the `Time` field.
+
Your table now shows documents with the best matches, from most to least relevant.
