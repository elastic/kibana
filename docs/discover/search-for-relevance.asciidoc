[[discover-search-for-relevance]]
== Search for relevance
{es} assigns a relevancy, or score to each document, so you can
can narrow your search to the documents with the most relevant results.
The higher the score, the better it matches your query.

This example shows how to use *Discover* to list
your documents from most relevant to least relevant. This example uses
the <<gs-get-data-into-kibana, sample flights data set>>, or you can use your own data.

.  In *Discover*, open the {data-source} dropdown, and select that data you want to work with.
+
For the sample flights data, set the {data-source} to *kibana_sample_data_flights*.

.  Run your search.  For the sample data, try:
+
```ts
Warsaw OR Venice OR Clear
```
. If you don't see any results, expand the <<set-time-filter,time range>>, for example to *Last 7 days*.
. From the list of *Available fields*, add `_score` and any other fields you want to the document table.
+
At this point, you're sorting by the`timestamp` field.
. To turn off sorting for the `timestamp` field, click the *field sorted* option, and then click *Clear sorting.*
. To turn on sorting by the `_score` field in descending order, open the dropdown menu and click *_score*, and then select *High-Low*.
