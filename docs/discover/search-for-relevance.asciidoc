=== Discover - Search for relevance

Sometimes you might be unsure, which documents match your question best. 
For this case, Elasticsearch can jump in to help.  Let's have a look at an example. You're a searching
a certain flight, you know it was starting or landing in `Warsaw`, but it could also be `Venice` and there 
were clear conditions. That's enough for an initial search.

1. Select `kibana_sample_data_flight` using the index pattern selector
2. Switch to <<lucene-query, Lucene query syntax>> 
3. Search for `Warsaw OR Venice OR Clear`
4. Choose a time range that contains data
5. Add `_score` to the document table and sort by `_score` 
6. Remove sorting by `Time`

This result should help you to narrow you search, Elasticsearch is returning a `_score`, the higher the `_score`
the better it matches your query.
