[[document-explorer-columns]]
=== Reorder and resize columns

Use drag and drop to organize the columns and improve the view of the data.

To reorder columns, do one of the following:

* Click *Columns*. In the pop-up, select the column you want to move and drag it to the new location.

* Click the header of the column you want to move. In the dropdown menu, click *Move left* or *Move right*.

To resize a column, drag the right edge of the column header until the column is the width that you want.

Column widths are stored with a saved search.  When you visualize saved searches on dashboards, the saved search appears the same as in **Discover**.
