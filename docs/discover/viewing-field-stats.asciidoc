== Viewing Field Data Statistics

From the Fields list, you can see how many of the documents in the Documents
table contain a particular field, what the top 5 values are, and what
percentage of documents contain each value.

Data can be visualized in various ways. The quick visualize can only be 
applied to aggregatable fields. The keyword fields can be visualized and 
they are available in the side bar if we uncheck "Hide missing fields".

To view field data statistics, click the name of a field in the Fields list.
