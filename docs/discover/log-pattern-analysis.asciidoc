Log pattern analysis works on every text field.

This example uses the <<gs-get-data-into-kibana, sample web logs data>>, or you
can use your own data.

. Open the main menu, and click *Discover*.

. Expand the {data-source} dropdown, and select *Kibana Sample Data Logs*.

. If you don't see any results, expand the time range, for example, to
*Last 15 days*.

. Click the `message` field in the **Available fields** list sidebar and click
**Run pattern analysis**.

The pattern analysis starts. The results are displayed in a flyout when the
analysis is complete.

. (optional) Apply filters to one or more patterns. *Discover* only displays
documents that match the selected patterns. Additionally, you can remove
selected patterns from *Discover*, resulting in the display of only those
documents that don't match the selected pattern. These options enable you to
remove unimportant messages and focus on the more important, actionable data
during troubleshooting.
