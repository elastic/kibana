== Explore the fields in your data

beta::[]

Explore the fields in your data with the *Field statistics* view in *Discover* and
answer such questions as:

* What does the latency
look like when one of the containers is down on a Sunday?
* Is the field type and format in the data view appropriate
for the data and its cardinality?

This example explores the fields in
the <<gs-get-data-into-kibana, sample web logs data>>, or you can use your own data.

. Open the main menu, and click *Discover*.

. Expand the {data-source} dropdown, and select *kibana_sample_data_logs*.

. If you don’t see any results, expand the time range, for example, to *Last 7 days*.

. Click *Field statistics*.
+
The table summarizes how many documents in the sample contain each field for the selected time period
the number of distinct values, and the distribution.

. Expand the `hour_of_day` field.
+
For numeric fields, *Discover* provides the
document statistics, minimum, median, and
maximum values, a list of top values, and a distribution chart.
Use this chart to get a better idea of how the values
in the data are clustered.
