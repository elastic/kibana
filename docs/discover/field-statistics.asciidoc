== Explore the fields in your data

beta::[]

Explore the fields in your data with the *Field statistics*.
You can answer questions such as:

* What does the latency
look like when one of the containers is down on a Sunday?
* What is the weather like when there are flight delays?
* How many fields in my index are empty or redundant?
* Is the field type and format specified in the data view appropriate
for the data and its cardinality?

This example explores the fields in
the <<gs-get-data-into-kibana, sample web logs data set>>, or you can use your own data.

. Go to *Stack Managment > Advanced Settings*, search for *Show field statistics*,
and turn on the setting.

. Go to *Discover*, open the {data-source} dropdown,
and select *kibana_sample_data_logs*.

. If you donâ€™t see any results, expand the time range, for example, to *Last 7 days*.

. Click *Field statistics*.
+
The table summarizes how many documents in the sample
for the selected time period contain each field,
the number of distinct values, and the distribution.

. Expand the `hour_of_day` field.
+
For numeric fields, *Discover* provides the
document statistics, minimum, median, and
maximum values, a list of top values, and a distribution chart.
Use the distribution chart to get a better idea of how the values
in the data are clustered.
