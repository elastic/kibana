=== Run a search session in the background

Sometimes you might need to search through large amounts of data no matter
how long the search takes. While this might not happen often,
there are times that long-running queries are required.
Consider a threat hunting scenario, where you need to search through years of data.

If your query is running long, you can save your search session, which
allows {kib} to continue processing your request in the
background.  Save your search session from *Discover* or *Dashboard*,
and when your session is complete, view and manage it in *Stack Management*.

Search sessions are <<search-session-settings-kb,enabled by default>>. Saving
a search session is only available when
<<set-time-filter,auto refresh>> is off.

==== Requirements


* To save a session, you must have permissions for *Discover* and *Dashboard*,

==== Example: Save a search session

You’re trying to understand a trend you see on a dashboard. You
need to look at several years of data, currently in
{ref}/data-tiers.html#cold-tier[cold storage],
but you don’t have time to wait. You want {kib} to
continue working in the background, so tomorrow you can
open your browser and pick up where you left off.

. Load your dashboard.
+
Your search session begins automatically. The icon after the dashboard title
displays the current state of the search session. A clock indicates the search session is in progress.
A checkmark indicates that the search session is complete.

. To instruct {kib} to continue a search in the background, click the clock icon,
and then click *Save session*. Once you save a search session, you can start a new search,
navigate to a different application, or close the browser.

. To view your saved searches, open the main menu, and then click
*Stack Management > Search Sessions*.  You can also open this view from the search sessions popup for a saved or completed session.

. Use the edit menu in *Search Sessions* to:
* *Inspect* the queries and filters that makeup the session.
* *Extend* the expiration of a completed session.
* *Delete* a session.

. To restore a search session, click its name in the *Search Sessions* view.
+
You're returned to the place from where you started the search session. The data is the same, but
behaves differently:
+
* Relative dates are converted to absolute dates.
* Panning and zooming is disabled for maps.
* Changing a filter, query, or drilldown starts a new search session, which can be slow.
