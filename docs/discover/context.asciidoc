[[discover-document-context]]
== View surrounding documents

Once you've narrowed your search to a specific event,
you might want to inspect the documents that occurred
immediately before and after the event. 
To view the surrounding documents, your index pattern must contain time-based events.

. In the document table, click the expand icon (>).
. Click *View surrounding documents.*
+
This opens the Context view of *Discover*.
The documents are sorted by the time field specified in the index pattern 
and displayed using the same set of columns as the *Discover* view from which 
the context was opened. The anchor document is highlighted in blue.

[[filter-context]]
=== Filter the context

The filters you applied in *Discover* are carried over to the Context view. 
Pinned filters remain active, while normal filters are copied in a disabled state. 
You can re-enable these filters to refine your context view.

If the Context view contains a large number of documents not related to the event under
investigation, you can use filters to restrict the documents to display.

[[change-context-size]]
=== Change the number of surrounding documents

By default, the five newest and oldest
documents are listed. To increase the number of documents that surround the anchor document,
click *Load*.

By default, five documents are added with each click. You can change the number of documents that
should be added by changing the number in the input displayed next to the *Load* button.

[[configure-context-ContextView]]
=== Configure the context view

To configure the Context view, go to <<advanced-options,
Advanced Settings>> and search for Context.

[horizontal]
`context:defaultSize`:: The number of documents to display by default.
`context:step`:: The default number of documents to load with each button click. The default is 5.
`context:tieBreakerFields`:: The field to use for tiebreaking in case of equal time field values.
The default is the `_doc` field.
+
You can enter a comma-separated list of field
names, which is checked in sequence for suitability when a context is
displayed. The first suitable field is used as the tiebreaking
field. A field is suitable if the field exists and is sortable in the index
pattern the context is based on.
+
Although not required, it is recommended to only
use fields that have {ref}/doc-values.html[doc values] enabled to achieve
good performance and avoid unnecessary {ref}/modules-fielddata.html[field
data] usage. Common examples for suitable fields include log line numbers,
monotonically increasing counters and high-precision timestamps.
