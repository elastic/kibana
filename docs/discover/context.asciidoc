== Viewing Document Context

For certain applications it can be useful to inspect a window of documents 
surrounding a specific event. The context view enables you to do just that for
index patterns that are configured to contain time-based events.

To show the context surrounding an anchor document, click the *Expand* button 
image:images/ExpandButton.jpg[Expand Button] to the left of the document's 
table entry and then click the *View surrounding documents* link.

The context view displays a number of documents before and after the anchor 
document. The anchor document itself is highlighted in blue. The view is sorted 
by the time field specified in the index pattern configuration and uses the 
same set of columns as the Discover view the context was opened from.

NOTE: The number of documents displayed by default can be configured 
via the `context:defaultSize` setting in <<advanced-options, *Management > 
Advanced Options*>>.

=== Changing the Context Size

You can change the number documents displayed before and after the anchor 
document independently.

To increase the number of displayed documents that are newer than the anchor
document, click the *Load 5 more* button above the document list or enter the 
desired number into the input box right of the button.
