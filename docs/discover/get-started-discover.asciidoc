== Get started with Discover

Learn how to use *Discover* to:

- **Select** and **filter** your {es} data.
- **Explore** the fields and content of that data in depth.
- **Present** your findings in a visualization.

*Prerequisites:*

- If you donâ€™t already have {kib}, https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup?baymax=docs-body&elektra=docs[start a free trial] on Elastic Cloud.
- You must have data in {es}. Examples on this page use the
<<gs-get-data-into-kibana,ecommerce sample data set>>, but you can use your own data.
- You should have an understanding of {ref}/documents-indices.html[{es} documents and indices]
and <<kibana-concepts-analysts, {kib} concepts>>.

[[find-the-data-you-want-to-use]]
=== Load data into Discover

Select the data you want to explore, and then specify the time range in which to view that data.

. Find **Discover** in the navigation menu or by using the <<kibana-navigation-search,global search field>>.

. Select the data view that contains the data you want to explore.
+
TIP: {kib} requires a <<data-views,{data-source}>> to access your Elasticsearch data. A {data-source} can point to one or more indices, {ref}/data-streams.html[data streams], or {ref}/alias.html[index aliases]. When adding data to {es} using one of the many integrations available, some data views are created automatically most of the time, but you can also create your own.
+
If you're using sample data, data views are automatically created and are ready to use.
+

image::images/discover-data-view.png[How to set the {data-source} in Discover, width="40%"]

. If needed, adjust the <<set-time-filter,time range>>, for example by setting it to the *Last 7 days*.
+
The range selection is based on the default time field in your data.
If you are using the sample data, this value was set when you added the data.
If you are using your own data, and it does not have a time field, the range selection is not available.

**Discover** is populated with your data and you can view various areas with different information:

* All fields detected are listed in a dedicated panel.
* A chart allows you to visualize your data. 
* A table that shows all the data matching your data view.
By default, the table includes a column for the time field and a column that lists all other fields in the document.
You can modify the document table to display your fields of interest.

You can later filter the data that shows in the chart and in the table by specifying a query and changing the time range.

[float]
[[explore-fields-in-your-data]]
=== Explore the fields in your data

**Discover** provides utilities designed to help you make sense of your data:

. In the sidebar, check the available fields. It's very common to have hundreds of fields. Use the search at the top of that sidebar to look for specific terms in the field names.
+
In this example, we've entered `ma` in the search field to find the `manufacturer` field.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/discover-sidebar-available-fields.png[Fields list that displays the top five search results, width=40%]
+
TIP: You can use wildcards in field searches.  For example, `goe*dest` finds `geo.dest` and `geo.src.dest`.

. Select a field to view its most frequent values.
+
**Discover** shows the top 10 values and the number of records used to calculate those values.

. Select the *Plus* icon to add fields to the results table.
You can also drag them from the list into the table.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/discover-add-icon.png[How to add a field as a column in the table, width="50%"]
+
When you add fields to the table, the **Summary** column that was summarizing each result's data is replaced.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/document-table.png[Document table with fields for manufacturer, customer_first_name, and customer_last_name]

. Arrange the view to your liking to display the fields and data you care most about using the various display options of **Discover**. For example, you can change the order and size of columns, expand the table to be in full screen or collapse the chart and the list of fields.

. **Save** your changes to be able to open the same view later on and explore your data further.


[float]
[[add-field-in-discover]]
==== Add a field to your {data-source}

What happens if you forgot to define an important value as a separate field? Or, what if you
want to combine two fields and treat them as one? This is where {ref}/runtime.html[runtime fields] come into play.
You can add a runtime field to your {data-source} from inside of **Discover**,
and then use that field for analysis and visualizations,
the same way you do with other fields.

. In the sidebar, select *Add a field*.

. In the *Create field* form, enter `hello` for the name.

. Turn on *Set value*.

. Define the script using the Painless scripting language.  Runtime fields require an `emit()`.
+
```ts
emit("Hello World!");
```

. Click *Save*.

. In the sidebar, search for the *hello* field, and then add it to the document table.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/hello-field.png[hello field in the document tables]

. Create a second field named `customer` that combines customer last name and first initial.
+
```ts
String str = doc['customer_first_name.keyword'].value;
char ch1 = str.charAt(0);
emit(doc['customer_last_name.keyword'].value + ", " + ch1);
```
. Remove `customer_first_name` and `customer_last_name` from the document table, and then add `customer`.
+

+
For more information on adding fields and Painless scripting language examples,
refer to <<runtime-fields, Explore your data with runtime fields>>.


[float]
[[search-in-discover]]
=== Search your data

One of the unique capabilities of **Discover** is the ability to combine
free text search with filtering based on structured data.
To search all fields, enter a simple string in the query bar.

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/discover-search-field.png[Search field in Discover]


To search particular fields and
build more complex queries, use the <<kuery-query,Kibana Query language>>.
As you type, KQL prompts you with the fields you can search and the operators
you can use to build a structured query.

Search the ecommerce data for documents where the country matches US:

. Enter `g`, and then select *geoip.country_iso_code*.
. Select *:* for equals some value and *US*, and then click the refresh button or press the Enter key.
. For a more complex search, try:
+
```ts
geoip.country_iso_code : US and products.taxless_price >= 75
```

[float]
[[filter-in-discover]]
=== Filter your data

Whereas the query defines the set of documents you are interested in,
filters enable you to zero in on subsets of those documents.
You can filter results to include or exclude specific fields, filter for a value in a range,
and more.

Exclude documents where day of week is not Wednesday:

. Click image:images/add-icon.png[Add icon] next to the query bar.
. In the *Add filter* pop-up, set the field to *day_of_week*, the operator to *is not*,
and the value to *Wednesday*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/discover-add-filter.png[Add filter dialog in Discover]

. Click **Add filter**.
. Continue your exploration by adding more filters.
. To remove a filter,
click the close icon (x) next to its name in the filter bar.

[float]
[[look-inside-a-document]]
=== Look inside a document

Dive into an individual document to view its fields and the documents
that occurred before and after it.

. In the document table, click the expand icon
image:images/expand-icon-2.png[double arrow icon to open a flyout with the document details]
to show document details.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/document-table-expanded.png[Table view with document expanded]

. Scan through the fields and their values. If you find a field of interest,
hover your mouse over the *Actions* column for filters and other options.

. To create a view of the document that you can bookmark and share, click **Single document**.

. To view documents that occurred before or after the event you are looking at, click
**Surrounding documents**.



[float]
[[save-your-search]]
=== Save your search for later use

Save your search so you can use it later, generate a CSV report, or use it to create visualizations, dashboards, and Canvas workpads.
Saving a search saves the query text, filters,
and current view of *Discover*, including the columns selected in
the document table, the sort order, and the {data-source}.

. In the toolbar, click **Save**.

. Give your search a title.

. Optionally store <<managing-tags,tags>> and the time range with the search.

. Click **Save**.

[float]
=== Visualize your findings
If a field can be {ref}/search-aggregations.html[aggregated], you can quickly
visualize it from **Discover**.

. In the sidebar, find and then click `day_of_week`.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/discover-day-of-week.png[Top values for the day_of_week field, plus Visualize button, width=50%]


. In the popup, click **Visualize**.
+
{kib} creates a visualization best suited for this field.

. From the *Available fields* list, drag and drop `manufacturer.keyword` onto the workspace.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/discover-from-visualize.png[Visualization that opens from Discover based on your data]

. Save your visualization for use on a dashboard.
+
For geo point fields (image:images/geoip-icon.png[Geo point field icon, width=20px]),
if you click **Visualize**,
your data appears in a map.
+

[float]
[[share-your-findings]]
=== Share your findings

To share your findings with a larger audience, click *Share* in the *Discover* toolbar.
For detailed information about the sharing options, refer to <<reporting-getting-started,Reporting>>.

[float]
[[alert-from-Discover]]
=== Generate alerts

From *Discover*, you can create a rule to periodically
check when data goes above or below a certain threshold within a given time interval.

. Ensure that your data view,
query, and filters fetch the data for which you want an alert.
. In the toolbar, click *Alerts > Create search threshold rule*.
+
The *Create rule* form is pre-filled with the latest query sent to {es}.
. <<rule-type-es-query, Configure your query>> and <<action-types, select a connector type>>.

. Click *Save*.

For more about this and other rules provided in {alert-features}, go to <<alerting-getting-started>>.
