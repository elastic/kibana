=== Working with Filters

When you create a filter anywhere in Kibana, the filter conditions display in an oval under the search text
entry box:

Hovering on the filter oval displays the following icons:

image::images/filter-allbuttons.png[]

Enable Filter image:images/filter-enable.png[]:: Click this icon to disable the filter without removing it. You can
enable the filter again later by clicking the icon again. Disabled filters display a striped shaded color, grey for
inclusion filters and red for exclusion filters.
Pin Filter image:images/filter-pin.png[]:: Click this icon to _pin_ a filter. Pinned filters persist across Kibana tabs.
You can pin filters from the _Visualize_ tab, click on the _Discover_ or _Dashboard_ tabs, and those filters remain in
place.
NOTE: If you have a pinned filter and you're not seeing any query results, that your current tab's index pattern is one
that the filter applies to.
Toggle Filter image:images/filter-toggle.png[]:: Click this icon to _toggle_ a filter. By default, filters are inclusion
filters, and display in grey. Only elements that match the filter are displayed. To change this to an exclusion
filters, displaying only elements that _don't_ match, toggle the filter. Exclusion filters display in red.
Remove Filter image:images/filter-delete.png[]:: Click this icon to remove a filter entirely.
Custom Filter image:images/filter-custom.png[]:: Click this icon to display a text field where you can customize the JSON
representation of the filter and specify an alias to use for the filter name:

You can use JSON filter representation to implement predicate logic, with `should` for OR, `must` for AND, and `must_not`
for NOT:
