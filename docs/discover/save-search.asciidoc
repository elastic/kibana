== Save a search
A saved search persists your current view of Discover for
later retrieval and reuse. You can reload a saved search into Discover,
add it to a dashboard, and use it as the basis for a visualization.

A saved search includes the query text, filters, and optionally, the time filter. A saved search also includes the selected columns in the document table, the sort order, and the current index pattern.
