== Save a search

A saved search is a convenient way to reuse a search
that you've created in *Discover*.
Saved searches are good for adding search results to a dashboard, 
and can also serve as the basis for building visualizations.

Saved searches include information about the query and the current *Discover*
view&mdash;the columns selected in the document table, the sort order,
and the index pattern.

A saved search is different than a <<save-load-delete-query,saved query>>, which stores
the query text, filters, and time range. Saved queries
are available in any app that has a query bar.

used for the saved search is also automatically selected.
