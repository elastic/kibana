== Save a search for reuse

A saved Discover Session is a convenient way to reuse a search
that you've created in *Discover*.
Saved Discover Sessions are good for returning to them later or adding search results to a dashboard,
and can also serve as a foundation for building visualizations.

=== Save a Discover Session

By default, a saved Discover Session stores the query text, filters, and
current view of *Discover*, including the columns and sort order in the document table, and the {data-source}.

. Once you've created a search worth saving, click *Save* in the toolbar.
. Enter a name for the session.
. Optionally store <<managing-tags,tags>> and the time range with the session.
. Click *Save*.
. To reload your search results in *Discover*, click *Open* in the toolbar, and select the saved search.

If the saved Discover Session is associated with a different {data-source} than is currently
selected, opening the saved Discover Session changes the selected {data-source}. The query language
used for the saved Discover Session is also automatically selected.
