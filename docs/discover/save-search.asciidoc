== Save a search for reuse

A saved search is a convenient way to reuse a search
that you've created in *Discover*.
Saved searches are good for adding search results to a dashboard,
and can also serve as a foundation for building visualizations.

A saved search stores the query text, filters, and
current view of *Discover*, including the columns selected in the document table,
the sort order, and the {data-source}.
Saved searches are different from <<save-load-delete-query,saved queries>>, which
are for storing query text and are available in any app with a query bar.
