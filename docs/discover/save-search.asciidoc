== Save a search for reuse

A saved search is a convenient way to reuse a search
that you've created in *Discover*.
Saved searches are good for adding search results to a dashboard.

A saved search stores the query text, filters, and
current view of *Discover*&mdash;the columns selected in the document table,
the sort order, and the index pattern.

Saved searches are different from <<save-load-delete-query,saved queries>>, which store
only the query and are available in any app that has a query bar. Saved searches
can serve as a foundation for building visualizations.
