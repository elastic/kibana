== Kibana Apps

The Kibana UI serves as a framework that can contain several different applications. You can switch between these
applications by clicking the image:images/app-button.png[App Picker] *App picker* button to display the app bar:

Click an app icon to switch to that app's functionality.

Applications in the Kibana UI are managed by <<kibana-plugins,_plugins_>>. Plugins can expose app functionality or add new
visualization types.
