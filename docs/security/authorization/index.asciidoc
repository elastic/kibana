=== Authorization

Authorizing users to use {kib} in simple configurations is as easy as assigning the user
either the `kibana_user` or `kibana_dashboard_only_user` reserved role. If you're running 
a single tenant of {kib} against your {es} cluster, and you're not controlling access to individual spaces, then this is sufficient and no other action is required.

==== Spaces

If you want to control individual spaces in {kib}, do **not** use the `kibana_user` or `kibana_dashboard_only_user` roles. Users with these roles are able to access all spaces in Kibana. Instead, create your own roles that grant access to specific spaces.

==== Multi-tenant {kib}

When running multiple tenants of {kib}, and changing the `kibana.index` in your `kibana.yml`, you 
must create custom roles that authorize the user for that specific tenant. You can use
either the *Management / Security / Roles* page in {kib} or the <<role-management-api>>
to assign a specific <<kibana-privileges, Kibana privilege>> at that tenant. After creating the
custom role, you should assign this role to the user(s) that you wish to have access.

While multi-tenant installations are supported, the recommended approach to securing access to segments of {kib} is to grant users access to specific spaces.
