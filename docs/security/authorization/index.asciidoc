=== Authorization in Kibana

<titleabbrev>Authorization</titleabbrev>

Prior to {kib} 6.4, it was required to give {kib} users access to the underlying `.kibana`
index in Elasticsearch. This allowed {kib} to defer to the {es} authorization model, and 
create roles that had either read-only or read-and-write access to all Dashboards, Visualizations, 
Saved Searches, etc. that are stored in the `.kibana` index. This approach requires you to know
the details of where and how data is stored by {kib}.

This is no longer the case with <<kibana-privileges>>. Kibana privileges allow you to 
grant access to Kibana features without concerning yourself with the way the data is stored in 
Elasticsearch. To create a role with <<kibana-privileges>>, you can either use the 
*Management / Security / Roles* page in {kib} or you can use {kib}'s <<role-management-api>>.
