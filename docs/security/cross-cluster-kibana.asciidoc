==== Cross Cluster Search and Kibana

When Kibana is used to search across multiple clusters, a two-step authorization
process determines whether or not the user can access indices on a remote
cluster:

* First, the local cluster determines if the user is authorized to access remote
clusters. (The local cluster is the cluster Kibana is connected to.)
* If they are, the remote cluster then determines if the user has access
to the specified indices.

To grant Kibana users access to remote clusters, assign them a local role
with read privileges to indices on the remote clusters. You specify remote
cluster indices as `<remote_cluster_name>:<index_name>`.

To enable users to actually read the remote indices, you must create a matching
role on the remote clusters that grants the `read_cross_cluster` privilege
and access to the appropriate indices.

For example, if Kibana is connected to the cluster where you're actively
indexing Logstash data (your _local cluster_) and you're periodically
offloading older time-based indices to an archive cluster
(your _remote cluster_) and you want to enable Kibana users to search both
clusters:

. On the local cluster, create a `logstash_reader` role that grants
`read` and `view_index_metadata` privileges on the local `logstash-*` indices.
+
NOTE: If you configure the local cluster as another remote in {es}, the
`logstash_reader` role on your local cluster also needs to grant the
`read_cross_cluster` privilege.

. Assign your Kibana users the `kibana_user` role and your `logstash_reader`
role.

. On the remote cluster, create a `logstash_reader` role that grants the
`read_cross_cluster` privilege and `read` and `view_index_metadata` privileges
for the `logstash-*` indices.
