          - "A string of 32 or more characters used to encrypt sensitive properties on alerting rules and actions before they're stored in Elasticsearch. Third party credentials &mdash; such as the username and password used to connect to an SMTP service &mdash; are an example of encrypted properties."
          - "Kibana offers a <<kibana-encryption-keys, CLI tool>> to help generate this encryption key."
          - "If not set, Kibana will generate a random key on startup, but all alerting and action functions will be blocked. Generated keys are not allowed for alerting and actions because when a new key is generated on restart, existing encrypted data becomes inaccessible. For the same reason, alerting and actions in high-availability deployments of Kibana will behave unexpectedly if the key isn't the same on all instances of Kibana."
          - "Although the key can be specified in clear text in `kibana.yml`, it's recommended to store this key securely in the <<secure-settings,Kibana Keystore>>. Be sure to back up the encryption key value somewhere safe, as your alerting rules and actions will cease to function due to decryption failures should you lose it.  If you want to rotate the encryption key, be sure to follow the instructions on <<encryption-key-rotation, encryption key rotation>>."

          In the following example, two custom host settings
          are defined.  The first provides a custom host setting for mail server
          `mail.example.com` using port 465 that supplies server certificate authentication
          data from both a file and inline, and requires TLS for the
          connection.  The second provides a custom host setting for https server
          `webhook.example.com` which turns off server certificate authentication,
          that will allow Kibana to connect to the server if it's using a self-signed
          certificate.  The individual properties that can be used in the settings are
          documented below.
