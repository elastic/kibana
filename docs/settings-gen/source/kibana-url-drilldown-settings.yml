          For example, to allow only external URLs to the `example.com` domain with the `https` scheme, except for the `danger.example.com` sub-domain, which is denied even when `https` scheme is used:

          ```yaml
          externalUrl.policy:
            - allow: false
              host: danger.example.com
            - allow: true
              host: example.com
              protocol: https
          ```
