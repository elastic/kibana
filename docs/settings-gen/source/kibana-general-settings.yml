          Set this to `false` to add the [`unsafe-eval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src#unsafe_eval_expressions) source expression to the `script-src` directive.

          When `csp.disableUnsafeEval` is set to `true`, Kibana will use a custom version of the Handlebars template library. Handlebars is used in various locations in the Kibana frontend where custom templates can be supplied by the user when for instance setting up a visualisation. If you experience any issues rendering Handlebars templates, please set this setting to `false` and [open an issue](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/new/choose) in the Kibana GitHub repository.

        deprecation_details: "Deprecated in 8.7.0. Use `csp.script_src: ['unsafe-eval']` instead if you wish to enable `unsafe-eval`. This config option will have no effect in a future version."
