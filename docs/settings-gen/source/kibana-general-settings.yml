          Set this to `false` to add the [`unsafe-eval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src#unsafe_eval_expressions) source expression to the `script-src` directive.

          When `csp.disableUnsafeEval` is set to `true`, Kibana will use a custom version of the Handlebars template library. Handlebars is used in various locations in the Kibana frontend where custom templates can be supplied by the user when for instance setting up a visualisation. If you experience any issues rendering Handlebars templates, please set this setting to `false` and [open an issue](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/new/choose) in the Kibana GitHub repository.

        deprecation_details: "Deprecated in 8.7.0. Use `csp.script_src: ['unsafe-eval']` instead if you wish to enable `unsafe-eval`. This config option will have no effect in a future version."

          A list of logging appenders to forward the root level logger instance to.  By default `root` is configured with the `default` appender that logs to stdout with a `pattern` layout. This is the configuration that all custom loggers will use unless they’re re-configured explicitly. You can override the default behavior by configuring a different [appender](docs-content://deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/kibana-logging.md#logging-appenders) to apply to `root`.

          Level at which a log record should be logged. Supported levels are: *all*, *fatal*, *error*, *warn*, *info*, *debug*, *trace*, *off*. Levels are ordered from *all* (highest) to *off* and a log record will be logged it its level is higher than or equal to the level of its logger, otherwise the log record is ignored.

          The maximum count of saved objects that can be imported or exported.

It is recommended to only raise this setting if you are confident your server can hold this many objects in memory.

This setting exists to prevent the {{kib}} server from running out of memory when handling a large import payload. Note that this setting overrides the more general [`server.maxPayload`](#server-maxPayload) for saved object imports only.

Use the [`server.rewriteBasePath`](#server-rewriteBasePath) setting to tell {{kib}} if it should remove the basePath from requests it receives, and to prevent a deprecation warning at startup. This setting cannot end in a slash (`/`).
