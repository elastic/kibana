<p>The default settings in Graph API requests are configured to tune out noisy
results by using the following strategies:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Only looking at samples of the most-relevant documents for a query
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Only considering terms that have a significant statistical correlation with
the sample
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Only considering terms to be paired that have at least 3 documents asserting
that connection
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are useful defaults for getting the "big picture" signals from noisy data,
but they can miss details from individual documents. If you need to perform a
detailed forensic analysis, you can adjust the following settings to ensure a
graph exploration produces all of the relevant data:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Increase the <code class="literal">sample_size</code> to a larger number of documents to analyze more
data on each shard.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Set the <code class="literal">use_significance</code> setting to <code class="literal">false</code> to retrieve terms regardless
of any statistical correlation with the sample.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Set the <code class="literal">min_doc_count</code> for your vertices to 1 to ensure only one document is
required to assert a relationship.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="_what_can_i_do_to_improve_performance"></a>What can I do to improve performance?</h3><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/master/docs/user/graph/troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>With the default setting of <code class="literal">use_significance</code> set to <code class="literal">true</code>, the Graph API
performs a background frequency check of the terms it discovers as part of
exploration. Each unique term has to have its frequency looked up in the index,
which costs at least one disk seek. Disk seeks are expensive. If you don&#8217;t need
to perform this noise-filtering, setting <code class="literal">use_significance</code> to <code class="literal">false</code>
eliminates all of these expensive checks (at the expense of not performing any
quality-filtering on the terms).</p>
<p>If your data is noisy and you need to filter based on significance, you can
reduce the number of frequency checks by:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Reducing the <code class="literal">sample_size</code>. Considering fewer documents can actually be better
when the quality of matches is quite variable.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Avoiding noisy documents that have a large number of terms. You can do this by
either allowing ranking to naturally favor shorter documents in the top-results
sample (see <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/norms.html" class="ulink" target="_top">enabling norms</a>) or by explicitly excluding
large documents with your seed and guiding queries.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Increasing the frequency threshold. Many many terms occur very infrequently
so even increasing the frequency threshold by one can massively reduce the
number of candidate terms whose background frequencies are checked.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Keep in mind that all of these options reduce the scope of information analyzed
and can increase the potential to miss what could be interesting details. However,
the information that&#8217;s lost tends to be associated with lower-quality documents
with lower-frequency terms, which can be an acceptable trade-off.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="_limited_support_for_multiple_indices"></a>Limited support for multiple indices</h3><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/master/docs/user/graph/troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>The graph API can explore multiple indices, types, or aliases in a
single API request, but the assumption is that each "hop" it performs
is querying the same set of indices. Currently, it is not possible to
take a term found in a field from one index and use that value to explore
connections in <em>a different field</em> held in another type or index.</p>
<p>A good example of where this might be useful is if an IP address is
found in the <code class="literal">remote_host</code> field of an index called "weblogs20160101",
you might want to follow that up by looking for the same address in
the <code class="literal">ip_address</code> field of an index called "knownthreats".</p>
<p>Supporting this behavior would require extra mappings to indicate that
the weblogs' <code class="literal">remote_host</code> field contained values that had currency and
meaning in the <code class="literal">ip_address</code> field of the threats index.</p>
<p>Since we do not currently support this translation, you would have to
perform multiple calls to take the values from the weblogs index
response and build them into a separate request to the threats index.</p>
