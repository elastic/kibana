<p>We seriously appreciate thoughtful comments. If an issue is important to
you, add a comment with a solid write up of your use case and explain
why it’s so important. Please avoid posting comments comprised solely of
a thumbs up emoji 👍.</p>
<p>Granted that you share your thoughts, we might even be able to come up
with creative solutions to your specific problem. If everything you’d
like to say has already been brought up but you’d still like to add a
token of support, feel free to add a

summarizes your thoughts.</p>

<p>First of all, <span class="strong strong"><strong>sorry about that!</strong></span> We want you to have a great time with
Kibana.</p>
<p>There’s hundreds of open issues and prioritizing what to work on is an
important aspect of our daily jobs. We prioritize issues according to
impact and difficulty, so some issues can be neglected while we work on
more pressing issues.</p>
<p>Feel free to bump your issues if you think they’ve been neglected for a
prolonged period.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Now we’re talking</strong></span>. If you have a bug fix or new feature that you would
like to contribute to Kibana, please <span class="strong strong"><strong>find or open an issue about it
before you start working on it.</strong></span> Talk about what you would like to do.
It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are
particular issues that you should know about before implementing the
change.</p>
<p>We enjoy working with contributors to get their code accepted. There are
many approaches to fixing a problem and it is important to find the best
approach before writing too much code.</p>
