Here are some possible avenues of investigation:\n- Consider the user as identified by the username field. Is the user part of a group who normally logs into Windows hosts using RDP (remote desktop protocol)? Is this logon activity part of an expected workflow for the user?\n- Consider the source of the login. If the source is remote, could this be related to occasional troubleshooting or support activity by a vendor or an employee working remotely?","author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":["Uncommon username activity can be due to an engineer logging onto a server instance in order to perform manual troubleshooting or reconfiguration."],"from":"now-45m","interval":"15m","references":["https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/prebuilt-ml-jobs.html"],"tags":["Elastic","Host","Windows","Threat Detection","ML","Initial Access"],"threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","tactic":{"id":"TA0001","name":"Initial Access","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/"},"technique":[{"id":"T1078","name":"Valid Accounts","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/"}]}],"anomaly_threshold":50,"machine_learning_job_id":["v3_windows_rare_user_type10_remote_login"],"type":"machine_learning"},"id":"1781d055-5c66-4adf-9e93-fc0fa69550c9:100.0.2","type":"security-rule"}
