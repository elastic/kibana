This can be due to uncommon troubleshooting activity or due to a compromised account. A compromised account may be used by a threat actor to engage in system process discovery in order to increase their understanding of software applications running on a target host or network. This may be a precursor to selection of a persistence mechanism or a method of privilege elevation.","risk_score":21,"severity":"low","license":"Elastic License v2","author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":["Uncommon user command activity can be due to an engineer logging onto a server instance in order to perform manual troubleshooting or reconfiguration."],"from":"now-45m","interval":"15m","tags":["Elastic","Host","Linux","Threat Detection","ML"],"threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","tactic":{"id":"TA0007","name":"Discovery","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/"},"technique":[{"id":"T1057","name":"Process Discovery","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/"}]}],"anomaly_threshold":50,"machine_learning_job_id":["v3_linux_system_process_discovery"],"type":"machine_learning"},"id":"5c983105-4681-46c3-9890-0c66d05e776b:100.0.1","type":"security-rule"}
