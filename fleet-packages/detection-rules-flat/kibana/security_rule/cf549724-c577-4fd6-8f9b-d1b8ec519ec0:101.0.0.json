Consider changing this interval to a lower value, such as 10 minutes (10m).\n- See the following references for further information:\n  - https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566\n  - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html","timestamp_override":"event.ingested","author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":["Trusted domains may be added by system administrators.
