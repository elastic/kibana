A service account is a special type of account used by an application or a virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person. Applications use service accounts to make authorized API calls, authorized as either the service account itself, or as G Suite or Cloud Identity users through domain-wide delegation. If private keys are not tracked and managed properly, they can present a security risk. An adversary may create a new key for a service account in order to attempt to abuse the permissions assigned to that account and evade detection.","risk_score":21,"severity":"low","license":"Elastic License v2","note":"","timestamp_override":"event.ingested","author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":["Service account keys may be created by system administrators.
