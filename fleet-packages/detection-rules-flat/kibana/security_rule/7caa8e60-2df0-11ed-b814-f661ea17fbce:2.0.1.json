Consider changing this interval to a lower value, such as 10 minutes (10m).\n- See the following references for further information:\n  - https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566\n  - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html","timestamp_override":"event.ingested","author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":["Administrators may temporarily disabled Bitlocker on managed devices for maintenance, testing or to resolve potential endpoint conflicts."],"from":"now-130m","interval":"10m","references":["https://support.google.com/a/answer/9176657?hl=en"],"tags":["Elastic","Cloud","Google Workspace","Continuous Monitoring","SecOps","Configuration Audit","Defense Evasion"],"threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","tactic":{"id":"TA0005","name":"Defense Evasion","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/"},"technique":[{"id":"T1562","name":"Impair Defenses","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/","subtechnique":[{"id":"T1562.001","name":"Disable or Modify Tools","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/"}]}]}],"type":"query","index":["filebeat-*","logs-google_workspace*"],"language":"kuery","query":"event.dataset:\"google_workspace.admin\" and event.action:\"CHANGE_APPLICATION_SETTING\" and event.category:(iam or configuration)\n    and google_workspace.admin.new_value:\"Disabled\" and google_workspace.admin.setting.name:BitLocker*\n","related_integrations":[{"package":"google_workspace","version":"^1.2.0"}],"required_fields":[{"ecs":true,"name":"event.action","type":"keyword"},{"ecs":true,"name":"event.category","type":"keyword"},{"ecs":true,"name":"event.dataset","type":"keyword"},{"ecs":false,"name":"google_workspace.admin.new_value","type":"keyword"},{"ecs":false,"name":"google_workspace.admin.setting.name","type":"keyword"}],"setup":"The Google Workspace Fleet integration, Filebeat module, or similarly structured data is required to be compatible with this rule."},"id":"7caa8e60-2df0-11ed-b814-f661ea17fbce:2.0.1","type":"security-rule"}
