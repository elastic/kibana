This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from an uncommon domain. When malware is already running, it may send requests to an uncommon DNS domain the malware uses for command-and-control communication.","risk_score":21,"severity":"low","license":"Elastic License v2","author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":["A newly installed program or one that runs rarely as part of a monthly or quarterly workflow could trigger this alert.
