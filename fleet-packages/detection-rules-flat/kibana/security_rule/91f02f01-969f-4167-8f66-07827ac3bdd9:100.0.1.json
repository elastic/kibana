DNS tunneling can be used for command-and-control, persistence, or data exfiltration activity. For example, dnscat tends to generate many DNS questions for a top-level domain as it uses the DNS protocol to tunnel data.","risk_score":21,"severity":"low","license":"Elastic License v2","author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":["DNS domains that use large numbers of child domains, such as software or content distribution networks, can trigger this alert and such parent domains can be excluded."],"from":"now-45m","interval":"15m","references":["https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/prebuilt-ml-jobs.html"],"tags":["Elastic","Network","Threat Detection","ML","Command and Control"],"threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","tactic":{"id":"TA0011","name":"Command and Control","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/"},"technique":[{"id":"T1572","name":"Protocol Tunneling","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572/"}]}],"anomaly_threshold":50,"machine_learning_job_id":"packetbeat_dns_tunneling","type":"machine_learning"},"id":"91f02f01-969f-4167-8f66-07827ac3bdd9:100.0.1","type":"security-rule"}
