This could be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Data exfiltration activity may also produce such a surge in traffic to a destination country which does not normally appear in network traffic or business work-flows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms may communicate with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an unusual destination country for the source network.","risk_score":21,"severity":"low","license":"Elastic License v2","author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":["Business workflows that occur very occasionally, and involve an unusual surge in network traffic to one destination country, can trigger this alert.
