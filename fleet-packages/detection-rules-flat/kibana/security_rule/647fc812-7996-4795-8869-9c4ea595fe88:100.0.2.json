Here are some possible avenues of investigation:\n- Consider the user as identified by the username field. Is this program part of an expected workflow for the user who ran this program on this host?\n- Examine the history of execution. If this process only manifested recently, it might be part of a new software package. If it has a consistent cadence (for example if it runs monthly or quarterly), it might be part of a monthly or quarterly business process.\n- Examine the process arguments, title and working directory. These may provide indications as to the source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is performing.","author":["Elastic"],"false_positives":["A newly installed program or one that runs rarely as part of a monthly or quarterly workflow could trigger this alert."],"from":"now-45m","interval":"15m","references":["https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/prebuilt-ml-jobs.html"],"tags":["Elastic","Host","Linux","Threat Detection","ML","Persistence"],"threat":[{"framework":"MITRE ATT&CK","tactic":{"id":"TA0003","name":"Persistence","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/"},"technique":[{"id":"T1543","name":"Create or Modify System Process","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/","subtechnique":[{"id":"T1543.003","name":"Windows Service","reference":"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003/"}]}]}],"anomaly_threshold":50,"machine_learning_job_id":["v3_linux_anomalous_process_all_hosts"],"type":"machine_learning"},"id":"647fc812-7996-4795-8869-9c4ea595fe88:100.0.2","type":"security-rule"}
