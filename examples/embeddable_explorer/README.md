## Embeddable explorer

This example app shows how to:
 - Create a basic "hello world" embeddable
 - Create embeddables that accept inputs and use an EmbeddableRenderer
 - Nest embeddables inside a container
 - Dynamically add children to embeddable containers
 - Work with the EmbeddablePanel component

To run this example, use the command `yarn start --run-examples`.
