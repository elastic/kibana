# SharedUX Flyout System Examples

A Kibana example plugin to demonstrate the SharedUX Flyout System.

## Overview

This plugin provides two example implementations demonstrating different approaches to working with flyouts in Kibana:

1. **Widget 1**: Flyouts with `EuiFlyout` component (session-based and non-session-based)
2. **Widget 2**: Flyouts with `core.overlays.openSystemFlyout` (session-based) and `core.overlays.openFlyout` (non-session-based)
