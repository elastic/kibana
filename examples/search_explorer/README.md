## Search explorer

This example search explorer app shows how to use different search strategies in order to retrieve data.

One demo uses the built in elasticsearch search strategy, and runs a search against data in elasticsearch. The
other demo uses the custom demo search strategy, a custom search strategy registerd inside the [demo_search plugin](../demo_search).

To run this example, use the command `yarn start --run-examples`.
