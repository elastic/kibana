## Partial Results Example

The partial results is a feature of the expressions plugin allowing to emit intermediate execution results over time.

This example plugin demonstrates:

1. An expression function emitting a datatable with intermediate results (`getEvents`).
2. An expression function emitting an infinite number of results (`countEvent`).
3. A combination of those two functions using the `mapColumn` function that continuously updates the resulting table.
