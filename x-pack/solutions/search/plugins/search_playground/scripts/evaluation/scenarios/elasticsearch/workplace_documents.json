This policy applies to all employees and aims to foster a culture of continuous improvement, professional growth, and open communication between employees and management.\nPerformance Planning and Goal Setting\nAt the beginning of each performance cycle, employees and their supervisors will collaborate to set clear, achievable, and measurable performance goals. These goals should align with the company\u2019s strategic objectives and take into account the employee\u2019s job responsibilities, professional development, and career aspirations.\nOngoing Feedback and Communication\nThroughout the performance cycle, employees and supervisors are encouraged to engage in regular, constructive feedback and open communication. This includes discussing progress towards goals, addressing challenges, and identifying opportunities for improvement or additional support. Regular check-ins and updates help ensure that employees stay on track and receive the guidance they need to succeed.\nPerformance Evaluation\nAt the end of each performance cycle, employees will participate in a formal performance evaluation with their supervisor. This evaluation will assess the employee\u2019s overall performance, including their achievements, areas for improvement, and progress towards goals. Both the employee and supervisor should come prepared to discuss specific examples, accomplishments, and challenges from the performance period.\nPerformance Ratings\nBased on the performance evaluation, employees will receive a performance rating that reflects their overall performance during the cycle. The rating system should be clearly defined and consistently applied across the organization. Performance ratings will be used to inform decisions regarding promotions, salary increases, and other rewards or recognition.\nPromotions and Advancements\nHigh-performing employees who consistently demonstrate strong performance, leadership, and a commitment to the company\u2019s values may be considered for promotions or other advancement opportunities.

Employees interested in pursuing a promotion should discuss their career goals and development plans with their supervisor.\nPerformance Improvement Plans\nEmployees who receive a low performance rating or are struggling to meet their performance goals may be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). A PIP is a structured plan designed to help the employee address specific areas of concern, set achievable improvement goals, and receive additional support or resources as needed. Employees on a PIP will be closely monitored and re-evaluated at the end of the improvement period to determine if satisfactory progress has been made.\nRecognition and Rewards\nOur company believes in recognizing and rewarding employees for their hard work and dedication.
