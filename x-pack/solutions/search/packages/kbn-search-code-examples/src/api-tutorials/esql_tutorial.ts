# ‚úÖ The response includes a summary of successes and errors for each operation.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Step 3: Run a basic full-text search. üîé
# -----------------------------------------------
# Note: when ES|QL queries are run from within the Kibana Console, they must be wrapped in triple quotes syntax.

POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM kibana_sample_data_esql
    | WHERE description:"comfort food"
    | LIMIT 1000
  """
}

# ‚úÖ The response includes 'columns' and 'values' to represent the column headers and the rows included in the result set.
# By default, ES|QL uses OR logic between search terms, so it matches documents that contain any of the specified words.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Step 4: Show specific fields in results. üìã
# -----------------------------------------------
# You can specify the exact fields to include in your results using the KEEP command.

POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM kibana_sample_data_esql
    | WHERE description:"comfort food"
    | KEEP title, description, rating
    | LIMIT 1000
  """
}

# ‚úÖ The response includes only the title, description, and rating fields.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Step 5: Sort by relevance score. üìä
# -----------------------------------------------
# 'METADATA _score' tells ES|QL to include relevance scores in the results.
# Without explicit sorting, results aren't ordered by relevance even when scores are calculated.

# ‚úÖ The response includes documents sorted by relevance score.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Step 6: Exact match filtering. üéØ
# -----------------------------------------------
# This is fundamentally different from full-text search - it's a binary yes/no filter that doesn't affect relevance scoring.

POST /_query
{

}

# ‚úÖ The response includes documents with category exactly 'Breakfast'.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Step 7: Require all search terms (AND logic). üß†
# -----------------------------------------------
# The MATCH function with AND logic doesn't require terms to be adjacent or in order.

POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM kibana_sample_data_esql
    | WHERE match(description, "fluffy pancakes", {"operator": "AND"})
    | LIMIT 1000

# Step 8: Minimum number of terms to match üßÆ
# -----------------------------------------------

POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM kibana_sample_data_esql
    | WHERE match(title, "fluffy pancakes breakfast", {"minimum_should_match": 2})

# -----------------------------------------------
# Step 9: Search for exact phrases üî§
# -----------------------------------------------

    | WHERE MATCH_PHRASE(description, "rich and creamy")
    | KEEP title, description
    | LIMIT 1000

}

# ‚úÖ The response includes documents where 'rich and creamy' appears as a phrase.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Step 10: Date range filtering üìÖ
# -----------------------------------------------

POST /_query
{
  "query": """

    | SORT rating DESC
    | LIMIT 1000
  """

# ‚úÖ The response includes highly-rated recipes.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Step 12: Search across multiple fields üî¶
# -----------------------------------------------

POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM kibana_sample_data_esql
    | WHERE title:"vegetarian curry" OR description:"vegetarian curry" OR tags:"vegetarian curry"
    | LIMIT 1000
  """

# -----------------------------------------------
# Step 13: Weight different fields ‚öñÔ∏è
# -----------------------------------------------

    | KEEP title, description, tags, _score
    | SORT _score DESC
    | LIMIT 1000
  """
}

# ‚úÖ The response includes documents with title matches ranked higher.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Step 14: Use query string for complex patterns üß©
# -----------------------------------------------
# The QSTR function enables powerful search patterns using a compact query language.
# It's ideal for when you need wildcards, fuzzy matching, and boolean logic in a single expression

POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM kibana_sample_data_esql
    | WHERE QSTR("(fluff* AND pancak*) OR (creamy -vegan)", {"default_field": "description"})
    | KEEP title, description
    | LIMIT 1000
  """
}

# ‚úÖ The response includes documents matching the query string pattern.

# -----------------------------------------------
# Step 15: Advanced relevance scoring (custom score) üèÜ
# -----------------------------------------------

POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM kibana_sample_data_esql METADATA _score

# ‚úÖ The response includes documents scored and filtered by custom logic.
# Notice how EVAL expressions will append new columns to the result set.
