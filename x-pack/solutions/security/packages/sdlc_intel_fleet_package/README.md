## Build zip

From this directory:

```bash
cd sdlc_intel-0.1.0
zip -r ../.target/sdlc_intel-0.1.0.zip .
```

Install via **Fleet → Integrations → Upload integration** (or your local package registry workflow).

## Fleet integration vars

When adding the integration policy, set:

| Var | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `github_connector_id` | Kibana `.github` connector ID — auto-substituted into workflow YAML on install |
| `slack_connector_id` | Kibana `.slack2` connector ID |
| `org_login` | GitHub organization login (default: `elastic`) — replaces `REPLACE_WITH_ORG_LOGIN` in GitHub workflows |
| `salesforce_connector_id` | Kibana `.salesforce` connector ID — feedback-loop Case ingest |
| `salesforce_case_github_field` | Salesforce Case custom field API name for GitHub issue URL (default: `Engineering_Issue_URL__c`) |
| `sdh_repo_pattern` | GitHub search repo qualifier for SDH repos (default: `sdh-*`) |
| `sdh_label` | GitHub label for SDH issues in product repos (default: `sdh`) |
| `salesforce_product_area_field` | Salesforce Case product area field (default: `Product_Area__c`) |
| `google_drive_connector_id` | Google Drive (`.google_drive`) connector ID for design-doc workflows |
| `gdrive_roadmap_folder_ids` | Comma-separated shared Drive folder IDs for roadmap catalog (`multi: true`) |
| `ai_connector_id` | Inference connector ID for SDLC agentic workflows (`ai.agent` steps) |

If vars are unset, workflows retain `REPLACE_WITH_*` placeholders for manual editing.

## ILM retention

Fleet installs `elasticsearch/ilm_policy/sdlc_intel_retention.json` during package install (unless Fleet internal ILM is disabled). All 25 index templates reference `index.lifecycle.name: sdlc_intel_retention`.

| Phase | Age | Action |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Hot | 0 | Priority 100 |
| Warm | 30 days | Priority 50 |
| Delete | 365 days | Delete backing index |

Indices use fixed names with workflow upserts (not data streams). ILM delete applies to the **index age**, not per-document `@timestamp`. After 365 days from index creation, Elasticsearch deletes the entire backing index; workflows recreate it on the next run. Tune the delete phase in a forked policy if your deployment needs longer retention.

## Ingest workflows

Workflows use connector ingest actions (`github.runQueryTemplate`, `slack2.listUsers`, `slack2.getChannelHistory`, `slack2.getConversationReplies`, etc.).

1. Create **GitHub** (`.github`) and **Slack** (`.slack2`) connectors with appropriate OAuth scopes.
2. Install this Fleet package (creates index templates, ILM policy, dashboards; installs workflow YAML when `workflowsManagement` is available).
3. Add an integration policy with connector IDs, or set `consts` manually and enable workflows.

### GitHub workflows

| Workflow | Schedule | Template / action | Target index |
|----------|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **catalog repos** | daily | `orgCatalog.repos` | `github-intel-repos` |
| **catalog teams** | daily | `orgCatalog.teams` | `github-intel-teams` |
| **catalog org members** | daily | `orgCatalog.members` | `github-intel-people` |
| **catalog team members** | daily | `orgCatalog.teamMembers` | `github-intel-people`, `github-intel-relationships` |
| **catalog projects** | daily | `orgCatalog.projects` | `github-intel-projects` |
| **catalog project items** | daily | `orgCatalog.projectItems` | `github-intel-project-items` |
| **catalog project views** | daily | `orgCatalog.projectViews` | `github-intel-project-views` |
| **activity issues** | every 30m | `activity.searchIssues` | `github-intel-issues` |
| **activity pull requests** | every 30m | `activity.searchPullRequests` | `github-intel-pull-requests` |
| **enrich issues graph** | hourly | `graph.issueGraph` | `github-intel-issues`, `github-intel-comments`, `github-intel-relationships` |
| **enrich PRs graph** | hourly | `graph.pullRequestGraph` | `github-intel-pull-requests`, `github-intel-relationships` |
| **normalize project items** | every 6h | ES field parse + `fields[]` | `github-intel-project-items` |
| **build team dimension** | daily | team catalog projection | `sdlc-team-dimension` |
| **cross-link entities** | every 2h | PR/issue/project edges + PR state rollup | `github-intel-relationships`, `github-intel-project-items` |
| **project epic phases** | every 6h | Epic projection | `sdlc-epic-phases` |
| **enrich epic phases** | every 6h | Child tickets, merged PRs, phase gates | `sdlc-epic-phases`, `github-intel-epic-tickets` |
| **build release calendar** | every 12h | Epic release projection | `sdlc-release-calendar` |

**Recommended order:** catalog (repos → teams → org members → team members → projects → project items → project views) → **normalize project items** → **build team dimension** → **project epic phases** → **build release calendar** → activity (issues → PRs) → enrichment (issues graph → PRs graph) → **cross-link entities** → **enrich epic phases**.

### Slack workflows

| Workflow | Schedule | Action | Target index |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| **catalog users** | daily | `slack2.listUsers` | `slack-intel-people` |
| **channel history** | hourly | `slack2.getChannelHistory` | `slack-intel-messages` |
| **thread replies** | every 2h | `slack2.getConversationReplies` | `slack-intel-messages` |

Slack OAuth scopes must include `channels:history`, `groups:history`, `users:read`, and channel read scopes.

### Salesforce + SDH feedback loop (Phase C1)

| Workflow | Schedule | Action / template | Target index |
|----------|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **catalog cases** | hourly | `salesforce.soqlIngest` | `salesforce-intel-cases` |
| **catalog SDH issues** | hourly | `activity.searchIssues` (`repo:sdh-*`) | `github-intel-sdh-issues` |
| **cross-link feedback loop** | every 2h | Case URL field + SDH body CaseNumber search | `github-intel-relationships`, case/SDH indices |

**Recommended order:** **catalog cases** → **catalog SDH issues** → **cross-link feedback loop**.

Configure a `.salesforce` connector with OAuth API access. Set `salesforce_case_github_field` to your Case custom field that stores the GitHub issue URL. SDH issues are indexed separately from product-repo `github-intel-issues` (Option B).

Cross-link writes `customer_case_links_sdh` relationship edges when:

1. A Case stores a GitHub issue URL in the configured Salesforce field and a matching SDH issue exists.
2. An SDH issue title/body contains a Salesforce `CaseNumber` for an unlinked Case.

### Phase C2 — SDH → product engineering plane

| Workflow | Schedule | Action / template | Target index |
|----------|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **catalog SDH labeled issues** | hourly | `activity.searchIssues` (`label:sdh`) | `github-intel-sdh-issues` |
| **cross-link SDH to product** | every 2h | SDH body product-issue URL search | `github-intel-relationships`, `github-intel-sdh-issues` |

**Extended order:** C1 workflows → **catalog SDH labeled issues** → **github-activity-issues** → **cross-link SDH to product**.

Phase C2 adds:

- **`sdh_links_product`** edges when an SDH issue body references a product-repo GitHub issue URL
- **`label:sdh`** ingest path for SDH issues tracked in product repos (not only `sdh-*` repos)
- **`salesforce_product_area_field`** on Cases for team/product taxonomy joins
- **`sdlc-feedback-loop-enriched-view`** ES\|QL view: Case → SDH → product issue (LOOKUP JOIN)
- Ingest health dashboard now includes `salesforce-intel-sync-state` checkpoints

Relationship types in `github-intel-relationships`:

| Relation | From | To |
|----------|------|-----|
| `customer_case_links_sdh` | Salesforce Case Id | SDH issue URL |
| `sdh_links_product` | SDH issue URL | Product issue URL |

### Phase D — Google Drive design docs (metadata only)

Closes the **intent vs execution** gap: GitHub/SDH issues are the execution layer; roadmap docs in Drive (PRDs, OKRs, release decision docs) are the planning layer.

Two complementary signals (metadata only — no file content in Elasticsearch):

```text
Signal 1 — configured roadmap folders (intent catalog)
  gdrive-catalog-roadmap-docs
    → gdrive-intel-documents (links.catalog_source = roadmap_folder)

Signal 2 — issue body URL extraction (execution references)
  github-extract-drive-links
    → gdrive-intel-documents (links.catalog_source = issue_body_url)
    → github-intel-relationships (issue_references_design_doc)
```

| Workflow | Schedule | Action | Target index |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| **catalog roadmap docs** (optional) | daily | `parseCommaSeparatedIds` + `listFilesIngest` per folder | `gdrive-intel-documents` |
| **extract Drive links** | every 2h | `parseDriveUrlsFromText` + `getFileMetadata` | `gdrive-intel-documents`, `github-intel-relationships` |

**Recommended order:** Set `gdrive_roadmap_folder_ids` (for example Team Roadmaps, Product Specs, OKRs) → enable **gdrive-catalog-roadmap-docs** → run GitHub activity + SDH catalogs → **github-extract-drive-links**.

Join targets in `github-extract-drive-links`:

- **Epic/product issues** (`github-intel-issues`) — `issue_target: epic` when `hierarchy.ticket_type == Epic`, else `product`
- **SDH issues** (`github-intel-sdh-issues`) — `issue_target: sdh`

Example analytics enabled by `sdlc-design-doc-coverage-view`:

- Epic linked to roadmap doc, doc last modified months before epic closed → delivery may have diverged from spec
- Roadmap doc in configured folder with no linked GitHub epic → planning without tracked execution
- Roadmap doc owner email ≠ epic assignee → cross-team ownership gap

Do **not** bulk-download Google Docs content into Elasticsearch. Agents can call `downloadFile` on demand.

### Phase E — Agentic workflows (read-only analysis)

Two workflow-backed agents synthesize over existing SDLC indices and persist structured output to `sdlc-agent-insights`:

| Workflow | Schedule | Fleet agent (after install) | Purpose |
|----------|----------|----------------------------|---------|
| **agent coverage analysis** | daily | `fleet-{space}-sdlc_intel-sdlc-coverage-analysis` | Thin epics, roadmap ownership gaps, failing phase gates |
| **agent scope alignment** | every 12h | `fleet-{space}-sdlc_intel-sdlc-scope-alignment` | PR scope vs linked issue/epic intent |

**Prerequisites:** `agentBuilder` + `workflowsManagement` enabled, `ai_connector_id` set on the integration policy, GitHub ingest + epic enrichment workflows populated.

**Fleet-installed agents** — definitions ship under `kibana/agent/*.yaml` and are created as persisted Agent Builder agents on package install (no `security_solution` code). Agents use platform ES\|QL + integration knowledge tools only; schema semantics come from `docs/knowledge_base/`.

No GitHub writes — findings land in `sdlc-agent-insights` only (NFR-003).

### Phase F — Knowledge base and alerting templates (available today)

**Integration knowledge base** — indexed automatically on package install from markdown under `docs/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/knowledge_base/sdlc-github-data-model.md` | Index families, relationships, common fields |
| `docs/knowledge_base/sdlc-epic-phases-schema.md` | Phase gates, rollup fields, example ES\|QL |
| `docs/knowledge_base/sdlc-team-dimension-guide.md` | Team catalog and ownership coverage |

Requires Enterprise license and **Integrations → Settings → Integration knowledge** enabled. Feeds Agent Builder / AI Assistant context for installed integrations.

**Alerting rule templates** — shipped under `kibana/alerting_rule_template/` (installed as saved object templates):

| Template ID | Detects |
|-------------|---------|
| `sdlc-stale-epic-thin-tickets` | Epics with fewer than 3 child tickets |
| `sdlc-epic-failing-gates` | Epics with `rollup.gates_passed_pct < 100` |
| `sdlc-no-linked-prd` | Roadmap epics missing `links.prd_url` |
| `sdlc-roadmap-unassigned-team` | Roadmap project items without engineering team |

Enable from **Fleet → Integrations → SDLC Intelligence → Alerting** after install. Rules are created **disabled**; add actions/connectors before enabling.

Platform RFC for the generic extension (`KibanaAssetType.agent`): [`docs/PLATFORM_RFC_KIBANA_ASSET_EXTENSIONS.md`](docs/PLATFORM_RFC_KIBANA_ASSET_EXTENSIONS.md) — **P1/P2 implemented** in Fleet + Agent Builder.

## Dashboards

| Dashboard | Data source | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **SDLC Executive roadmap** | `sdlc-epic-phases` | Epic count, coverage, status, roadmap stage |
| **SDLC Project item pipeline** | `sdlc-project-items-enriched-view` | Ticket types, teams, roadmap stages from ES\|QL |
| **SDLC Team dimension** | `sdlc-team-dimension` + `sdlc-epic-phases` | Org teams and epic ownership |
| **SDLC GitHub sync overview** | `sdlc-github-raw-summary-view` | Raw ingest page/item counts per project |
| **SDLC Epic phase gates** | `sdlc-epic-phases` + `sdlc-epic-tickets-by-repo-view` | Child ticket coverage, PR linkage, gate pass rates |
| **SDLC Ingest health** | `sdlc-ingest-health-view` | Checkpoint lag, stale workflows, last run status |
| **SDLC Salesforce feedback loop** | `sdlc-salesforce-feedback-view`, `sdlc-feedback-loop-enriched-view` | Case ↔ SDH linkage and Case → SDH → product three-hop view |
| **SDLC Design doc coverage** | `sdlc-design-doc-coverage-view` | Epic/product/SDH issues linked to Google Drive design docs |

## Fleet workflow and agent auto-install

When the `workflowsManagement` plugin is enabled, Fleet installs package workflows from `kibana/workflow/*.yaml` during package installation. When `agentBuilder` is enabled, Fleet installs persisted agents from `kibana/agent/*.yaml` first, then workflows. IDs follow `fleet-{spaceId}-{pkgName}-{file-base}`.

Connector IDs, org login, Salesforce field names, SDH repo pattern, SDH label, Google Drive connector ID, roadmap folder IDs, and AI connector ID from the integration policy vars replace `REPLACE_WITH_*` placeholders during install. Workflow `agent-id` placeholders `REPLACE_WITH_FLEET_AGENT_{file-base}` resolve to the matching fleet agent ID.

On package uninstall, agent assets are deleted via `agentBuilder.management.deletePackageManagedAgent` and workflow assets via `workflowsManagement.deleteWorkflows`.
