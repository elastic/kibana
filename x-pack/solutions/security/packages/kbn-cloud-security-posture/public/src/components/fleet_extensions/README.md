# Fleet Extensions

Cloud Security Posture integration components for Kibana Fleet.

## 📚 Documentation

- **[TESTING.md](./TESTING.md)** - **READ THIS FIRST** before creating any tests. Contains all testing patterns and best practices.

## 🧪 Testing

**IMPORTANT:** All tests in this directory MUST follow the patterns documented in `TESTING.md`.

### Quick Start

1. Read `TESTING.md` thoroughly
2. Follow the Azure testing pattern (our gold standard)
3. Use integration testing with mocked child components
4. Reference test subjects from `@kbn/cloud-security-posture-common`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all fleet extension tests
yarn test:jest --testPathPattern=fleet_extensions

# Run specific test file
yarn test:jest path/to/test.test.tsx

# Watch mode
yarn test:jest --watch path/to/test.test.tsx
```
