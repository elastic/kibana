/**
 * LLM-judge criteria for Diamond prose quality and the vertex-separation
 * constraints the prompt enforces. Complements the deterministic CODE checks
 * (signal count, literal-IOC leak).
 *
 * Each criterion is atomic and, where it concerns literal indicators or named
 * organisations, explicitly scopes the judgment to the *summary text only* and
 * states that the source article is expected to contain those. The judge
 * otherwise conflates the article containing an IOC with the summary containing
 * it and fails a summary that is actually generic (its own reason then
 * contradicts its verdict). Judged over several samples by majority vote.
