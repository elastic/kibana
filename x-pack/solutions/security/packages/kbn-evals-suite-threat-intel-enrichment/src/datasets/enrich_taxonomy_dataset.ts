 * Curated taxonomy ground truth, keyed by pack id.
 *
 * The pack `categories` / `regions` in `packs.ts` are a verbatim snapshot of the
 * BlackHat demo fixtures, which were authored for a demo rather than for taxonomy
 * grounding: several carried region and category labels the article prose does
 * not actually support (e.g. `europe`/`global` on packs whose text names no such
 * region, or `insider-threat` on external account-takeover reports). Recall
 * against those labels penalised the model for correctly declining a label the
 * text never supports.
 *
 * These labels are instead grounded strictly in what each article states:
 *  - Regions are listed only when the prose names a place. Packs with no
 *    geographic signal use an empty set (recall is trivially satisfied — there is
 *    nothing to recall — rather than demanding an invented region).
 *  - Categories are the report's clearly-supported classes; debatable labels the
 *    text does not substantiate are dropped.
 *
 * `okta` intentionally keeps `cloud-security`: an Okta identity-provider takeover
 * is a cloud-security report, and the model's tendency to omit it is a real
 * recall signal worth tracking, not a mislabelled example.
