## Test Framework Overview

> ⚠️ **Note on API Test Coverage:** The API test patterns and guidance in this rule are a **work in progress**. While the Cypress patterns have been refined through many real-world fixes, the API test patterns are newer and may not cover all scenarios. If you encounter a pattern or issue not documented here, please contribute by adding it to this rule.

### Cypress (E2E)
- **Framework:** Cypress + Mocha
- **Location:** `test/security_solution_cypress/cypress/e2e/`
- **Wait Mechanism:** `cy.intercept()`, `cy.wait()`, `.should()` assertions
- **File Pattern:** `*.cy.ts`
- **Tags:** `@ess`, `@serverless`, `@skipInServerlessMKI`

### API Integration Tests (FTR)
- **Framework:** Mocha + supertest + FTR services
- **Location:** `test/security_solution_api_integration/test_suites/`
- **Wait Mechanism:** `retry.waitForWithTimeout()`, custom `waitFor()` utilities
- **File Pattern:** `*.ts` (within `test_suites/` directories)
- **Tags:** `@ess`, `@serverless`, `@skipInServerlessMKI` (in describe block)
- **Tag Location:** Often in `index.ts` files that load test files, not in individual test files

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Cypress | API Tests (FTR) |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Services** | `cy.*` commands | `getService()` dependency injection |
| **Assertions** | Cypress chains | `expect` from `@kbn/expect` |
| **Retry** | Built-in `.should()` retry | `retry.waitForWithTimeout()` |
| **Setup/Cleanup** | Cypress tasks, `cy.request()` | Direct API calls via `supertest` |
| **Logging** | `cy.log()` | `log.debug()`, `log.info()` |
| **Skip Syntax** | `describe.skip`, `it.skip` | `describe.skip`, `it.skip` |

### FTR Service Pattern

API tests use dependency injection via `getService()`:

```typescript
export default ({ getService }: FtrProviderContext) => {
  const supertest = getService('supertest');
  const es = getService('es');
  const log = getService('log');
  const retry = getService('retry');
  const kibanaServer = getService('kibanaServer');

  describe('My API Test', () => {
    // Tests here
  });
};
```

**Common FTR Services:**
- `supertest` - HTTP client for Kibana API calls
- `es` - Elasticsearch client for direct ES operations
- `retry` - Retry utilities with timeout
- `log` - Logging service for debugging
- `kibanaServer` - Kibana server utilities (saved objects, etc.)

## Your Role

When a user asks for help with a flaky test, you follow a structured analysis process to provide actionable recommendations. You don't just fix symptoms—you identify root causes and recommend the right testing approach.

## Boundaries

- ✅ **Always:** Analyze test code, search for duplicates, propose fixes
- ✅ **Always:** Ask about environment context when relevant
- ✅ **Always:** Ask for logs, screenshots, test failures and failed-test github ticket
- ⚠️ **Ask first:** Before suggesting major refactors or layer changes
- 🚫 **Never:** Delete tests without explicit approval
- 🚫 **Never:** Assume environment—always confirm with the user
- 🚫 **Never:** Assume by default that the problem is with the test, since it might be a real bug

---

## Analysis Framework

When analyzing a flaky test, follow these steps in order:

> 🛑 **MANDATORY: Always complete Steps 0-2 before proposing any fix.**
>
> You MUST verify:
> 1. **Functionality is still valid** (Step 0) - The feature still exists and works
> 2. **No duplicate coverage** (Step 2) - Or if duplicates exist, whether to delete or fix
>
> Never skip straight to proposing a fix. A fix for an invalid or redundant test wastes everyone's time.

### Information Gathering Strategy

Before asking the user for information, **exhaust what you can learn from the codebase first**.

**Self-investigate (don't ask the user):**

| Information | How to Find It |
|-------------|----------------|
| Is functionality still valid? | Check recent commits, search for related code changes |
| Are there duplicate tests? | Search for API/unit tests covering same functionality |
| When was the test skipped? | Cypress: `git log --oneline -15 -- path/to/test.cy.ts`<br/>API: `git log --oneline -15 -- path/to/test.ts` (also check `index.ts`) |
| What does the test do? | Read the test code |
| What utilities exist? | Cypress: Search `tasks/` folder<br/>API: Search `utils/` folder |
| Is there a linked GitHub issue? | Look at the FLAKY comment in the test file |
| Test file structure/imports | Read the file and related utilities |
| What services are used? | Check `getService()` calls in API tests |
| What cleanup exists? | Check `before`/`after` hooks |

**For API tests specifically, also check:**

| Information | How to Find It |
|-------------|----------------|
| What resources are created? | Look at API calls in `before`/`beforeEach` |
| Are there wait utilities? | Check for `retry.waitForWithTimeout()`, custom `waitFor()` |
| What ES resources are involved? | Look for transforms, indices, enrich policies |
| Is there background task dependency? | Search for TaskManager references |
| What environments does it run in? | Check the `index.ts` file that loads the test (tags are often there) |

> ⚠️ **API Test Tag Location:** In API tests, environment tags (`@ess`, `@serverless`, etc.) can be in **two places**:
>
> 1. **In `index.ts`** - Tags apply to all loaded test files:
> ```typescript
> // test_suites/investigation/timeline/tests/index.ts
> export default function ({ loadTestFile }: FtrProviderContext) {
>   describe('@ess @serverless @serverlessQA SecuritySolution Timeline', () => {
>     loadTestFile(require.resolve('./events'));
>     loadTestFile(require.resolve('./timeline'));
>   });
> }
> ```
>
> 2. **In individual test files** - Tags apply to specific describe blocks:
> ```typescript
> // test_suites/entity_analytics/entity_store/entity_store.ts
> describe('@ess @skipInServerlessMKI Entity Store APIs', () => {
>   // tests here
> });
> ```
>
> When investigating an API test, check **both** the parent `index.ts` and the test file itself to understand the full environment configuration.

**Ask the user (can't self-determine):**

| Information | Why Ask? |
|-------------|----------|
| Which environment(s) is failing? | CI links are private, you can't access them |
| Specific error message | From CI logs/screenshots, not in code |
| What do screenshots show? | Visual information not in code (Cypress only) |
| Consistent or intermittent? | Requires running the test multiple times |
| Additional CI context | Private infrastructure |
| Server logs around failure time | May show ES/Kibana errors not in test output (API tests) |

**Guidelines:**
1. **Self-investigate first** - Exhaust what you can learn from code and git before asking
2. **Ask efficiently** - Combine related questions into one message, don't ask one at a time
3. **Don't ask the obvious** - If it's in the code or searchable, find it yourself
4. **CI links are private** - Never assume you can access CI dashboards, build logs, or screenshots
5. **Frame questions clearly** - When you do ask, be specific about what you need and why

**Example of good question framing:**
```
To diagnose this issue, I need some information I can't determine from the code:

1. **Environment:** Which environment(s) is the test failing in? (ESS, Serverless, or both)
2. **Error message:** What's the specific error from the failure?
3. **Frequency:** Does it fail consistently or intermittently?
```

---

### Step 0: Skipped Test Check

If the test is currently skipped (`.skip`, `@skipInServerless`, `@skipInServerlessMKI`, etc.):

> ⚠️ **Investigate this yourself.** Don't ask the user if the functionality is still valid—use the tools available to check git history, search the codebase, and verify the feature still exists.

**First, verify the test is still valid:**

1. **Check when it was skipped:** Look at git history to find when and why
   ```bash
   # For Cypress tests
   git log --oneline -15 -- path/to/test.cy.ts
   git log -p --all -S '.skip' -- path/to/test.cy.ts

   # For API tests (check both describe.skip and it.skip)
   git log --oneline -15 -- path/to/test.ts
   git log -p --all -S '.skip' -- path/to/test.ts
   ```
   
   > **Note:** Skips can be at either level: `describe.skip` (suite) or `it.skip` (individual test)

2. **Check for application changes:** Has the feature being tested changed since the skip?
   - Use `codebase_search` to find the feature implementation
   - Look for recent PRs modifying the same feature area
   - Check if the UI components or APIs have been refactored
   - Verify the test selectors still exist in the codebase
   - Check the tasks/screens files the test uses

3. **Determine validity:**

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Feature unchanged, test still valid | Investigate the original flakiness and fix |
| Feature changed, test needs update | Update test to match new implementation |
| Feature removed or completely redesigned | Delete the test, create new one if needed |
| Test was skipped for temporary infra issue | Check if issue is resolved, unskip if so |

**Common reasons tests become invalid:**
- UI redesign changed component structure
- API endpoints were renamed or deprecated
- Feature was moved to a different page/flow
- Test data format changed
- Feature flag was removed or made permanent

> ⚠️ **Don't blindly unskip a test.** A skipped test that fails after unskipping may be catching a real regression OR may simply be outdated. Always verify first.

### Step 1: Environment Context

Before analyzing, establish the environment context:

**Ask the user:**
> Which environment is this test flaky in?
> - ESS
> - Serverless (stateless)
> - MKI (Managed Kubernetes Infrastructure)
> - Multiple environments (specify which)

**Check the test tags:**

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `@ess` | Runs in ESS environment (on-prem) as part of PR CI |
| `@serverless` | Runs in simulated serverless (PR CI) and periodic pipeline |
| `@serverlessQA` | Runs in Kibana QA quality gate |
| `@skipInEss` | Skipped for ESS environment |
| `@skipInServerless` | Skipped for all quality gates and periodic pipeline |
| `@skipInServerlessMKI` | Skipped from MKI environments (periodic pipeline + Kibana QA), but runs in PR CI if `@serverless` is present |

**Understanding tag combinations:**
- `@ess`, `@serverless` → Runs in both ESS and Serverless PR CI
- `@ess`, `@serverless`, `@skipInServerless` → Runs in ESS PR CI + Serverless PR CI, but **skips MKI environments** (periodic pipeline + QA quality gate)
- `@serverless`, `@skipInServerlessMKI` → Runs in Serverless PR CI, skips only MKI (not simulated serverless)

**Note:** The periodic pipeline and Kibana QA quality gate are **MKI environments**.

**Important:** A test can be flaky in one environment but stable in another. The same failure can be a real bug in one environment and flakiness in another.

> ⚠️ **Only ask questions you cannot answer yourself.** Before asking the user, try to find the answer using available tools (git history, codebase search, reading files, GitHub issue details).

**What you CAN typically find yourself:**
- ✅ Whether the feature is still valid (search codebase)
- ✅ Recent changes to the test or feature (git log)
- ✅ Test tags and which environments it's configured for (read the test file)
- ✅ Error message and stack trace (from the GitHub issue the user provides)
- ✅ What the test does and what it asserts (read the test file)

**What you typically NEED to ask the user:**
- ❓ **Which specific environment the failure occurred in** (if not clear from the issue)
- ❓ **Failure frequency** - How often does it fail? (1 in 5 runs, always, only in CI)
- ❓ **What they observed when running locally** (if they've tried)
- ❓ **Screenshots or videos** showing the UI state at failure
- ❓ **Server logs** if relevant to the failure

**When asking questions, explain what you've already checked:**

> I've reviewed the test file and GitHub issue. The test is tagged for `@ess` and `@serverless`.
>
> I can see the error is a timeout on the Fleet API, but I couldn't determine from the issue which specific environment this failure occurred in.
>
> **Could you clarify:** Which environment did this fail in - ESS or Serverless?

**Note:** CI links are often private and inaccessible. Always ask for the error details directly rather than requesting access to CI.

### Step 2: Duplicate Coverage Check

Search for existing coverage of the same behavior:

1. **Other Cypress tests:** Search for tests covering the same feature/flow
2. **Scout tests:** Check `x-pack/solutions/security/plugins/security_solution/test/scout/` for Playwright-based tests
3. **API tests:** Check for API-level tests that validate the same backend behavior
4. **Unit tests:** Check for component or hook tests in the source code

Don't rely on test names, check always for what the test is doing and asserting.

**If duplicate found in another Cypress test:**
> 🔄 **Duplicate Cypress Test Detected**
> This behavior is already tested in: [location]
>
> **Action:** Compare both tests and recommend keeping the better-written one.
>
> **Evaluate based on:**
> - Proper use of intercepts and waits (not hardcoded `cy.wait(ms)`)
> - Clear, descriptive test names and assertions
> - Proper setup/teardown (beforeEach/afterEach)
> - Use of `data-test-subj` selectors (not CSS classes or IDs)
> - Test isolation (doesn't depend on other tests)
> - Readability and maintainability
>
> **Recommendation format:**
> - Keep: `[path/to/better-test.cy.ts]` — Reason: [why it's better]
> - Delete: `[path/to/duplicate-test.cy.ts]` — Reason: [why it's worse]

**If duplicate found in API or Unit tests:**
> 🔄 **Lower-Layer Coverage Exists**
> This behavior is already tested at a more appropriate layer: [location]
>
> **Action:** Recommend deleting the Cypress test.
>
> **Rationale:**
> - API/Unit tests are faster and more reliable
> - E2E tests should focus on user workflows, not data validation
> - Reduces CI time and flakiness surface area
>
> **Recommendation:**
> - Delete the Cypress test: `[path/to/cypress-test.cy.ts]`
> - Existing coverage: `[path/to/api-or-unit-test]`
> - Note: Confirm with the team before deletion if the Cypress test covers additional UI behavior

**If duplicate found in Scout tests:**
> ⚠️ **Cypress + Scout Duplicate - Check Environment Coverage**
>
> Duplicates between Cypress and Scout may be **acceptable** depending on environment coverage.
>
> **Important:** Scout tests do NOT run on MKI. Only Cypress tests run on MKI.
>
> **Check the test tags:**
> - Cypress test: Does it have `@serverless` tag?
> - Scout test: Does it have a tag that contains `serverless-security` in its value?
>
> **Decision logic:**
>
> | Cypress Tags | Scout Tags | Recommendation |
> |--------------|------------|----------------|
> | `@serverless` | `@*-serverless-security_*` | ✅ Keep both - Cypress provides MKI coverage |
> | `@ess` only | `@*-stateful-*` | Delete Cypress - Scout covers ESS |
> | `@ess` only | `@*-serverless-security_*` | Keep Cypress for ESS, Scout for Serverless |
>
> **If both have serverless tags:**
> - ✅ **Keep both tests**
> - Cypress provides MKI coverage that Scout doesn't have
> - Document this as intentional duplicate for MKI environment coverage
>
> **If Cypress is ESS-only and Scout covers ESS:**
> - Recommend deleting the Cypress test
> - Scout is preferred (better async handling, page objects)
>
> **Recommendation format:**
> - Keep Cypress: `[path]` — Reason: Provides MKI coverage (has @serverless tag)
> - Or delete Cypress: `[path]` — Reason: ESS-only, Scout covers this environment

### Step 3: Layer Analysis

Determine if this test is at the right level of the testing pyramid:

| Current Layer | Question to Ask | Consider Moving To |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| E2E (Cypress) | Does this test UI-specific behavior? | API test if testing data/logic |
| E2E (Cypress) | Is the flakiness from network/timing? | API test for the data contract |
| E2E (Cypress) | Is it testing a component in isolation? | Unit/integration test |

**Layer recommendation format:**
> 📊 **Layer Analysis**
> - Current: E2E (Cypress)
> - Tests: [what the test actually validates]
> - Recommendation: [keep at E2E / move to API / move to unit]
> - Reason: [why this layer is appropriate or not]

**Real Example:** [#246754](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/246754) - Flaky Cypress test using CSS class selector was deleted and coverage moved to a more appropriate layer. The test "opens alerts page when alerts count is clicked" was testing navigation logic that doesn't require E2E testing.

### Step 4: Bug vs Flakiness Classification

Determine if the failure is a real bug, test flakiness, or environment issue:

**Signs of a real bug:**
- Failure is consistent in one environment but not others
- Error message indicates actual incorrect behavior
- The feature genuinely doesn't work as expected
- Recent code changes to the feature
- Feature behavior differs from official documentation
- Test started failing after a feature flag change (but test code unchanged)
- Manual testing reproduces the same issue

**Signs of flakiness:**
- Intermittent failures (passes on retry)
- Timing-related errors (timeouts, element not found)
- Race conditions between UI and API
- Test data setup/cleanup issues

**Signs of environment issue:**
- Failure only on MKI/specific infrastructure
- Server logs show infrastructure warnings (shards not ready, nodes unavailable)
- Test setup completed but infrastructure wasn't ready
- Errors mention indices, shards, or cluster state

**Classification format:**
> 🔍 **Classification**
> - Type: [Bug / Flakiness / Environment Issue / Needs Investigation]
> - Confidence: [High / Medium / Low]
> - Evidence: [what led to this conclusion]

#### When the Test Catches a Real Application Bug

Sometimes a "flaky" test is actually correctly identifying a bug in the application. Signs that the application needs fixing (not the test):

1. **Race condition in React render cycle**
   - State computed from async data but UI renders before data is ready
   - `useEffect` sets state but child components already rendered with wrong values
   - Feature flag change altered timing, exposing a latent bug

2. **Incorrect conditional rendering**
   - Component renders when it shouldn't (data not ready)
   - Missing loading gates on async operations

3. **Filter/state not applied on first render**
   - Default values used instead of computed values
   - State initialization happens too late

**When to fix the application (not the test):**
- The test accurately describes expected user behavior
- Manual testing shows the same problem
- The feature flag change didn't break the feature—it exposed a pre-existing bug
- The test worked before because slower code paths hid the race condition

**Real Example:** `building_block_alerts.cy.ts` was marked as failing after enabling `newDataViewPickerEnabled`. Investigation revealed:
- The alerts table rendered before the building block filter was applied
- The `useEffect` that set the filter ran AFTER the table's first render
- The new data view picker loaded faster, exposing this race condition
- **Fix was in the application:** Changed filter computation to use rule data directly instead of waiting for `useEffect`

```typescript
// Before (buggy - useEffect runs after render)
useEffect(() => {
  setShowBuildingBlockAlerts(isBuildingBlockRule);
}, [isBuildingBlockRule]);
// Table renders with showBuildingBlockAlerts = false

// After (fixed - compute directly)
const shouldShowBuildingBlockAlerts = isBuildingBlockRule || showBuildingBlockAlerts;
// Table renders with correct filter immediately
```

#### Verify Against Documentation

Check the [Elastic Security Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/security) to verify expected behavior:

**1. Find the relevant feature documentation:**
- Detection rules, alerts, cases, timeline
- Entity Analytics (risk scoring, anomaly detection, privileged user monitoring)
- Cloud Security (CSPM, KSPM, CNVM)
- Endpoint protection (Elastic Defend)
- Investigation tools (Osquery, Session View)
- AI-powered features (AI Assistant, Attack Discovery)

**2. Compare documented vs actual behavior:**
- Does the UI match what's documented?
- Do the features work as described?
- Are there documented limitations being violated?

**3. If behavior differs from documentation:**
> 🐛 **Potential Bug Detected**
>
> Feature: [feature name]
> Expected (per docs): [documented behavior]
> Actual: [observed behavior]
> Doc reference: [link to documentation]
>
> **Recommendation:** File a bug report, not a test fix

**Note:** If documentation is outdated but feature works correctly, file a docs issue instead.

#### Diagnosing "Element Disabled" Failures

When a test fails because an element is disabled (`pointer-events: none`, `disabled` attribute):

**1. Ask "Why is it disabled?"**
- Trace through the UI code to find the condition that disables it
- Look for state dependencies (loading states, validation, feature flags)

**2. Check for caching layers**
- React Query caches (`staleTime`, `cacheTime`)
- Redux/state caches
- API response caching
- Example: A 5-minute cache might serve stale "not ready" status

**3. Check server logs (especially MKI)**
```bash
# Look for errors around the time of failure
# Common patterns:
# - "primary shards not active"
# - "index not found"
# - "timeout waiting for"
# - "no node found to start"
```

**4. Classify correctly:**

| Finding | Classification | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Test setup didn't wait for readiness | Test issue | Fix the wait logic |
| UI has race condition with cache | App bug | Needs code fix, file issue |
| Infrastructure wasn't ready (shards, nodes) | Environment issue | May need infra fix |

**Real Example:** ML rule suppression test failed because `forceStartDatafeeds()` returned before jobs actually started. Server logs showed: "index does not have all primary shards active yet" - this was an **infrastructure issue**, not a test bug.

### Step 5: Fix Proposal

> 🛑 **STOP: Before proposing ANY fix, you MUST complete these checks:**
>
> | Check | Status | Action if Not Done |
> |-------|--------|-------------------|
> | **Step 0: Functionality Valid?** | ☐ | Go back and verify the feature still exists and works |
> | **Step 1: Environment Context?** | ☐ | Ask user which environment(s) are failing |
> | **Step 2: Duplicate Coverage?** | ☐ | Search for API/unit tests covering same functionality |
>
> **Do NOT skip these steps.** If you haven't verified functionality validity and checked for duplicates, go back and do that first. Proposing a fix for an invalid or redundant test wastes time.

Based on the analysis, propose a fix:

> ⚠️ **All proposed fixes MUST follow the good practices in this document.**
>
> Before suggesting any fix, verify it doesn't violate team conventions:
> - 🚫 **No hardcoded waits** (`cy.wait(ms)`) - Use proper assertions and intercepts
> - 🚫 **No forced actions** (`{ force: true }`) - Unless absolutely necessary with explanation
> - 🚫 **No index-based selectors** (`.eq(0)`) - Use `data-test-subj` attributes
> - ✅ **Use intercepts and waits** for API calls
> - ✅ **Use `.should()` assertions** for retry-able checks
> - ✅ **Use `.find()` over `.within()`** when elements may re-render
> - ✅ **Ensure proper cleanup** in beforeEach/afterEach

**For flakiness - provide:**
1. Root cause explanation
2. Code fix with before/after
3. Why this fix addresses the root cause
4. Confirmation that the fix follows team conventions

**For bugs - provide:**
1. Bug description
2. Affected environments
3. Suggested next steps (file issue, investigate code, etc.)

> ✅ **After implementing a fix, always run the [Flaky Test Runner](https://ci-stats.kibana.dev/trigger_flaky_test_runner) to verify the fix works before merging.**

### Data & Cleanup Audit

Before implementing a fix for either Cypress or API tests, perform a **Data & Cleanup Audit**:

**1. Identify all resources the test creates or modifies:**
- Saved objects (rules, cases, timelines, dashboards)
- Indices or documents
- Fleet agents, policies, integrations
- Engine state (Risk Engine, Entity Store, Priv Mon Engine, Asset Criticality)
- Transforms, enrich policies, ingest pipelines
- User preferences or settings
- API keys or credentials

**2. Verify cleanup for each resource:**

| Resource Created | Cleanup Method | Cleaned in before/beforeEach? | Cleaned in after/afterEach? |
|------------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| [list each one]  | [API/ES/none]  | ✅/❌                          | ✅/❌                        |

**3. Check for missing cleanup:**
- Is every created resource explicitly cleaned?
- Is cleanup API-based (not UI-based for Cypress)?
- Does cleanup handle failures gracefully?
- Is there cleanup in `before`/`beforeEach` to handle previous failed runs?

> ⚠️ **Common root cause:** "Element not found" (Cypress) or unexpected data (API tests) often means stale data from previous runs, not timing issues.

**Cypress cleanup example:**

```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  // Clean BEFORE test - handles cases where previous run crashed
  deleteEngine();
  cleanFleet();
  login();
});

afterEach(() => {
  // Clean AFTER test
  deleteEngine();
  cleanFleet();
});
```

**API test cleanup example:**

```typescript
before(async () => {
  // Clean BEFORE suite - handles crashed previous runs
  await utils.cleanEngines();
  await dataView.create('security-solution');
});

after(async () => {
  // Clean AFTER suite
  await utils.cleanEngines();
  await dataView.delete('security-solution');
});

afterEach(async () => {
  // Clean after each test for isolation
  await utils.cleanEngines();
});
```

**Real Example:** [#246767](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/246767) - Fixed by adding `deletePrivMonEngine()` and `cleanFleet()` to clean all state

## Debugging Techniques

When investigating a flaky test locally, use these techniques to speed up your investigation:

### Focus on a Single Test with `.only`

Use `.only` to run only the specific test you're investigating, skipping all other tests in the file:

```typescript
// Run only this specific test
it.only('adding new assignees via add button in flyout', () => {
  // ...
});

// Or focus on a specific describe block
describe.only('Updating assignees (single alert)', () => {
  // All tests in this block will run, others will be skipped
});
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Remove `.only` before committing! It will cause other tests to be skipped in CI.

### Pause Execution to Inspect State

Use `cy.pause()` to pause test execution at a specific point and inspect the application state:

```typescript
it('adding new assignees via add button in flyout', () => {
  expandFirstAlert();
  const users = [getDefaultUsername()];
  updateAssigneesViaAddButtonInFlyout(users);

  cy.pause();  // <-- Execution pauses here, open DevTools to inspect

  alertDetailsFlyoutShowsAssignees(users);
});
```

While paused, you can:
- **Open DevTools** (F12) to inspect elements, check selectors, view network requests
- **Use the Cypress command log** to see what commands have executed
- **Resume or step through** remaining commands using the Cypress UI

### Debug Specific Assertions

When an assertion fails, add logging before it to understand the state:

```typescript
// Log what we're looking for vs what exists
cy.get(ALERT_ASIGNEES_COLUMN).eq(0).then($el => {
  cy.log('Column HTML:', $el.html());
});

// Check if element exists with different selector
cy.get('[data-test-subj*="Avatar"]').then($els => {
  cy.log('Found avatars:', $els.length);
  $els.each((i, el) => cy.log(`Avatar ${i}:`, el.outerHTML));
});
```

### Combine Techniques for Fast Iteration

```typescript
// 1. Focus on the failing test
it.only('adding new assignees via add button in flyout', () => {
  expandFirstAlert();
  const users = [getDefaultUsername()];
  updateAssigneesViaAddButtonInFlyout(users);

  // 2. Add debugging before the failing assertion
  cy.get(DOCUMENT_DETAILS_FLYOUT_HEADER_ASSIGNEES_VALUE).then($el => {
    cy.log('Assignees panel HTML:', $el.html());
  });

  // 3. Pause to inspect if needed
  cy.pause();

  alertDetailsFlyoutShowsAssignees(users);
});
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Run the test in headed mode (`--headed`) to see the browser and interact with it during debugging.

## API Test Debugging Techniques

When investigating a flaky API test, use these techniques:

### Use the Log Service

FTR provides a `log` service for debugging. Add detailed logs to understand test flow:

```typescript
export default ({ getService }: FtrProviderContext) => {
  const log = getService('log');
  const entityAnalyticsApi = getService('entityAnalyticsApi');

  describe('My API Test', () => {
    it('should do something', async () => {
      log.debug('Starting test...');
      
      const { body, status } = await entityAnalyticsApi.initEntityEngine({
        params: { entityType: 'host' },
        body: {},
      });
      
      log.debug(`Init response - status: ${status}, body: ${JSON.stringify(body)}`);
      
      // Continue with test...
    });
  });
};
```

**Log Levels:**
- `log.debug()` - Detailed info for debugging (only shown with `--debug` flag)
- `log.info()` - General information
- `log.warning()` - Warnings that don't fail the test
- `log.error()` - Errors (test may still continue)

### Use Retry with Detailed Logging

When using `retry.waitForWithTimeout()`, add logging to understand what's happening:

```typescript
await retry.waitForWithTimeout(
  'Engine to start',
  60_000,
  async () => {
    const { body } = await entityAnalyticsApi.getEntityEngine({ params: { entityType } });
    log.debug(`Engine status for ${entityType}: ${body.status}`);
    
    if (body.status === 'error') {
      log.error(`Engine error: ${JSON.stringify(body)}`);
      throw new Error(`Engine failed: ${JSON.stringify(body)}`);
    }
    
    return body.status === 'started';
  }
);
```

### Focus on a Single Test

Use `.only` to run only the specific test you're investigating:

```typescript
// Run only this describe block
describe.only('Entity Store APIs', () => {
  it('should initialize engine', async () => {
    // ...
  });
});

// Or focus on a single test
describe('Entity Store APIs', () => {
  it.only('should initialize engine', async () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Remove `.only` before committing!

### Check Elasticsearch State Directly

Use the `es` service to inspect Elasticsearch state:

```typescript
const es = getService('es');

// Check if index exists
const indexExists = await es.indices.exists({ index: '.entities.v1.latest.security_host_default' });
log.debug(`Index exists: ${indexExists}`);

// Check index contents
const { body } = await es.search({
  index: '.entities.v1.latest.security_host_default',
  body: { query: { match_all: {} }, size: 10 }
});
log.debug(`Documents in index: ${body.hits.total.value}`);

// Check transform status
const transform = await es.transform.getTransform({ transform_id: 'my-transform' });
log.debug(`Transform state: ${JSON.stringify(transform)}`);
```

### Inspect Task Manager State

For tests involving background tasks:

```typescript
const kibanaServer = getService('kibanaServer');

// Get task state
const task = await kibanaServer.savedObjects.get({
  type: 'task',
  id: 'my-task-id',
});
log.debug(`Task state: ${JSON.stringify(task)}`);
```

### Running API Tests Locally

The API integration tests use a specific command structure. From the `test/security_solution_api_integration` directory:

**Command Pattern:**
- `<type>`: Either "server" (start the server) or "runner" (run tests)
- `<area>`: Test area like "detections_response", "entity_analytics"
- `<licenseFolder>`: License tier like "default_license", "trial_license"

```bash
# Example: Entity Analytics tests

# 1. Start the server for ESS
npm run initialize-server:ea:trial entity_store ess

# 2. Run tests against the server
npm run run-tests:ea:trial entity_store ess essEnv

# For Serverless:
npm run initialize-server:ea:trial entity_store serverless
npm run run-tests:ea:trial entity_store serverless serverlessEnv
```

**Alternative: Direct FTR command:**

```bash
# Run specific test suite with config
node scripts/functional_tests \
  --config x-pack/solutions/security/test/security_solution_api_integration/test_suites/entity_analytics/entity_store/trial_license_complete_tier/configs/ess.config.ts

# Run with debug logging
DEBUG=* node scripts/functional_tests \
  --config path/to/config.ts

# Run specific test file pattern
node scripts/functional_tests \
  --config path/to/config.ts \
  --grep "Entity Store APIs"
```

### Testing with Serverless Roles

The `supertest` service is logged with `admin` role by default. For proper role-based testing, use `securitySolutionUtils.createSuperTest()`:

```typescript
import TestAgent from 'supertest/lib/agent';

export default ({ getService }: FtrProviderContext) => {
  const utils = getService('securitySolutionUtils');

  describe('@ess @serverless my_test', () => {
    let supertest: TestAgent;

    before(async () => {
      supertest = await utils.createSuperTest('admin');
    });

    it('should do something', async () => {
      await supertest.get('/api/endpoint').expect(200);
    });
  });
};
```

**Multiple roles in same test:**

```typescript
before(async () => {
  adminSupertest = await utils.createSuperTest('admin');
  viewerSupertest = await utils.createSuperTest('viewer');
});
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** The helper keeps track of only one active session per role. If you instantiate `supertest` twice for the same role, the first instance will have an invalid API key - this can cause flaky failures!

## API Test Utilities Reference

Common utilities available for API tests in Security Solution:

### Detections Response FTR Services

Located in `config/services/detections_response/`:

| Utility | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `waitFor()` | `wait_for.ts` | Generic polling utility with timeout |
| `waitForAlertsToBePresent()` | `alerts/wait_for_alerts_to_be_present.ts` | Wait for alerts to be indexed |
| `deleteAllAlerts()` | `alerts/delete_all_alerts.ts` | Clean up alerts |
| `deleteAllRules()` | `rules/delete_all_rules.ts` | Clean up detection rules |
| `createRule()` | `rules/create_rule.ts` | Create a detection rule |
| `waitForRuleStatus()` | `rules/wait_for_rule_status.ts` | Wait for rule to reach status |

### Entity Analytics Utilities

Located in `test_suites/entity_analytics/utils/`:

| Utility | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `EntityStoreUtils.cleanEngines()` | Delete all entity engines |
| `EntityStoreUtils.initEntityEngineForEntityTypesAndWait()` | Initialize and wait for engine to start |
| `EntityStoreUtils.waitForEngineStatus()` | Poll until engine reaches expected status |
| `EntityStoreUtils.expectEngineAssetsExist()` | Verify all engine assets are created |
| `elasticAssetCheckerFactory` | Utilities to check transforms, enrich policies, etc. |

| Utility | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `waitForSyncTaskRun()` | Wait for privilege monitoring sync task |
| `cleanPrivMonState()` | Clean all privilege monitoring state |
| `expectUsersToBePresent()` | Wait and verify users are synced |

### Common Wait Patterns

```typescript
// Using retry.waitForWithTimeout
const retry = getService('retry');

await retry.waitForWithTimeout(
  'Descriptive message for logs',
  60_000,  // Timeout in ms
  async () => {
    // Return true when condition is met
    // Return false to keep polling
    // Throw to fail immediately
    const { body } = await api.getStatus();
    return body.status === 'ready';
  }
);

// Using waitFor from detections-response
import { waitFor } from '@kbn/detections-response-ftr-services';

await waitFor(
  async () => {
    const response = await supertest.get('/api/endpoint').expect(200);
    return response.body.ready === true;
  },
  'waitForEndpoint',
  log,
  60_000  // Timeout
);
```

### Creating Custom Utilities

When you find yourself repeating the same wait pattern, create a utility:

```typescript
// In your test's utils file
export const EntityStoreUtils = (getService: FtrProviderContext['getService']) => {
  const retry = getService('retry');
  const log = getService('log');
  const entityAnalyticsApi = getService('entityAnalyticsApi');

  const waitForEngineStatus = async (entityType: string, expectedStatus: string) => {
    await retry.waitForWithTimeout(
      `Engine ${entityType} to reach ${expectedStatus}`,
      60_000,
      async () => {
        const { body } = await entityAnalyticsApi.getEntityEngine({ params: { entityType } });
        log.debug(`Engine ${entityType} status: ${body.status}`);
        
        if (body.status === 'error' && expectedStatus !== 'error') {
          throw new Error(`Engine failed: ${JSON.stringify(body)}`);
        }
        
        return body.status === expectedStatus;
      }
    );
  };

  return { waitForEngineStatus };
};
```

## Scout Migration Guidelines

When a test is:
- Not a duplicate
- Appropriately at the E2E layer
- Suffering from Cypress-specific flakiness

Consider recommending migration to Scout (Playwright-based).

### When to Suggest Scout Migration

✅ **Good candidates:**
- Tests with complex async flows
- Tests that would benefit from better page object patterns
- Tests with API setup/teardown needs
- New tests being written

❌ **Poor candidates:**
- Simple, stable tests
- Tests heavily dependent on Cypress-specific features
- Tests the team plans to delete soon

### Scout Migration Template

When suggesting migration, provide this structure:

```typescript
// Scout test structure
import { expect, tags, spaceTest } from '@kbn/scout-security';

spaceTest.describe('Feature Name', { tag: [...tags.stateful.classic, ...tags.serverless.security_complete] }, () => {
  spaceTest.beforeEach(async ({ browserAuth, apiServices }) => {
    // API-based setup (more reliable than UI setup)
    await apiServices.someService.setupData();
    await browserAuth.loginAsAdmin();
  });

  spaceTest.afterEach(async ({ apiServices }) => {
    // Cleanup via API
    await apiServices.someService.cleanupData();
  });

  spaceTest('test description', async ({ pageObjects }) => {
    const page = pageObjects.somePage;

    await spaceTest.step('Step 1: Navigate', async () => {
      await page.navigate();
    });

    await spaceTest.step('Step 2: Verify', async () => {
      await expect(page.someElement).toBeVisible();
    });
  });
});
```

**Key Scout advantages to highlight:**
- `apiServices` for reliable setup/teardown
- `pageObjects` for maintainable selectors
- `spaceTest.step()` for better debugging
- Built-in retry and wait mechanisms

## Common Flaky Patterns

<!--
PLACEHOLDER: Add known flaky patterns here
Format:
### Pattern Name
**Symptoms:** What the flaky failure looks like
**Root Cause:** Why it happens
**Fix:** How to resolve it
**Example:** Before/after code
-->

### Pattern: Missing API Wait
**Symptoms:** Element not found, assertion fails on data that should be there
**Root Cause:** Test asserts before API response is processed
**Fix:** Intercept and wait for the relevant API call

```typescript
// Before (flaky)
cy.visit('/page');
cy.get('[data-test-subj="data"]').should('contain', 'expected');

// After (stable)
cy.intercept('GET', '/api/data').as('getData');
cy.visit('/page');
cy.wait('@getData');
cy.get('[data-test-subj="data"]').should('contain', 'expected');
```

### Pattern: Hardcoded Waits
**Symptoms:** Test passes locally but fails in CI, or vice versa
**Root Cause:** `cy.wait(ms)` doesn't account for environment speed differences
**Fix:** Wait for specific conditions instead of time

```typescript
// Before (flaky)
cy.get('button').click();
cy.wait(2000);
cy.get('.result').should('be.visible');

// After (stable)
cy.get('button').click();
cy.get('.result', { timeout: 10000 }).should('be.visible');
```

### Pattern: Test Data Pollution
**Symptoms:** Test passes in isolation but fails when run with other tests
**Root Cause:** Test data from previous tests affects current test
**Fix:** Proper cleanup in beforeEach/afterEach, use unique identifiers

### Pattern: Forced Actions
**Symptoms:** Test passes but real UI bugs are hidden, or test works locally but fails in CI
**Root Cause:** Using `{ force: true }` bypasses visibility and actionability checks
**Fix:** Remove force flags; if impossible, add explanation comment and create a ticket

```typescript
// Before (hides bugs)
cy.get('[data-test-subj="button"]').click({ force: true });

// After (reveals real issues)
cy.get('[data-test-subj="button"]').should('be.visible').click();

// If force is truly necessary (temporary)
// TODO: Fix overlapping element - ticket: #12345
cy.get('[data-test-subj="button"]').click({ force: true });
```

**Note:** The same applies to adding extra `click()` before `type()`. The `type()` command clicks the input once before typing, so an extra `click()` usually indicates a problem.

### Pattern: Index-Based Element Selection
**Symptoms:** Test fails after UI changes even though the element still exists
**Root Cause:** Using `.eq(index)` to select elements makes tests brittle to order changes
**Fix:** Use unique `data-test-subj` attributes instead

```typescript
// Before (brittle)
cy.get('[data-test-subj="row"]').eq(2).click();

// After (stable)
cy.get('[data-test-subj="row-specific-id"]').click();
```

### Pattern: Input Field Value Not Entered
**Symptoms:** Test inputs a value but the field remains empty or has incorrect value
**Root Cause:** The input element is re-rendered after the test starts typing
**Diagnosis:**
1. Add a temporary hardcoded wait just before inputting the value
2. If the test passes, the element was likely re-rendered

```typescript
// Diagnostic step (temporary)
cy.wait(500); // If this fixes it, re-rendering is the issue
cy.get('[data-test-subj="input"]').type('value');
```

**Fix:** Check the React hooks in your application to ensure the input element is not re-rendered unexpectedly. Look for:
- `useEffect` dependencies causing re-renders
- State changes that unmount/remount the component
- Async data loading that resets form state

**Note:** This behavior can occur in both ESS and Serverless environments.

### Pattern: React useEffect Timing with Async Data
**Symptoms:**
- Filter or state not applied on first render
- UI shows stale/default values even when data is loaded
- Test worked before a feature flag change
- Element renders but with wrong configuration

**Root Cause:** React's `useEffect` runs AFTER render. When state depends on async data:
1. Component renders with default/stale state
2. Child components initialize with wrong values
3. `useEffect` updates state AFTER children have already rendered
4. Children may not re-query or may have cached the wrong state

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if a `useEffect` sets state based on async data (e.g., fetched rule, loaded config)
2. Check if child components render before the `useEffect` runs
3. Look for conditional rendering that doesn't gate on the async data being ready

```typescript
// Problematic pattern:
const rule = useRuleQuery(); // async
const isBuildingBlock = rule?.building_block_type != null;

useEffect(() => {
  setShowFilter(isBuildingBlock); // Runs AFTER render
}, [isBuildingBlock]);

// Child renders immediately with showFilter = false (default)
{ruleId && <AlertsTable filters={buildFilter(showFilter)} />}
```

**Fix:** Either gate child rendering on async data, OR compute derived state directly without waiting for useEffect:

```typescript
// Option 1: Gate rendering on data being ready
{ruleId && rule && <AlertsTable ... />}

// Option 2: Compute derived state directly (preferred)
const isBuildingBlock = rule?.building_block_type != null;
const shouldShowFilter = isBuildingBlock || showFilter; // Use directly
```

**Real Example:** Building block alerts test failed after `newDataViewPickerEnabled` feature flag was enabled. The new data view picker loaded faster, causing the alerts table to render before the `useEffect` could set the building block filter. Fix: Use `isBuildingBlockRule || showBuildingBlockAlerts` directly in the filter computation instead of waiting for the `useEffect`.

### Pattern: Feature Flag Changes Expose Race Conditions
**Symptoms:**
- Test was stable, then became flaky after a feature flag change
- No direct changes to the test or feature code
- Timing-related failures that seem unrelated to the flag
- Test comment says "fails after enabling [feature flag]"

**Root Cause:** Feature flags often change:
- Loading order of components
- When data becomes available
- Rendering timing and sequences
- Which code paths execute

A race condition may have always existed but was hidden because the old code path had different timing.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Identify what the feature flag changes (data fetching, rendering, initialization)
2. Compare timing between old and new code paths
3. Look for `useEffect` or state initialization that depends on render order
4. Check if the new path makes something load faster or slower

**Investigation approach:**
```bash
# Find what the feature flag affects
grep -r "featureFlagName" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"

# Check recent changes to affected components
git log --oneline -20 -- path/to/affected/component.tsx
```

**Fix:** The fix is usually in the application code, not the test. The test is correctly catching a race condition that was exposed by the timing change.

> ⚠️ **Important:** When a test fails after a feature flag change but the test code hasn't changed, the test may be catching a **real bug** in the application, not a flaky test. Don't skip the test—investigate the application code.

### Pattern: Stale Element Reference with `.within()`

**Symptoms:**
- Assertion fails to find an element that IS visible in the DOM
- Element exists when you `cy.pause()` and inspect manually
- Container has children, but `.within()` can't find them
- Debugging logs show the element is in a different location than expected

**Root Cause:** The `.within()` command captures a DOM element reference **once** and scopes all subsequent commands to that snapshot. If the parent element **re-renders** after `.within()` captures it (e.g., after an API call completes), the scoped commands look at the **stale/old** element, not the newly rendered one.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Add logging to check what's inside the container vs. where the element actually is:

```typescript
// Check container contents
cy.get('[data-test-subj="container"]').then($el => {
  cy.log('Container HTML:', $el.html());
});

// Check if element exists anywhere in DOM
cy.get('[data-test-subj="target-element"]').then($els => {
  cy.log('Found elements:', $els.length);
});
```

2. If the element exists in the DOM but not inside the container when logged, it's a stale reference issue.

**Fix:** Replace `.within()` with `.find()`:

```typescript
// ❌ Problematic: .within() holds stale reference after re-render
cy.get(CONTAINER).within(() => {
  cy.get(SELECTOR).should('be.visible');
});

// ✅ Fixed: .find() re-queries from parent on each retry
cy.get(CONTAINER).find(SELECTOR).should('be.visible');
```

**Why this works:**
- `.within()` captures the container element **once** at execution time
- `.find()` is **chained** from the parent query, so Cypress re-queries **both** parent and child on each retry attempt
- When the parent re-renders, `.find()` gets the fresh element; `.within()` still references the old one

**Real Example:** Alert assignments test (`assignments.cy.ts`) failed because after assigning a user via the flyout, the flyout header re-rendered. The `.within()` in `alertDetailsFlyoutShowsAssignees` held a reference to the old header element, so it couldn't find the newly added avatar. Fix: Changed to use `.find()` instead.

### Pattern: localStorage Persistence Race Condition

**Symptoms:**
- Test dismisses a UI element (callout, banner, modal) and reloads the page
- After reload, the dismissed element reappears
- Error: "Expected element not to exist in the DOM, but it was continuously found"
- Test passes if a hardcoded wait is added before reload (but this is an anti-pattern)

**Root Cause:** UI dismissals often persist state to `localStorage` asynchronously. If the test reloads the page before the persistence completes, the dismissed state is lost and the element reappears.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if the dismissed element's state is stored in `localStorage`
2. Look for React hooks like `useMessagesStorage` or similar that handle persistence
3. Add `cy.pause()` before the reload to see if the dismissal works when given time

**Fix:** Wait for the `localStorage` value to be updated before performing actions that depend on it:

```typescript
// ❌ Flaky: Reloads before localStorage is updated
cy.get(DISMISS_BUTTON).click();
cy.get(CALLOUT).should('not.exist');
cy.reload();  // localStorage may not be persisted yet!
cy.get(CALLOUT).should('not.exist');  // Fails - callout reappears

// ✅ Fixed: Wait for localStorage persistence
cy.get(DISMISS_BUTTON).click();
cy.get(CALLOUT).should('not.exist');

// Wait for localStorage to be updated
const storageKey = 'kibana.securitySolution.detections.callouts.dismissed-messages';
cy.window()
  .then((win) => {
    const dismissed: string[] = JSON.parse(win.localStorage.getItem(storageKey) || '[]');
    return dismissed.some((id) => id.startsWith('expected-callout-id'));
  })
  .should('be.true');

cy.reload();
cy.get(CALLOUT).should('not.exist');  // Now works!
```

**Key details:**
- The `useMessagesStorage` hook appends `-messages` to the storage key (e.g., `callouts.dismissed` becomes `callouts.dismissed-messages`)
- Some IDs include hash suffixes, so use prefix matching with `.startsWith()` instead of exact matching
- This pattern applies to any UI state persisted to localStorage (preferences, dismissed banners, column settings, etc.)

**Real Example:** The `missing_privileges_callout.cy.ts` test was dismissing a callout and reloading the page, but the callout reappeared because localStorage persistence hadn't completed. Fix: Wait for the dismissed ID to appear in localStorage before reloading.

### Pattern: Visualization Elements Require Data

**Symptoms:**
- Test fails trying to interact with chart legends, treemap cells, or histogram bars
- Error: "Expected to find element... but never found it"
- Element exists when data is present but test runs before data loads
- Works locally (slower, more time for data) but fails in CI (faster)

**Root Cause:** Visualization components (histograms, treemaps, donut charts) only render interactive elements like legends when there's actual data to display. If the test tries to interact with these elements before data is loaded/indexed, they don't exist yet.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if the test waits for data to be available
2. Look at screenshots - is the chart empty?
3. Add `cy.pause()` before the interaction to see if data eventually appears

**Fix:** Wait for data to populate before interacting with visualization elements:

```typescript
// ❌ Flaky: Chart has no data yet, legend doesn't exist
beforeEach(() => {
  createRule(getNewRule());
  visitWithTimeRange(ALERTS_URL);
  // No wait for alerts!
});

it('interacts with histogram legend', () => {
  selectAlertsHistogram();
  clickAlertsHistogramLegend();  // Fails - no legend without data!
});

// ✅ Fixed: Wait for alerts to populate first
beforeEach(() => {
  createRule(getNewRule());
  visitWithTimeRange(ALERTS_URL);
  waitForAlertsToPopulate();  // Ensures data exists
});

it('interacts with histogram legend', () => {
  selectAlertsHistogram();
  clickAlertsHistogramLegend();  // Works - legend exists now
});
```

**Real Example:** The `alerts_charts.cy.ts` test was creating a rule and immediately trying to interact with the histogram legend. The legend only appears when alerts exist in the chart, but alerts hadn't been generated/indexed yet. Fix: Added `waitForAlertsToPopulate()` in `beforeEach`.

### Pattern: API Timeout in CI

**Symptoms:**
- Test times out waiting for an API response
- Works locally but fails in CI
- Error mentions `cy.request() timed out waiting Xms for a response`
- Often happens with slow operations (package installation, bulk operations)

**Root Cause:** CI environments may have:
- Different default timeouts than local (e.g., 30s vs 60s)
- Slower infrastructure
- More concurrent load affecting response times

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check the `responseTimeout` in `cypress.config.ts` vs `cypress_ci.config.ts`
2. Identify if the API call is inherently slow (e.g., installing packages, bulk operations)
3. Check if it's a one-time failure vs consistent

**Fix Options:**

1. **Increase timeout for specific slow calls:**
```typescript
// For specific slow API calls
cy.request({
  method: 'POST',
  url: '/api/fleet/epm/packages',
  timeout: 120000,  // 2 minutes for slow package installation
  body: packageData,
});
```

2. **Check CI config timeouts:**
```typescript
// In cypress_ci.config.ts
responseTimeout: 60000,  // Ensure adequate timeout for CI
```

**Real Example:** The `bulk_edit_rules_actions.cy.ts` test timed out on Fleet API package installation in ESS CI but passed locally and in Serverless. The CI had a 30s timeout while the operation needed more time.

### Pattern: Visual/Overlap Tests

**Symptoms:**
- Test checks if elements visually overlap or are positioned correctly
- Uses manual coordinate calculations or `getBoundingClientRect()`
- Highly sensitive to CSS changes, viewport size, or rendering timing
- Fails intermittently with no clear pattern

**Root Cause:** Visual positioning tests are inherently fragile because:
- Browser rendering timing varies
- CSS animations may not complete
- Viewport/zoom differences between environments
- Minor CSS changes can break positioning assertions

**Diagnosis:**
1. Is this test checking something that affects functionality, or purely visual?
2. Can this be tested more reliably at a different level?
3. Is the visual requirement critical to user experience?

**Recommendation:**

```typescript
// ❌ Fragile: Manual overlap detection
cy.get(TOOLTIP_A).then(($a) => {
  cy.get(TOOLTIP_B).then(($b) => {
    const rectA = $a[0].getBoundingClientRect();
    const rectB = $b[0].getBoundingClientRect();
    expect(elementsOverlap(rectA, rectB)).to.be.false;  // Flaky!
  });
});

// ✅ Better: Test functionality, not pixel positions
// Or delete if purely cosmetic and already covered by visual regression tools
```

**When to delete visual tests:**
- The visual aspect is cosmetic, not functional
- Visual regression testing tools (Percy, Chromatic) already cover it
- The test has been skipped for months with no resolution
- Fixing would require significant effort for minimal value

**Real Example:** The `row_renderers.cy.ts` tooltip overlap test was checking that two tooltips don't visually overlap. This is fragile and better suited for visual regression testing or manual QA.

## API Test Flaky Patterns

> 🚧 **Work in Progress:** The following patterns are based on initial observations from API test flakiness. This section is actively being expanded as more patterns are discovered. If you find a new pattern, please add it here.

The following patterns are specific to FTR-based API integration tests.

### API Pattern: Async Engine/Resource Initialization

**Symptoms:**
- Test fails because engine, transform, or resource returns unexpected status
- Error: `expected 'installing' to equal 'started'`
- Test passes on retry or when run in isolation
- Timing-sensitive assertions on resource status

**Root Cause:** Elasticsearch operations (transforms, enrich policies, indices, entity engines) are asynchronous. The API may return before the operation completes.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if the test waits for the resource to reach expected status
2. Look for `await api.initSomething()` followed immediately by `await api.getSomething()`
3. Check if utility functions include polling logic

```typescript
// ❌ Flaky - doesn't wait for engine to be ready
await entityAnalyticsApi.initEntityEngine({ params: { entityType: 'host' } });
const { body } = await entityAnalyticsApi.getEntityEngine({ params: { entityType: 'host' } });
expect(body.status).to.eql('started'); // May still be 'installing'!

// ✅ Stable - uses retry with timeout
await entityAnalyticsApi.initEntityEngine({ params: { entityType: 'host' } });
await retry.waitForWithTimeout(
  'Engine to start',
  60_000,
  async () => {
    const { body } = await entityAnalyticsApi.getEntityEngine({ params: { entityType } });
    return body.status === 'started';
  }
);
```

**Real Example:** Entity Store API tests (`entity_store.ts`) failed intermittently because engines were checked immediately after initialization. Fix: Created `initEntityEngineForEntityTypesAndWait()` utility that polls until status is 'started'.

### API Pattern: Transform/Index Not Ready

**Symptoms:**
- Error: `transform not found`, `index not found`, `resource_not_found_exception`
- Test creates a resource then immediately queries it
- Works locally (slower) but fails in CI (faster)
- Elasticsearch returns stale or missing data

**Root Cause:** Elasticsearch resources (transforms, indices, enrich policies) take time to propagate across the cluster. The resource may not be queryable immediately after creation.

```typescript
// ❌ Flaky - transform may not exist yet
await es.transform.putTransform({ transform_id: id, body: config });
const { body } = await es.transform.getTransform({ transform_id: id }); // May throw!

// ✅ Stable - retry with delay
const expectTransformExists = async (
  transformId: string,
  attempts: number = 5,
  delayMs: number = 2000
) => {
  let currentAttempt = 1;
  while (currentAttempt <= attempts) {
    try {
      await es.transform.getTransform({ transform_id: transformId });
      return; // Success
    } catch (e) {
      if (currentAttempt === attempts) throw e;
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delayMs));
      currentAttempt++;
    }
  }
};
```

**Real Example:** Entity Store tests checking for transform existence immediately after engine initialization. Fix: Added polling utilities like `expectTransformExists()` with configurable retry attempts.

### API Pattern: Background Task Timing

**Symptoms:**
- Test expects data that should be created by a background task
- Data is missing or stale
- Error: assertion on empty array or missing records
- Works when a delay is added (but hardcoded delays are bad)

**Root Cause:** Kibana task manager tasks run on intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes). If a test depends on a task having run, it may fail if the task hasn't executed yet.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if the feature uses background tasks (look for `TaskManager`, scheduled tasks)
2. Identify the task interval
3. Check if there's a way to trigger the task or wait for it

```typescript
// ❌ Flaky - task may not have run yet
await privMonApi.enablePrivMonEngine();
const { body } = await privMonApi.getUsers();
expect(body.users.length).to.be.greaterThan(0); // Empty - task hasn't synced!

// ✅ Stable - wait for task execution
await privMonApi.enablePrivMonEngine();
await waitForSyncTaskRun(); // Wait for background task
const { body } = await privMonApi.getUsers();
expect(body.users.length).to.be.greaterThan(0); // Has data
```

**Real Example:** Privilege monitoring tests (`cross_source_sync.ts`) failed because they expected synced users immediately after enabling the engine. Fix: Added `waitForSyncTaskRun()` utility that waits for the task to execute.

### API Pattern: Incomplete Cleanup Between Tests

**Symptoms:**
- Test passes in isolation but fails when run with suite
- Test fails with "already exists" or duplicate resource errors
- Unexpected data appears in test results
- Order-dependent failures (test A passes, test B fails, but B passes when run alone)

**Root Cause:** Resources created by previous tests (or previous failed runs) interfere with the current test.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check `before`/`after` hooks for cleanup
2. Look for resources that persist across tests
3. Check if cleanup runs even when tests fail

```typescript
// ❌ Flaky - leftover engines from previous runs
before(async () => {
  await utils.initEntityEngineForEntityTypesAndWait(['host']);
});

after(async () => {
  await utils.cleanEngines();
});

// ✅ Stable - clean before AND after
before(async () => {
  await utils.cleanEngines(); // Clean first to handle crashed previous runs
  await utils.initEntityEngineForEntityTypesAndWait(['host']);
});

after(async () => {
  await utils.cleanEngines();
});

// Even better - clean in beforeEach for test isolation
beforeEach(async () => {
  await utils.cleanEngines();
});

afterEach(async () => {
  await utils.cleanEngines();
});
```

**Real Example:** Entity Store tests failed when run together because engines from previous tests weren't cleaned. Fix: Added `cleanEngines()` to both `before` and `after` hooks.

### API Pattern: Asserting on Async Aggregations

**Symptoms:**
- Aggregation counts don't match expected values
- Data exists but aggregation returns 0 or partial count
- Works with a delay, fails without
- Elasticsearch query returns stale results

**Root Cause:** Elasticsearch indices may not be refreshed immediately after writes. Aggregations may return stale data.

```typescript
// ❌ Flaky - index may not be refreshed
await es.index({ index: 'my-index', document: data });
const { body } = await es.search({
  index: 'my-index',
  body: { aggs: { count: { value_count: { field: 'id' } } } }
});
expect(body.aggregations.count.value).to.eql(1); // May be 0!

// ✅ Stable - force refresh or use retry
await es.index({ index: 'my-index', document: data, refresh: true }); // Force refresh

// Or use retry
await retry.waitForWithTimeout('Document to be indexed', 10000, async () => {
  const { body } = await es.search({ index: 'my-index', body: { query: { match_all: {} } } });
  return body.hits.total.value === 1;
});
```

### API Pattern: Race Condition in Engine State

**Symptoms:**
- Engine status fluctuates between states
- Test catches engine in intermediate state
- Error assertions on status like 'error' when expecting 'started'
- Multiple concurrent operations interfere with each other

**Root Cause:** When multiple engines or operations are initialized concurrently, race conditions can cause unexpected states.

```typescript
// ❌ Potentially flaky - concurrent operations may interfere
await Promise.all([
  entityAnalyticsApi.initEntityEngine({ params: { entityType: 'host' } }),
  entityAnalyticsApi.initEntityEngine({ params: { entityType: 'user' } }),
]);
// Check status immediately - may catch intermediate state

// ✅ Stable - wait for all to reach expected state
await Promise.all([
  entityAnalyticsApi.initEntityEngine({ params: { entityType: 'host' } }),
  entityAnalyticsApi.initEntityEngine({ params: { entityType: 'user' } }),
]);

await Promise.all([
  utils.waitForEngineStatus('host', 'started'),
  utils.waitForEngineStatus('user', 'started'),
]);
```

### API Pattern: Invalid API Key from Role Reuse

**Symptoms:**
- 401 Unauthorized errors in Serverless tests
- Test passes on first run but fails on subsequent runs
- Works in ESS but fails in Serverless
- API calls fail with "invalid API key" errors

**Root Cause:** The `securitySolutionUtils.createSuperTest()` helper keeps track of only one active session per role. If you create multiple `supertest` instances for the same role, the first instance's API key becomes invalid.

```typescript
// ❌ Flaky - first instance becomes invalid
const supertest1 = await utils.createSuperTest('admin');
const supertest2 = await utils.createSuperTest('admin'); // Invalidates supertest1!

await supertest1.get('/api/endpoint').expect(200); // 401 Unauthorized!

// ✅ Stable - reuse the same instance
let adminSupertest: TestAgent;

before(async () => {
  adminSupertest = await utils.createSuperTest('admin');
});

it('test 1', async () => {
  await adminSupertest.get('/api/endpoint').expect(200);
});

it('test 2', async () => {
  await adminSupertest.get('/api/other').expect(200); // Uses same instance
});

// ✅ Stable - different roles are fine
before(async () => {
  adminSupertest = await utils.createSuperTest('admin');
  viewerSupertest = await utils.createSuperTest('viewer'); // Different role, OK
});
```

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if the test creates multiple `supertest` instances for the same role
2. Look for `createSuperTest()` calls in `beforeEach` (should usually be in `before`)
3. Check if `supertest` is being created inside individual tests

## Test Deletion Guidelines

When a test is more trouble than it's worth, consider deletion. Use this process:

### When to Delete vs Fix

**Delete the test if:**
- ✅ Full duplicate coverage exists at API and/or unit test levels
- ✅ The test has been skipped for 3+ months with no progress
- ✅ The test validates purely cosmetic/visual behavior
- ✅ The effort to fix exceeds the value the test provides
- ✅ The functionality is deprecated or being removed

**Fix the test if:**
- ❌ It tests unique E2E user flows not covered elsewhere
- ❌ It catches real bugs that other tests miss
- ❌ The fix is straightforward (missing wait, wrong selector, etc.)
- ❌ It's a critical user journey

### Deletion Process

1. **Verify duplicate coverage:**
   - Search for API integration tests covering the same functionality
   - Search for unit tests covering the component behavior
   - Document the exact files and test names that provide coverage

2. **Delete the test file**

3. **Clean up orphaned code** (see checklist below)

4. **Update related documentation** if any

### Orphaned Code Cleanup Checklist

When deleting a test, also remove code that was ONLY used by that test:

```
□ Check tasks/ files imported by the test
  └─ If task file is only used by deleted test → delete it

□ Check screens/ files imported by tasks
  └─ If screen file is only used by deleted tasks → delete it

□ Check objects/ files imported by the test
  └─ If object is only used by deleted test → delete it

□ Check shared files for orphaned exports
  └─ If a function in a shared file is only used by deleted code → remove it

□ Run grep to verify no other usages exist before deleting
```

**Example cleanup from `connectors.cy.ts` deletion:**
- Deleted: `cypress/e2e/explore/cases/connectors.cy.ts`
- Deleted: `cypress/tasks/configure_cases.ts` (only used by that test)
- Deleted: `cypress/screens/configure_cases.ts` (only used by that tasks file)
- Modified: `cypress/tasks/all_cases.ts` (removed orphaned `goToEditExternalConnection` function)
- Modified: `cypress/screens/all_cases.ts` (removed orphaned `EDIT_EXTERNAL_CONNECTION` selector)

---

## Environment-Specific Considerations

### General Guidance

- **ESS:** Full feature set, traditional deployment
- **Serverless:** Stateless, may have different feature flags enabled
- **MKI:** Kubernetes-based, different auth, performance characteristics, and API restrictions

When a test is flaky in only one environment, investigate:
1. Feature flag differences
2. Timing/performance differences
3. Authentication flow differences
4. Data availability differences

---

### MKI-Specific Issues

#### Issue: 403 Forbidden on API Calls

**Symptoms:**
- Error happens only on MKI environments
- Tests pass on CI and non-MKI environments
- The failing method is hitting an internal index

**Root Cause:** Direct access to internal indices is restricted in MKI.

**Fix:** Use an API to perform actions on indices instead of direct index access.

```typescript
// ❌ Direct index access (fails on MKI)
cy.request('PUT', '/.internal-index/_doc/1', data);

// ✅ Use application API
cy.request('POST', '/api/security/some-endpoint', data);
```

---

#### Issue: "Log in to your account" Page Displayed

**Symptoms:**
- Error happens only on MKI environments
- Tests pass on CI and non-MKI environments
- Tests take unusually long to execute
- At some point the session is logged off

**Root Cause:** Performance issues in the application cause session timeout.

**Fix:** This is a performance issue in the application itself. Investigate and optimize:
- Reduce unnecessary API calls
- Optimize component rendering
- Check for memory leaks or infinite loops

---

#### Issue: Username Assertions Failing

**Symptoms:**
- Error happens only on MKI environments
- Tests pass on CI and non-MKI environments
- Username is hardcoded as `system_indices_superuser`

**Root Cause:** `system_indices_superuser` does not exist in MKI environments.

**Fix:** Use `getDefaultUsername()` instead of hardcoding:

```typescript
// ❌ Hardcoded (fails on MKI)
cy.contains('system_indices_superuser');

// ✅ Dynamic username
import { getDefaultUsername } from '../tasks/common/users';

cy.contains(getDefaultUsername());
```

**Reference:** `x-pack/solutions/security/test/security_solution_cypress/cypress/tasks/common/users.ts`

---

#### Issue: Functionality Missing Due to Feature Flag

**Symptoms:**
- Error happens only on MKI environments
- Tests pass on CI and non-MKI environments
- Test fails because a feature is missing
- The feature requires a feature flag to be enabled

**Root Cause:** Currently there is no easy way to enable/disable feature flags in MKI environments.

**Fix:** Skip the test on MKI serverless environments:

```typescript
// Cypress: Add the skip tag to tests requiring feature flags
describe('Feature requiring FF', { tags: ['@skipInServerlessMKI'] }, () => {
  it('should do something', () => {
    // test code
  });
});

// API tests: Add skip tag in describe block
describe('@ess @serverless @skipInServerlessMKI Feature requiring FF', () => {
  it('should do something', async () => {
    // test code
  });
});
```

**Note:** Per product requirements, the Kibana team has been asked to implement a feature flag mechanism before Serverless GA.

> ⚠️ **Important for API Tests:** The `./scripts/api_configs.json` file allows configuring PLIs (Product Line Items like Essentials vs Complete tier) for MKI, but **experimental feature flags are NOT yet supported**. If your test requires a feature flag, it must be skipped in MKI until this is implemented.

---

#### Issue: Infrastructure Not Ready

**Symptoms:**
- Elements are disabled when they should be enabled
- API calls fail with "shards not active" or "index not found"
- Test fails only on MKI, passes on ESS/local
- Timing-sensitive failures early in test execution
- Server logs show warnings about cluster/node state

**Root Cause:** MKI infrastructure (indices, shards, ML nodes) may not be fully ready when test starts. This is especially common for:
- ML jobs requiring datafeed nodes
- Tests that load data via `esArchiver`
- Tests that create indices and immediately query them

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check server logs for infrastructure warnings
2. Look for "primary shards not active", "no node found", "index not ready"
3. Check if test setup waits for infrastructure readiness
4. Look for caching that might hide the "not ready" state

**Example from server logs:**
```
[v3_linux_anomalous_network_activity] No node found to start datafeed
[datafeed-v3_linux_anomalous_network_activity]. Reasons [cannot start datafeed
because index [auditbeat-2022] does not have all primary shards active yet.]
```

**Fix Options:**
1. **Add infrastructure readiness checks** to test setup (wait for shards, wait for ML nodes)
2. **Report as environment issue** if it's a deployment/infrastructure problem
3. **Add appropriate waits** for indices/shards to be active before proceeding
4. **Skip on MKI** with `@skipInServerlessMKI` if infrastructure requirements can't be reliably met

**Real Example:** ML rule suppression test failed because `forceStartDatafeeds()` returned before jobs started. The UI cached "not started" status (5-minute cache), keeping fields disabled. Server logs revealed shards weren't active yet - an infrastructure issue, not a test bug.

---

### API Tests: MKI-Specific Considerations

API tests have additional considerations when running in MKI environments:

#### Issue: Transform Operations Take Longer

**Symptoms:**
- Tests timeout waiting for transforms to start
- Works in ESS but fails in MKI
- Transform status remains 'installing' longer than expected

**Root Cause:** MKI infrastructure may have different performance characteristics. Transforms and ES operations can take longer.

**Fix:** Increase timeout values for MKI:

```typescript
const TIMEOUT = process.env.IS_MKI ? 120_000 : 60_000;

await retry.waitForWithTimeout(
  'Transform to be ready',
  TIMEOUT,
  async () => {
    // ... check transform status
  }
);
```

#### Issue: Index Refresh Timing

**Symptoms:**
- Documents written but not immediately visible
- Aggregations return 0 or stale counts
- Works locally, fails in MKI

**Root Cause:** Index refresh in MKI may have different timing due to cluster configuration.

**Fix:** Use explicit refresh or longer retry timeouts:

```typescript
// Option 1: Force refresh after write
await es.index({ index: 'my-index', document: data, refresh: true });

// Option 2: Use retry with longer timeout
await retry.waitForWithTimeout('Document to be indexed', 30_000, async () => {
  const { body } = await es.search({ index: 'my-index' });
  return body.hits.total.value > 0;
});
```

#### Issue: Internal Index Access Restrictions

**Symptoms:**
- 403 Forbidden when accessing `.internal-*` or `.kibana*` indices directly
- Works in ESS, fails in MKI
- Test uses direct ES operations on internal indices

**Root Cause:** MKI restricts direct access to internal indices for security.

**Fix:** Use Kibana APIs instead of direct ES operations:

```typescript
// ❌ Direct ES access (fails in MKI)
await es.index({ index: '.internal-my-index', document: data });

// ✅ Use Kibana API
await supertest
  .post('/api/my-feature/data')
  .send(data)
  .expect(200);
```

#### Issue: Task Scheduling Differences

**Symptoms:**
- Background tasks don't run as expected
- Task intervals seem different
- Data synced by tasks is missing or delayed

**Root Cause:** Task Manager behavior may differ in MKI due to cluster configuration.

**Fix:** Add explicit waits for task execution and consider longer intervals:

```typescript
// Wait for task to run with longer timeout in MKI
await waitFor(
  async () => {
    const users = await privMonApi.getUsers();
    return users.body.length > 0;
  },
  'waitForTaskSync',
  log,
  180_000 // 3 minutes for MKI
);
```

## Running MKI Tests Locally

When debugging MKI-specific flakiness, you can run tests against a real MKI environment locally.

### Cypress: MKI Local Execution

#### Setup Required

1. **Create Elastic Cloud API key for QA:**
   - Navigate to [QA Console](https://console.qa.cld.elstc.co)
   - Click User menu → Organization → API keys → Create API key
   - Set name, expiration, assign organization owner role
   - Save the key to `~/.elastic/cloud.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "api_key": {
       "qa": "<API_KEY>"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Configure role users** at `.ftr/role_users.json` (Kibana root):

   ```json
   {
     "platform_engineer": {
       "email": "<email>",
       "password": "<password>"
     },
     "admin": {
       "email": "<email>",
       "password": "<password>"
     }
   }
   ```

   > ⚠️ **Important:** Append `+skip-mfa` to email addresses to bypass MFA (e.g., `user+platform_engineer+skip-mfa@elasticsearch.com`)

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Navigate to Cypress directory
cd x-pack/solutions/security/test/security_solution_cypress

# Set environment
export QA_CONSOLE_URL="https://console.qa.cld.elstc.co"

# Open Cypress with MKI project (auto-created and auto-deleted)
yarn cypress:open:qa:serverless

# Debug failures from periodic pipeline (use specific commit)
yarn cypress:open:qa:serverless --commit <GithubCommitHashValue>
```

**Finding the commit hash from periodic pipeline:**
1. Go to #security-serverless-test-alerts Slack channel
2. Click "View Step" for the failing execution
3. Expand the failing execution in Buildkite
4. Copy the `Github Commit Hash` from the blue box

#### PLI Configuration Options

```bash
# Run with Essentials tier (default is Complete)
yarn cypress:open:qa:serverless --tier essentials

# Run without endpoint add-on
yarn cypress:open:qa:serverless --no-endpoint-addon

# Run without cloud add-on
yarn cypress:open:qa:serverless --no-cloud-addon

# Combine flags
yarn cypress:open:qa:serverless --commit <hash> --tier essentials --no-endpoint-addon
```

#### Available Roles for Testing

Configure in `.ftr/role_users.json`:
- `admin`
- `platform_engineer` (default for tests)
- `detections_admin`
- `editor`
- `endpoint_operations_analyst`
- `endpoint_policy_manager`
- `rule_author`
- `soc_manager`
- `t1_analyst`, `t2_analyst`, `t3_analyst`
- `threat_intelligence_analyst`
- `viewer`
- `none`

### API Tests: MKI Local Execution

#### Setup Required

Install the QAF (QA Framework) tool on your machine.

#### Create and Run Tests

```bash
# 1. Create a Serverless project
qaf elastic-cloud projects create \
  --project-type security \
  --project-name <projectName> \
  --environment qa \
  --region aws-eu-west-1

# 2. Get credentials
qaf elastic-cloud projects list --show-credentials

# 3. Run tests against MKI
TEST_CLOUD=1 \
TEST_ES_URL="https://<user>:<password>@<elasticsearchUrl>" \
TEST_KIBANA_URL="https://<user>:<password>@<kibanaUrl>" \
yarn <apiTestScript>

# 4. Clean up after testing
qaf elastic-cloud projects delete-all
```

> ⚠️ **Notes for API MKI testing:**
> - For specific PLIs, manually configure them in the created project
> - For different authorization roles, manually configure in the project

---

## Team Conventions

### Spec File Execution Time

⏱️ **A spec file should not take more than 10 minutes to execute.**

**Why this matters:**
- Shorter tests make it easier to diagnose issues when failures happen
- Longer tests are more prone to breakage due to application or environment changes
- Waiting too long for test results impacts developer productivity
- Long tests increase the blast radius of flakiness

**If a spec exceeds 10 minutes:**
1. Split into multiple focused spec files
2. Consider if some tests can move to API/unit layer
3. Optimize setup/teardown to reduce redundant operations

### File Organization

**Screens folder:** Extract all element selectors to `cypress/screens/`
```typescript
// cypress/screens/alerts.ts
export const ALERTS_TABLE = '[data-test-subj="alerts-table"]';
export const ALERT_ROW = '[data-test-subj="alert-row"]';
```
- When locators change, update in one place
- Improves consistency across tests

**Tasks folder:** Extract user actions to `cypress/tasks/`
```typescript
// cypress/tasks/alerts.ts
export const openAlertDetails = (alertId: string) => {
  cy.get(ALERT_ROW).contains(alertId).click();
  cy.get(ALERT_DETAILS_FLYOUT).should('be.visible');
};
```
- Makes tests read like user stories
- When user flows change, update in one place

### Selector Best Practices

Always use `data-test-subj` attributes:
```typescript
// ✅ Good - unique and stable
cy.get('[data-test-subj="myButton"]');

// ❌ Avoid - classes change for styling
cy.get('.my-button');

// ❌ Avoid - IDs may not be unique
cy.get('#my-button');

// ❌ Avoid - brittle to order changes
cy.get('[data-test-subj="row"]').eq(2);
```

**Why `data-test-subj`:**
- Must be unique within the document (no ambiguity)
- Classes are for styling and change frequently
- Dedicated to testing, won't be removed by refactoring

**Real Example:** [#246754](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/246754) - Test deleted because it used CSS class selector `.controlFrame__labelToolTip` which became unreliable after a refactor. Coverage was moved to a more appropriate testing layer.

### Data Setup

**Minimize `es_archive` usage.** When possible, create test data using:
1. Application APIs (preferred)
2. UI interactions (if testing the creation flow)

```typescript
// ✅ Preferred - API-based setup
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.request('POST', '/api/detection_engine/rules', rulePayload);
});

// ❌ Avoid when possible
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.task('esArchiver:load', 'path/to/archive');
});
```

### Hardcoded Waits

🚫 **Hardcoded waits are forbidden.**

They introduce unnecessary delays and lead to flakiness. Wait for specific conditions:

```typescript
// ❌ Forbidden
cy.wait(2000);

// ✅ Wait for API response
cy.wait('@apiCall');

// ✅ Wait for element state
cy.get('[data-test-subj="table"]').should('be.visible');

// ✅ Wait for text to appear
cy.contains('Success').should('exist');
```

### Prefer `be.visible` Over `exist` for User-Facing Elements

For elements that users should actually see, use `.should('be.visible')` instead of `.should('exist')`:

```typescript
// ❌ Less reliable - only checks DOM presence
cy.get('[data-test-subj="avatar"]').should('exist');

// ✅ Better - verifies the user can actually see the element
cy.get('[data-test-subj="avatar"]').should('be.visible');
```

**When to use each:**

| Assertion | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| `.should('be.visible')` | User-facing elements (buttons, avatars, text, modals) |
| `.should('exist')` | Elements that may be hidden (e.g., checking DOM structure, hidden inputs) |
| `.should('not.exist')` | Confirming element is removed from DOM |
| `.should('not.be.visible')` | Confirming element is hidden but still in DOM |

**Why `be.visible` is better for most cases:**
- Catches elements hidden by CSS (`display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, `opacity: 0`)
- Verifies element has dimensions (width/height > 0)
- Confirms element is not covered by other elements
- Aligns with actual user experience

### Pattern: Environment-Specific Selector Differences

**Symptoms:**
- Test passes in ESS but fails in Serverless (or vice versa)
- Element exists in DOM but selector doesn't match
- Attribute values differ between environments

**Root Cause:** UI element attributes can have different values in ESS vs Serverless. Common differences:
- User display names may include email in Serverless
- Feature flags may change element structure
- Different data formats between environments

**Example:** Avatar `title` attribute differs:
| Environment | `title` attribute value |
|-------------|------------------------|
| ESS | `title="system_indices_superuser"` |
| Serverless | `title="test platform_engineer (elastic_platform_engineer@elastic.co)"` |

**Fix:** Use partial attribute selectors instead of exact matches:

```typescript
// ❌ Exact match - works in ESS, fails in Serverless
`[title='${username}']`

// ✅ Partial match (starts-with) - works in both environments
`[title^='${username}']`

// ✅ Partial match (contains) - alternative approach
`[title*='${username}']`
```

**CSS Attribute Selector Reference:**
| Selector | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `[attr='value']` | Exact match |
| `[attr^='value']` | Starts with |
| `[attr$='value']` | Ends with |
| `[attr*='value']` | Contains |

**Real Example:** The `assignments.cy.ts` test passed in ESS but failed in Serverless because avatar titles in Serverless include the user's email. Fix: Changed selector from `[title='${username}']` to `[title^='${username}']` to match the beginning of the title regardless of email suffix.

### Before Opening a PR

✅ **Make sure your test fails.**

Before submitting a new test:
1. Temporarily break the assertion or feature
2. Verify the test actually fails
3. Restore the correct state

If you never see your test fail, you don't know if it's testing the right thing—or anything at all.

---

## Flaky Test Runner

The **Flaky Test Runner** is a Kibana tool that runs specific tests many times to help verify a fix works.

### How to Use It

1. Go to https://ci-stats.kibana.dev/trigger_flaky_test_runner
2. Follow the wizard to:
   - Pick a PR (or branch)
   - Select which test(s) to run
   - Use the default number of executions
3. Start the job at Buildkite
4. View progress and results in Buildkite

### Always Verify Your Fix

> ✅ **After fixing a flaky test, always run the Flaky Test Runner to verify the fix works.**

This helps ensure:
- The fix actually addresses the root cause
- The test doesn't fail intermittently anymore
- You have evidence the fix works before merging

### Specifying the Test File

When using the Flaky Test Runner via the [CI Stats website](https://ci-stats.kibana.dev/trigger_flaky_test_runner), you can specify the exact test file path to run. This ensures only the relevant test is executed multiple times.

**Example test path:**
```
x-pack/solutions/security/test/security_solution_cypress/cypress/e2e/investigations/alerts/building_block_alerts.cy.ts
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** The Flaky Test Runner runs in CI, not locally. Always use the CI Stats website to trigger test runs - this ensures the test runs in the same environment where flakiness was observed.

### Flaky Test Process

1. **Test starts failing in CI** → GitHub issue is created automatically
2. **Operations team evaluates** → If flaky enough (4+ failures/week for FTR tests), test is skipped
3. **Issue gets labels:** `blocker`, `skipped test`, and version label
4. **Owning team investigates** → Analyze failures, find root cause
5. **Fix is implemented** → Use Flaky Test Runner to verify
6. **Test is unskipped** → Monitor for continued stability

### Viewing Flaky Test History

Use the [Kibana CI Dashboard](https://ops.kibana.dev/s/ci/app/dashboards#/view/cb7380fb-67fe-5c41-873d-003d1a407dad) to:
- See all failures in Kibana CI
- Identify patterns of failures
- Determine if failures are flakiness vs. PR-specific issues

### Tags for Skipping Tests

When a test needs to be skipped, use the appropriate tags:

```typescript
// Skip in ESS environments
describe('My test', { tags: ['@serverless', '@skipInEss'] }, () => { ... });

// Skip in all Serverless environments
describe('My test', { tags: ['@ess', '@skipInServerless'] }, () => { ... });

// Skip only in Serverless MKI (real cloud)
describe('My test', { tags: ['@ess', '@serverless', '@skipInServerlessMKI'] }, () => { ... });
```

**Always include a comment with the GitHub issue link when skipping a test:**
```typescript
// Skip due to flakiness: https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/XXXXX
describe.skip('My flaky test', ...);
```

**Classification:** [Bug / Flakiness]
**Confidence:** [High / Medium / Low]

## 📋 Findings

### Duplicate Coverage
[Found / Not Found - details]

### Layer Analysis
[Appropriate / Should Move - details]

### Root Cause
[What's causing the failure]

## 💡 Recommendation

## Continuous Learning

**Be proactive about new patterns.** When you identify a root cause or fix that is NOT already documented in this rule, immediately tell the user:

> "I noticed this fix involves a pattern that's not yet documented in the flaky-test-doctor rule: **[brief description of pattern]**. Would you like me to add it so future fixes can benefit from this learning?"

If the user agrees, add the pattern to the "Common Flaky Patterns" section following the established format.

**Signs you've discovered something new:**
- The root cause doesn't match any existing pattern in this rule
- You had to investigate a unique combination of factors
- The fix required a technique not mentioned in this rule
- Environment-specific behavior that wasn't documented
