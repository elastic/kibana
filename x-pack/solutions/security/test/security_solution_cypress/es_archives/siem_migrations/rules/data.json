The original SPL query:\n```splunk-spl\nsource=\"tutorialdata.zip:*\"\n| search splunk_server=\"MacBookPro.fritz.box\" index=main\n```\n\n2. Translation steps:\n\n   a. We start the ES|QL query with the `FROM` command, using the index pattern `logs-splunk.alert-*` as requested in the guidelines.\n\n   b. The `source=\"tutorialdata.zip:*\"` part in SPL is translated to a `WHERE` condition in ES|QL.\n\n   c. The `search` command in SPL is essentially a filter, which is equivalent to the `WHERE` command in ES|QL. We combine all the conditions from the original SPL query into a single `WHERE` clause.\n\n   d. We use the `AND` operator to combine multiple conditions in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n   e. We keep the field names exactly as they are in the original SPL query, as instructed.\n\n3. The resulting ES|QL query combines all these elements into a single pipeline, using the `|` character to separate commands.\n\nThis translation maintains the intent of the original Splunk rule, which is to filter data based on specific source, splunk_server, and index values. The ES|QL query will retrieve data from the specified index pattern and apply the same filtering conditions as the original SPL query.",

However, in ECS, `observer.hostname` is used to represent the hostname of the system doing the observation, which aligns with the purpose of `splunk_server` in Splunk.\n\n2. `index` to `event.dataset`:\n   - Reason: In Splunk, the `index` field is often used to categorize different types of data. In ECS, `event.dataset` serves a similar purpose, representing a high-level classification of the type of data.\n\n3. `source` field:\n   - The `source` field was left as is because there isn't a clear one-to-one mapping in the provided CIM to ECS map, and its usage here seems to be specific to the data source rather than a standard field.\n\nThese mappings aim to preserve the intent of the original Splunk query while adapting it to the Elastic Common Schema.
