/**
 * Pre-flight fix for ESQL `cluster_block_exception` on closed data-stream backing indices.
 *
 * ESQL has no `ignore_unavailable`. When a data stream has a closed backing index,
 * the entire FROM clause fails at resolution time — before any shard-level exclusion applies.
 * Negating the backing index name alone does NOT help; you must negate the data stream name
 * and re-add only its open backing indices explicitly.
 *
 * Example — input patterns: ['logs-myapp-*', '-logs-myapp-debug-*']
 *   data stream `logs-myapp-prod` has backing indices: [.ds-...-000001 (open), .ds-...-000002 (closed)]
 *   → openBackingIndices: ['.ds-...-000001']
 *   → negations:          ['-logs-myapp-prod']
 *   Caller builds FROM:   logs-myapp-*, .ds-...-000001, -logs-myapp-debug-*, -logs-myapp-prod
 *
 * Both arrays must be spliced into the ESQL FROM-clause pattern list in order:
 *   [...originalPositives, ...openBackingIndices, ...userExclusions, ...negations]
 *
 * Returns `{ openBackingIndices: [], negations: [] }` on empty input or resolve failure.
