/**
 * Append documents to the entity metadata datastream. The datastream is
 * append-only, so the bulk op is `create` rather than `update`. The caller
 * owns the doc shape — this primitive is event-action agnostic so future
 * metadata kinds (behaviors, anomalies, alerts) can reuse it without
 * needing a new write path.
 *
 * Uses `esClient.helpers.bulk` (matching `ingestEntities`) rather than a
 * hand-rolled `esClient.bulk`: the helper streams from the datasource instead
 * of materializing the whole `operations` array, chunks by `flushBytes` so a
 * high-fan-out run can't exceed `http.max_content_length`, and retries 429s.
 * Per-doc drops are surfaced via `onDrop` and logged here; the call resolves
 * to `{ successful, failed }` counts.
 *
 * `refresh` defaults to `false`: this is an append-only history stream
 * written by background maintainers and read asynchronously, so blocking
 * each bulk on a shard refresh only adds latency to maintainer runs. Callers
 * that need read-your-write (e.g. tests) can opt into `'wait_for'`.
