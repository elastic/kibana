The [Elastic Security Labs](http://www.elastic.co/security-labs) team is passionate about securing the world’s data from attack, and strives to raise the bar within the security industry. To this end, Elastic Security Labs has compiled the [2022 Global Threat Report](https://www.elastic.co/explore/security-without-limits/global-threat-report) to share trends and tactics adversaries and attack groups use, as observed by our threat research team and broader user community over the past year.

Let’s dig into a few of the endpoint related findings:

1. 72% of all defense evasion techniques consisted of masquerading and system binary proxy execution

2. ~77% of all credential access techniques are attributed to OS credential dumping with commonly known utilities

Here’s a chart on how the endpoint techniques breakdown across our data set.
