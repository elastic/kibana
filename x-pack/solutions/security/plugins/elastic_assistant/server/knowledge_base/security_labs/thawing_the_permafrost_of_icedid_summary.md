ICEDID is a malware family first [described](https://securityintelligence.com/new-banking-trojan-icedid-discovered-by-ibm-x-force-research/) in 2017 by IBM X-force researchers and is associated with the theft of login credentials, banking information, and other personal information. ICEDID has always been a prevalent family, but has achieved even more growth since EMOTETâ€™s temporary [disruption](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/emotet-botnet-disrupted-international-cyber-operation) in early 2021. ICEDID has been linked to the distribution of other distinct malware families including [DarkVNC](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.darkvnc) and [COBALT STRIKE](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-analysis-report-all-paths-lead-to-cobalt-strike-icedid-emotet-and-qbot). Regular industry reporting, including research publications like this one, help mitigate this threat.

Elastic Security Labs analyzed a recent ICEDID variant consisting of a loader and bot payload. By providing this research to the community end-to-end, we hope to raise awareness of the ICEDID execution chain, highlight its capabilities, and deliver insights about how it is designed.

### Execution Chain

ICEDID employs multiple stages before establishing persistence via a scheduled task and may retrieve components from C2 dynamically. The following diagram illustrates major phases of the ICEDID execution chain.

### Research Paper Overview

Elastic Security Labs described the full execution chain of a recent ICEDID sample in a detailed research [paper](https://www.elastic.co/pdf/elastic-security-labs-thawing-the-permafrost-of-icedid.pdf) hosted at Elastic Security Labs. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of this malware sample and capabilities, including: - Virtualization detection and anti-analysis - C2 polling operations - Shellcode execution methods - Credential access mechanisms - Websocket connections - Installing a web browser proxy to capture all user traffic - Reverse shell and VNC server installation - Certificate pinning - Data validation - ICEDID observable TTPs - Links to useful resources from Elastic

#### YARA

Elastic Security has created multiple YARA rules related to the different stages/components within ICEDID infection, these can be found in the signature linked below: - [Windows.Trojan.ICEDID](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/yara/rules/Windows_Trojan_IcedID.yar)
