Today Elastic Security Labs celebrates another milestone: launching the [2022 Elastic Global Threat Report](https://www.elastic.co/explore/security-without-limits/global-threat-report), our inaugural summary of threat trends, forecasts, and recommendations. We analyzed millions of telemetry events from sources around the world to share these insights with you; all part of our continued commitment to transparency, and our mission to protect the world's data.

You can find the report [here](https://www.elastic.co/explore/security-without-limits/global-threat-report), we're excited to share it with you.
