*Elastic Security Labs discovers that threat actors are taking advantage of readily available and commonly abused security tools, and misconfigured environments.*

Elastic Security Labs has released the [2024 Elastic Global Threat Report](http://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-global-threat-2024), surfacing the most pressing threats, trends, and recommendations to help keep organizations safe for the upcoming year. Threat actors are finding success from the use of offensive security tools (OSTs), a misconfiguration of cloud environments, and a growing emphasis on Credential Access. This report explores key telemetry from over a billion data points with emphasis on malware trends, adversary tactics, cloud security, and generative AI curated by Elastic Security Labs.
