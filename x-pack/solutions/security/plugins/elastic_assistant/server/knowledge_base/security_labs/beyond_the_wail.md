## Preamble

In August 2024, a novel macOS malware named "BANSHEE Stealer" emerged, catching the attention of the cybersecurity community. Reportedly developed by Russian threat actors, BANSHEE Stealer was introduced on an underground forum and is designed to function across both macOS x86_64 and ARM64 architectures. 

This malware presents a severe risk to macOS users, targeting vital system information, browser data, and cryptocurrency wallets.

With a steep monthly subscription price of $3,000, BANSHEE Stealer stands out in the market, particularly compared to known stealers like AgentTesla. 

As macOS increasingly becomes a prime target for cybercriminals, BANSHEE Stealer underscores the rising observance of macOS-specific malware. This analysis explores the technical details of BANSHEE Stealer, aiming to help the community understand its impact and stay informed about emerging threats.

## Key takeaways

* BANSHEE Stealer highlights the growing number of macOS malware samples as the OS becomes a more attractive target for cyber threats.
* BANSHEE Stealer's $3,000 monthly price is notably high compared to Windows-based stealers.
* BANSHEE Stealer targets a wide range of browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and around 100 browser extensions, making it a highly versatile and dangerous threat.

## Malware Analysis

The malware we analyzed in this research contained all the C++ symbols, which is interesting as we can guess the project's code structure by knowing these source code file names, as seen in the picture below. Looking into the C++-generated global variable initialization functions, we can find values set automatically/manually by the user during the build process, like the remote IP, encryption key, build ID, etc.

![Functions list that initialize the global variables of every source file](/assets/images/beyond-the-wail/image5.png "Functions list that initialize the global variables of every source file")

The following table summarizes the leaked `.cpp` file names through the symbols in the binary.

| File name      | Description                                                                                                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Controller.cpp` | Manages core execution tasks, including anti-debugging measures, language checks, data collection, and exfiltration. |
| `Browsers.cpp`   | Handles the collection of data from various web browsers.                                                            |
| `System.cpp`     | Executes AppleScripts to gather system information and perform password phishing.                                    |
| `Tools.cpp`      | Provides utility functions for encryption, directory creation, and compression etc.                                  |
| `Wallets.cpp`    | Responsible for collecting data from cryptocurrency wallets.                                                         |

### Debugger, VM Detection, and Language Checks

![Checking for debugging, Virtualization, and the language of the machine](/assets/images/beyond-the-wail/image8.png "Checking for debugging, Virtualization, and the language of the machine")

BANSHEE Stealer uses basic techniques to evade detection. It detects debugging by utilizing the [sysctl](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/sysctl.3.html) API.

![Debugging detection with sysctl macOS API](/assets/images/beyond-the-wail/image1.png "Debugging detection with sysctl macOS API")

For virtualization detection, it runs the command `system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep 'Model Identifier'` to determine whether the string `Virtual` appears in the hardware model identifier, which suggests a virtual machine. These methods are relatively simple and can be easily circumvented by advanced sandboxes and malware analysts.

![Virtual machine check](/assets/images/beyond-the-wail/image7.png "Virtual machine check")

Additionally, It parses the user-preferred canonicalized language returned from the [CFLocaleCopyPreferredLanguages ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/1542887-cflocalecopypreferredlanguages) API and looks for the string `ru`. This tactic helps the malware avoid infecting systems where Russian is the primary language.

### System information collection

#### User password

The malware creates an [Osascript](https://ss64.com/mac/osascript.html) password prompt with a dialog saying that to launch the application, you need to update the system settings. Please enter your password.

When the user enters the password, it will be validated using the [dscl](https://ss64.com/mac/dscl.html) command by running `dscl Local/Default -authonly <username> <password>`

If valid, the password will be written to the following file `/Users/<username>/password-entered`.

![User password phishing through a prompt](/assets/images/beyond-the-wail/image3.png "User password phishing through a prompt")

These credentials can be leveraged to decrypt the keychain data stored on the system, granting access to all saved passwords.

#### File, software, and hardware information collection

The function `System::collectSystemInfo` collects system information and serializes it in a JSON object. It executes the command `system_profiler SPSoftware DataType SPHardwareDataType`, which provides details about the systemâ€™s software and hardware. It gets the machine's public IP by requesting it from `freeipapi.com` through the built-in macOS `cURL` command.

The JSON file will be saved under `<temporary_path>/system_info.json`

BANSHEE stealer executes AppleScripts; interestingly, it writes the AppleScripts to the same file `/tmp/tempAppleScript`.

The first script to be executed first mutes the system sound with `osascript -e 'set volume with output muted'` command. It then collects various files from the system, which are listed below:

* Safari cookies
* Notes database
* Files with the following extensions `.txt`, `.docx`, `.rtf`, `.doc`, `.wallet`, `.keys`, or `.key` from the Desktop and Documents folders.

#### Dump keychain passwords

It copies the keychain of the system `/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db` to `<temporary_path>/Passwords`

### Browser collection

BANSHEE collects data from 9 different browsers currently, including browser history, cookies, logins, etc:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Brave
* Edge
* Vivaldi
* Yandex
* Opera
* OperaGX

Regarding Safari, only the cookies are collected by the AppleScript script for the current version.

![Web browser file collection](/assets/images/beyond-the-wail/image4.png "Web browser file collection")

Additionally, data from approximately 100 browser plugins are collected from the machine. A list of these extension IDs is provided at the end of the blog post.

The collected files are saved under `<temporary_path>/Browsers`.

### Wallet collection

* Exodus
* Electrum
* Coinomi
* Guarda
* Wasabi Wallet
* Atomic
* Ledger

The collected wallets are stored under `<temporary_path>/Wallets`.

### Exfiltration

After the malware finishes collecting data, it first ZIP compresses the temporary folder using the `ditto` command. The zip file is then XOR encrypted and base64 encoded and sent through a post request to the URL: `http://45.142.122[.]92/send/` with the built-in cURL command.

    meta:
        author = "Elastic Security"
        creation_date = "2024-08-13"
        last_modified = "2024-08-13"
        os = "MacOS"
        arch = "x86, arm64"
        category_type = "Infostealer"
        family = "Banshee"
        threat_name = "Macos.Infostealer.Banshee"
        license = "Elastic License v2"

    strings:
        $str_0 = "No debugging, VM, or Russian language detected." ascii fullword
        $str_1 = "Remote IP: " ascii fullword
        $str_2 = "Russian language detected!" ascii fullword
        $str_3 = " is empty or does not exist, skipping." ascii fullword
        $str_4 = "Data posted successfully" ascii fullword
        $binary_0 = { 8B 55 BC 0F BE 08 31 D1 88 08 48 8B 45 D8 48 83 C0 01 48 89 45 D8 E9 }
        $binary_1 = { 48 83 EC 60 48 89 7D C8 48 89 F8 48 89 45 D0 48 89 7D F8 48 89 75 F0 48 89 55 E8 C6 45 E7 00 }
    condition:
        all of ($str_*) or all of ($binary_*)
}
```

## Conclusion

BANSHEE Stealer is macOS-based malware that can collect extensive data from the system, browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and numerous browser extensions. Despite its potentially dangerous capabilities, the malware's lack of sophisticated obfuscation and the presence of debug information make it easier for analysts to dissect and understand. While BANSHEE Stealer is not overly complex in its design, its focus on macOS systems and the breadth of data it collects make it a significant threat that demands attention from the cybersecurity community.
