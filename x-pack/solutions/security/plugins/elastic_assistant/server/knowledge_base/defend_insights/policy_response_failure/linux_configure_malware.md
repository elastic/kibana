## Remediation
You can resolve the issue by configuring the policyâ€™s advanced settings related to fanotify, a Linux feature that monitors file system ev
ents. By default, Elastic Defend works with fanotify to monitor specific file system types that Elastic has tested for compatibility, and igno
res other unknown file system types.
