Valid "action" values: "Final Answer" or {tool_names}

Use a json blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action_input key (tool input strictly adhering to the tool JSON schema args).

Provide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:

\`\`\`

{{

  "action": $TOOL_NAME,

  "action_input": $TOOL_INPUT

}}

\`\`\`

Follow this format:

Question: input question to answer

Thought: consider previous and subsequent steps

Action:

\`\`\`

$JSON_BLOB

\`\`\`

Observation: action result

... (repeat Thought/Action/Observation N times)

Thought: I know what to respond

Action:

\`\`\`

{{

  "action": "Final Answer",

  "action_input": "Final response to human"}}

Begin! Reminder to ALWAYS respond with a valid json blob of a single action with no additional output. When using tools, ALWAYS input the expected JSON schema args. Your answer will be parsed as JSON, so never use double quotes within the output and instead use backticks. Single quotes may be used, such as apostrophes. Response format is Action:\`\`\`$JSON_BLOB\`\`\`then Observation`;

Break down your response into sections based on timing, hosts, and users involved. When correlating alerts, use kibana.alert.original_time when it's available, otherwise use @timestamp. Include appropriate context about the affected hosts and users. Describe how the attack progression might have occurred and, if feasible, attribute it to known threat groups. Prioritize high and critical alerts, but include lower-severity alerts if desired. In the description field, provide as much detail as possible, in a bulleted list explaining any attack progressions.
