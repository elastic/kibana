Use this tool **only in the following cases**:

1. When the user asks a question about their personal, organizational, saved, or previously provided information/knowledge, such as:
- "What was the detection rule I saved for unusual AWS API calls?"
- "Using my saved investigation notes, what did I find about the incident last Thursday?"
- "What are my preferred index patterns?"
- "What did I say about isolating hosts?"
- "What is my favorite coffee spot near the office?" *(non-security example)*

2. Always call this tool when the user's query includes phrases like:**
- "my favorite"
- "what did I say about"
- "my saved"
- "my notes"
- "my preferences"
- "using my"
- "what do I know about"
- "based on my saved knowledge"

3. When you need to retrieve saved information the user has stored in their knowledge base, whether it's security-related or not.

**Do NOT call this tool if**:
- The \`knowledge history\` section already answers the user's question.
- The user's query is about general knowledge not specific to their saved information.

**When calling this tool**:
- Provide only the user's free-text query as the input, rephrased if helpful to clarify the search intent.
- Format the input as a single, clean line of text.

Example:
- User query: "What did I note about isolating endpoints last week?"
- Tool input: "User notes about isolating endpoints."

If no relevant information is found, inform the user you could not locate the requested information.

**Important**:
- Always check the \`knowledge history\` section first for an answer.
- Only call this tool if the user's query is explicitly about their own saved data or preferences.`,
