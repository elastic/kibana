/**
 * Bumps when an index template's mapping changes in a backwards-compatible
 * way. Adding fields is fine; removing or retyping is not without a
 * reindex strategy.
 *
 * v2: adds `extracted.ioc_set_hash` (keyword) and
 * `provenance.related_reports*` (keyword + integer) to support the
 * Workflow 2 cross-report correlation pass, and adds `template_id` to
 * the subscriptions companion index for pre-staged template provenance.
 *
 * v3: adds `provenance.environment_hits` (object — per-layer counts +
 * computed_at timestamp) and `provenance.environment_hits_total` (integer)
 * for the Workflow 4 hit-provenance-backfill loop, and introduces the
 * indicators companion index template for the IOC indicator sync Task
 * Manager job.
 *
 * v4: adds `delivery.connector_id` to the subscriptions companion index so
 * the `digest_delivery` workflow can dispatch through a configured Kibana
 * actions connector (email / slack) instead of the previous `data.set`
 * placeholder.
 *
 * v5: adds the `extracted.categories` keyword array and the
 * `geography.regions` macro-region keyword array to the threat-reports
 * data stream. Both fields are populated by the stage-2 LLM enrichment
 * step in `nl_extraction_behavioral` and consumed by the visual
 * dashboard's category-breakdown / "Affects You" panels and by
 * `search_reports`'s new `categories[]` / `regions[]` filters. Both
 * arrays are closed enums (see `THREAT_CATEGORIES` / `THREAT_REGIONS` in
 * `common/constants.ts`).
 *
 * v6: adds `space_id` (keyword) to the threat-reports data stream and to
 * each companion index. Single global index, logical per-space isolation:
 * routes filter by `request.getSpaceId()` and writes tag the current
 * space. The sentinel `'*'` means "all spaces" and is reserved for
 * built-ins (seeded sources, global subscriptions) so default content
 * stays visible regardless of which space the request originated from.
 *
 * v7: relocates every plugin-owned index under the `.kibana-threat-*`
 * prefix (data stream + four companion indices + their templates). The
 * mappings are unchanged from v6. The rename is required because the
 * `kibana_system` reserved role only grants access to Kibana-owned
 * patterns (`.kibana*`, `.fleet*`, etc.) — the previous `threat-reports`
 * data stream and `.threat-intel-*` companion indices fell outside that
 * envelope and so creation and read calls from the internal user failed
 * with `security_exception`. There is no in-place migration: previously
 * created `threat-reports` / `.threat-intel-*` resources (none of which
 * could have been written to in any environment that didn't elevate
 * `kibana_system`) are abandoned. See
 * `dev_docs/key_concepts/kibana_system_user.mdx`.
 *
 * v8: adds the tradecraft-style ranking signals to the threat-reports
 * data stream:
 *   - `extracted.relevance` (float 0..1) — LLM-emitted "how actionable
 *     is this report for detection?" score, populated by the stage-2
 *     enrichment in `nl_extraction_behavioral`.
 *   - `extracted.detection_actionability` (keyword) — closed-set
 *     classifier (`informational` / `iocs_only` / `ttps_present` /
 *     `rule_candidate`). See `DETECTION_ACTIONABILITY_LEVELS` in
 *     `common/threat_intelligence/hub/constants.ts`.
 *   - `rank_score` (float) — multiplicative composite of
 *     `severity.score * extracted.relevance` computed at extraction
 *     time. Consumed by `search_reports` when `sort_by: 'rank'` and
 *     by the dashboard's "Top reports" panel. Reports missing this
 *     field (e.g. legacy or pending docs) tie-break to 0 via the
 *     `missing` sort parameter on the read side.
 *
 * v9: closes the hunt → ranking feedback loop. Adds:
 *   - `feedback` (object) — per-report aggregate of the latest
 *     orchestrated-hunt outcome:
 *       * `ioc_hit_count` / `ttp_hit_count` (long) — Tier 1 hit counts.
 *       * `affected_host_count` / `affected_user_count` (long) —
 *         Tier 1 affected-asset cardinality.
 *       * `last_hunted_at` (date) — wall-clock of the latest hunt.
 *       * `last_hunt_status` (keyword) — `HuntForThreatStatus` echo so
 *         downstream consumers can distinguish "no hits in this window"
 *         from "no searchable input" without rerunning the hunt.
 *     Written by `services/write_hunt_feedback.ts` from the orchestrator
 *     after every Tier 1 invocation against a known `report_id`.
 *   - `corroborated_rank_score` (float) — `rank_score * (1 + boost)`
 *     where `boost` is a log-based, monotone, clamped function of the
 *     IOC and TTP hit counts. See the formula in
 *     `services/write_hunt_feedback.ts`. `search_reports` sort_by='rank'
 *     prefers this field over the static `rank_score` so reports
 *     corroborated by environment activity float to the top of digests,
 *     dashboard "Top reports" panel, and any future top-N gating. Bound
 *     to `[rank_score, 1.5 * rank_score]` so a noisy report can never
 *     dominate a clean high-relevance one outright; the boost is
 *     idempotent across reruns of the same hunt window.
 *
 * v10: introduces the advisories companion index template
 * (`.kibana-threat-intel-advisories`) for cross-report LLM-synthesised
 * advisories produced by `services/synthesize_advisory.ts`. One row
 * per advisory carrying the rendered narrative, the recommended actions
 * list, and the report ids that fed the synthesis. No changes to the
 * threat-reports data stream mapping in this bump — companion index
 * additions are always backwards-compatible.
 *
 * v12: adds `copy_to` on `content.title` and `content.body_text` so the
 * `content.title_bm25` / `content.body_text_bm25` siblings are populated at
 * index time (the mapping declared these fields in v1 but omitted copy_to,
 * which made `search_reports` field-sorted modes return zero hits).
 *
 * v13: fixes `copy_to` targets to use full paths (`content.title_bm25`,
 * `content.body_text_bm25`). Relative targets (`title_bm25`) copy to the
 * document root under `dynamic: strict`, which rejected every
 * `source_ingestion` write with `strict_dynamic_mapping_exception`.
 *
 * v11: adds `advisory_id` (keyword) to the digests companion index
 * (`.kibana-threat-intel-digests`). Populated by `digest_delivery` when
 * the agent calls `threat_intel.synthesize_advisory` (with
 * `persist: true`) at the top of the per-subscription render step and
 * weaves the resulting executive summary into the digest markdown.
 * Lets the dashboard cross-link each archived digest back to the
 * advisory row it cites — and lets the per-subscription history pane
 * render "this digest is built around the <theme_title> advisory"
 * without re-running the synthesis. Companion-index addition; the
 * mapping is `dynamic: 'strict'` so the field MUST be declared up-front
 * before any write attempts it.
 *
 * v14: adds Diamond Model extraction fields and source-snapshot fields to the
 * threat-reports data stream. Diamond fields under `extracted.diamond.*`:
 *   - Four vertices (adversary / capability / infrastructure / victim), each with:
 *     * `signal`  (keyword)       — HIGH | PARTIAL | NONE
 *     * `summary` (semantic_text, inference_id: DIAMOND_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT_ID) —
 *       1-3 sentence factual summary; empty when signal is NONE.
 *   - `signal_count`    (integer) — non-NONE vertex count (0..4).
 *   - `model_id`        (keyword) — connector/model that produced the extraction.
 *   - `extracted_at`    (date)    — wall-clock of the extraction run.
 *   - `extraction_mode` (keyword) — 'single_call' | 'per_vertex_fallback'.
 * Source-snapshot fields on `source.*`:
 *   - `admiralty_rating` (keyword) — NATO-style source reliability rating (A–F).
 *   - `tier`             (integer) — feed tier snapshot at ingest.
 * ES validates the `summary` inference_id at document-index time (not at
 * template PUT or rollover). `bootstrap_threat_intelligence` logs an error at
 * startup if the endpoint is absent so operators catch the gap before data flows.

/**
 * Source-agnostic threat reports data stream.
 *
 * Mappings notes:
 * - `content.title` and `content.body_text` are `semantic_text`. We deliberately
 *   omit `inference_id` so Elasticsearch inherits the cluster default at index
 *   creation time (typically Jina v5 on EIS, then ELSER-on-EIS, then ELSER, then
 *   multilingual-e5). This matches Streams' pattern in `storage_settings.ts` and
 *   makes the plugin work transparently across deployments.
 * - `content.title_bm25` and `content.body_text_bm25` are sibling `text` fields
 *   populated via `copy_to` from the `semantic_text` siblings. The
 *   `threat_intel.search_reports` tool uses an RRF retriever over both paths so
 *   semantic search degrades gracefully when inference is unavailable.
 * - `content_fingerprint` is the SHA-256 of the normalized `body_text`. It is
 *   the dedup key against RSS-syndicated copies and is a forward-compat slot
 *   for Phase C alert/telemetry traceback (`provenance.duplicate_of`).
 * - `source.type: 'telemetry'` is reserved for Phase C
 *   (`threat_intel.generalize_from_telemetry`); leaving the enum value in the
 *   keyword field requires no migration when the tool lands.
