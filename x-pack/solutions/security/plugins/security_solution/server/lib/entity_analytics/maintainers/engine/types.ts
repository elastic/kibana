/**
 * ES|QL identifier-quoting convention for config authors.
 *
 * The engine substitutes user-supplied ES|QL fragments (`esqlWhereClause`,
 * `targetEvalOverride`, `customActor.evalOverride`, `additionalTargetFilter`,
 * and the bodies of `esqlQueryOverride` functions) directly into the
 * generated query. ES|QL's identifier rules apply:
 *
 * - **Bare identifiers** (no quoting) work for ECS-style dotted names whose
 *   every segment starts with a letter and contains only alnum + underscore:
 *   `event.action`, `user.target.email`, `host.target.entity.id`. This is
 *   the common case — the four shipped accesses configs and three of the
 *   four communicates_with configs use bare identifiers throughout.
 *
 * - **Backtick-quoted identifiers** (`` `field.name` ``) are REQUIRED when
 *   the dotted name contains a segment that is not a valid bare identifier,
 *   for example a numeric segment or a reserved word:
 *   `` `azure.auditlogs.properties.target_resources.0.type` `` — note the
 *   numeric `.0.` segment. The Azure override uses backticks for every
 *   such field; un-quoted these would be ES|QL parse errors.
 *
 * Forgetting backticks on a dotted-numeric field surfaces as an ES|QL
 * `Unknown column` or `expecting identifier` error at run time, not at
 * compile time. When in doubt, run the produced query against a populated
 * cluster and the parse error will point at the offending identifier.
