 * The risk scoring algorithm uses a Riemann zeta function to sum an entity's risk inputs to a known, finite value (@see RIEMANN_ZETA_VALUE).
 * It does so by assigning each input a weight based on its position in the list (ordered by score) of inputs.
 * This value represents the complex variable s of Re(s) in traditional Riemann zeta function notation.

 * Represents the value calculated by Riemann Zeta function for RIEMANN_ZETA_S_VALUE with 10.000 iterations (inputs) which is the default alertSampleSizePerShard.
 * The maximum unnormalized risk score value is calculated by multiplying RIEMANN_ZETA_S_VALUE by the maximum alert risk_score (100).
