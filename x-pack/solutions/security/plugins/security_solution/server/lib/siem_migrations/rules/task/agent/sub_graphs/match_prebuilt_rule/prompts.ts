const PREBUILT_RULES_SEMANTIC_QUERY_GUIDELINES = `<query_guidelines>
You are extracting keywords from the source SIEM detection rule to build the "query" argument for searchPrebuiltRules — a semantic search over Elastic pre-built detection rule names and descriptions.

Produce a short, keyword-rich query that captures:
- The vendor, product, or technology involved (e.g. AWS, Azure, Windows, Okta, CrowdStrike, Palo Alto, Linux, Fortinet)
- The data source type (e.g. endpoint, network, cloud, authentication, audit logs)
- The type of activity being detected (e.g. process creation, sign-in failure, lateral movement, persistence, exfiltration)

Guidelines:
- The query should be short and concise (one line of space-separated keywords).
- Include keywords that are relevant to the data source and detection use case.
- Add related vendor, product, cloud provider, OS platform keywords you can identify.
- Prefer keywords that appear in Elastic pre-built rule names and descriptions.

Example: the source rule context above may be a raw title/description/query (e.g. for Splunk) or an
already-translated natural language description (e.g. for QRadar/Sentinel) — either way, for a rule
about netsh.exe being abused to persist a malicious proxy via Windows firewall/network configuration
changes, a good query is:
"windows host endpoint netsh.exe process creation command-line utility network configuration persistence proxy dll execution sysmon event id 1"

const buildMatchGuidelines = (bullets: string[]) => `<matching_guidelines>
Evaluate the candidates returned by your last searchPrebuiltRules call:
${bullets.join('\n')}

If one of them is a match, reply with the final JSON described below — do not search again hoping for a better candidate.
searchPrebuiltRules is a semantic similarity search over the whole catalog, so it already returns the rules closest to your query and a reworded query samples almost the same set. When none of the candidates matches, it is far more likely that no Elastic pre-built rule covers this source rule than that a better query exists: reply with the final JSON and an empty "match".
Search again only if you can name a specific defect in the query you just issued. Only these count as defects:
- it used the wrong product vocabulary for this vendor;
- it named the wrong data source or event type;
- it missed the attack technique the source rule detects;
- all returned candidates are completely unrelated to the source rule (different technology, different attack domain, different use case) — this signals the query keywords were wrong, not that no rule exists.
A scope difference alone is not a query defect: if a candidate is merely broader or narrower than the source rule but covers the same use case, answer with an empty "match" instead.
You may call searchPrebuiltRules at most ${MAX_TOOL_CALL_ATTEMPTS} times in total. Once that many queries are listed below, you cannot search again — decide from the candidates you already have and reply with the final JSON.{previousQueries}

- Always reply with a JSON object with the field "match" and the value being the most relevant matched elastic detection rule name if any, else the value should be an emptry string, and a "summary" entry with the reasons behind the match. Do not reply with anything else.
- Only reply with exact matches, if you are unsure or do not find a very confident match, always reply with an empty string value in the match field, do not guess or reply with anything else.
- If the source rule is a much more complex usecase with custom logic not covered by the prebuilt rules, reply with an empty string in the match field.
- If there is only one match, answer with the name of the rule in the "match" key. Do not reply with anything else.
- If there are multiple matches, answer with the most specific of them, for example: "Linux User Account Creation" is more specific than "User Account Creation".
- Finally, write a "summary" in markdown format with the reasoning behind the decision. Starting with "## Prebuilt Rule Matching Summary" followed by a newline. Make sure the content is valid JSON by escaping any necessary special characters.
- Make sure the JSON object is formatted correctly and the values properly escaped.
