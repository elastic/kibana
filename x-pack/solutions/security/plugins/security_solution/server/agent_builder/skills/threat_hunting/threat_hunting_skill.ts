## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Running a proactive threat hunt based on a hypothesis or threat intelligence
- Investigating suspicious activity patterns across security data
- Searching for indicators of compromise (IOCs) — IPs, domains, file hashes, process names
- Identifying statistical anomalies or rare events in security telemetry
- Building baseline behavioral profiles for comparison

## Threat Hunting Process

### 1. Formulate Hypothesis
- Start with a specific, testable hypothesis tied to a MITRE ATT&CK technique or known threat actor TTPs
- Examples: "Attackers are using living-off-the-land binaries for lateral movement", "There is C2 beaconing to low-reputation domains"
- Define the expected data sources and time window (7-30 days for behavioral patterns)

### 2. Identify Data Sources
- Use 'platform.core.list_indices' to discover available security indices
- Common sources: logs-endpoint.events.process-*, logs-endpoint.events.network-*, filebeat-*, winlogbeat-*, packetbeat-*
- Use 'platform.core.get_index_mapping' to understand field availability before querying
- Prefer ECS field names for cross-source portability

### 3. Explore Data Iteratively
- Start with broad queries to establish baselines using 'platform.core.generate_esql' and 'platform.core.execute_esql'
- Always scope queries with @timestamp ranges: WHERE @timestamp >= NOW() - 7 DAYS
- Use STATS ... BY for aggregated views before drilling into raw events
- Chain WHERE clauses to iteratively narrow down — avoid overly complex single queries
- Use LIMIT even in aggregations to prevent excessive output

### 4. Identify Anomalies
- Use COUNT_DISTINCT to identify spread (e.g., how many hosts contacted a suspicious IP)
- Compare current activity against historical baselines
- Look for statistical outliers: rare process names, unusual network destinations, atypical authentication patterns
- Use percentile and standard deviation analysis for volumetric anomalies

### 5. Search for IOCs
- Query for known-bad indicators: IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, registry keys
- Use 'platform.core.search' for exact-match lookups across indices
- Cross-reference findings with threat intelligence sources
- Check for related activity on the same entities within a time window

### 6. Document Findings
- Record the hypothesis, data explored, queries used, and results
- Classify findings: confirmed threat, suspicious (needs more data), or benign
- For confirmed threats, create a case using 'platform.core.cases' to track the investigation
- Cross-reference the alert-analysis skill for triage of confirmed findings

## Query Templates

The following embedded query templates provide common hunting patterns (available as referenced content):
- lateral-movement: Detect lateral movement via remote service creation and suspicious logon types
- c2-beaconing: Identify C2 beaconing through periodic network connection analysis
- brute-force: Detect brute force and credential spraying attempts
- rare-process-execution: Find statistically rare process executions on hosts

## Best Practices
- Always start with a time-bounded hypothesis — do not explore without direction
- Use STATS and aggregations before raw event queries to understand data volume
- Validate findings against known-good baselines before escalating
- Hunt on 7-30 day windows for behavioral patterns; use shorter windows for IOC sweeps
- Operationalize confirmed findings by converting hunt queries into detection rules
- Prefer ECS field names: process.name, process.executable, event.action, source.ip, destination.ip, user.name, host.name
- Document your hunting trail — future analysts need the context`,
