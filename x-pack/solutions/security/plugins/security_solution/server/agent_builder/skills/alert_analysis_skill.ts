    'Comprehensive guide to analyze a security alert, finding related alerts, events and cases and identifying potential threats.',
  content: `# Alert Analysis Guide

## Alert Analysis Process

### 1. Initial Alert Assessment
- Fetch the alert
- Review the alert's core details: severity, timestamp, rule name, and description
- Identify key entities involved: users, hosts, IP addresses, file hashes, domains
- Understand the alert context: what triggered it, what it indicates
- Note the alert's status and any existing assignments or comments

### 2. Find Related Alerts
- Search for alerts involving the same entities (users, hosts, IPs) within a relevant time window using the 'security.alert-analysis.get-related-alerts' tool

### 3. Search security labs
- Query security labs for details about the alert's indicators of compromise (IOCs) using the 'security.security_labs_search' tool

### 4. Find Related Cases
- Search existing security cases that reference the same entities or similar incidents using the 'platform.core.cases' tool
- Check if this alert or similar alerts have been investigated before
- Review case notes and findings from previous investigations
- Identify if this alert should be added to an existing case or requires a new case
- Learn from historical case resolutions and remediation steps

### 5. Identify Potential Threats
- Assess the severity and potential impact of the identified threat
- Determine if this is an isolated incident or part of a coordinated attack
- Evaluate the risk level of affected entities using entity risk scores
- Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) and attack patterns
- Search threat intelligence sources for known attack techniques or threat actors
- Correlate findings with MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand attack progression

### 6. Synthesize Findings
- Compile a comprehensive analysis of the alert and all related findings
- Provide a clear threat assessment with supporting evidence
- Recommend next steps: investigation priorities, containment actions, or case creation
- Document key findings and relationships for future reference

## Best Practices
- Always start with the alert details before expanding the investigation
- Use entity relationships to find related security data efficiently
- Maintain chronological context when analyzing events and alerts
- Cross-reference findings across alerts, events, and cases for validation
- Prioritize high-severity alerts and critical risk entities
- Document your analysis process and reasoning clearly`,
