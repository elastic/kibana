## When to Use

Load when the analyst asks about a **specific host or incident** and needs forensic reconstruction:
- Patient zero identification
- Attack timeline on a named host
- Lateral movement chain between hosts
- Persistence mechanism enumeration

Naming a specific host is **not** sufficient on its own — the question must also require forensic reconstruction (timeline, patient zero, lateral movement, persistence), not configuration/health/software-conflict diagnosis. See "Do not load" below.

Do **not** load for:
- Fleet-wide proactive hunts → threat-hunting
- Alert triage from alert id only → alert-analysis
- Host isolation / kill process / file retrieve → tell the analyst to use **Endpoint response actions** in Security (Fleet / Endpoint details). Do not invoke response-action tools from this skill.
- Conflicting or incompatible security software, including antivirus/AV software (e.g. "does host X have conflicting antivirus", third-party AV conflicts) → elastic-defend-configuration-troubleshooting. Naming a specific host does **not** make this a forensic question — antivirus/AV conflict detection is always configuration troubleshooting, never forensic reconstruction.
- Policy/configuration failures → elastic-defend-configuration-troubleshooting
- Endpoint health and missed check-ins → elastic-defend-configuration-troubleshooting
- Performance/resource troubleshooting → elastic-defend-configuration-troubleshooting
- Output or integration failures → elastic-defend-configuration-troubleshooting

## Scope (read-only)

This skill MUST NOT invoke response actions. On response-action requests, explain that this skill is read-only and direct the analyst to Endpoint response actions in Security; then stop.

## Process

### 1. Discover telemetry scope (when hosts or time window need scoping)
When the question names specific hosts or implies a lookback window, call \`${
    platformCoreTools.listIndices
  }\` with pattern \`logs-endpoint.events.*\` to confirm which Defend telemetry indices are actually available before ES|QL. Skip when the question is already narrowly scoped and you can proceed directly to ES|QL on known \`logs-endpoint.events.*\` indices (${ENDPOINT_TELEMETRY_INDEX_PATTERNS.join(
    ', '
  )}).

### 2. Query with ES|QL
Use \`platform.core.generate_esql\` then \`platform.core.execute_esql\` against the recommended Defend indices.
Always scope \`@timestamp\`. Cite index and query in answers.

### 3. Patient zero
Query process and network indices ordered by @timestamp ASC.
Return earliest host, timestamp, indicator, and delivery-vector hypothesis.

### 4. Attack timeline
Merge process, file, network, and registry events for the host in the time window; sort by \`@timestamp\` ascending.
Present the answer as an explicit chronological timeline — an ordered, timestamp-labeled sequence of events scoped to the named host — not a prose paragraph. **Only include events supported by query results.** If telemetry is sparse or unavailable, state the data gap explicitly and optionally provide a clearly labeled investigation plan (suggested ES|QL queries / indices to check) — do **not** present an expected attack sequence as that host's chronology.

### 5. Lateral movement
Trace outbound internal connections from source host; correlate with process creation on destinations.

### 6. Persistence
Enumerate registry run keys, scheduled tasks, services, and startup items from telemetry indices.

## Tool Selection Guardrails

- Call \`${
    platformCoreTools.listIndices
  }\` when host scope or time window is ambiguous — not required on every turn if ES|QL targets are already clear.
- **Always** use \`platform.core.generate_esql\` and \`platform.core.execute_esql\` for forensic answers.
- Do **not** use \`platform.core.search\` or \`relevance_search\` for reconstruction — they cannot replace scoped ES|QL on Defend telemetry.
- Use \`platform.core.get_index_mapping\` only when field names are uncertain before generating ES|QL.
