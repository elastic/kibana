  content: `# Endpoint Forensic Analysis

## When to Use

Load when the analyst asks about a **specific host or incident** and needs forensic reconstruction:
- Patient zero identification
- Attack timeline on a named host
- Lateral movement chain between hosts
- Persistence mechanism enumeration

Do **not** load for:
- Fleet-wide proactive hunts → threat-hunting
- Alert triage from alert id only → alert-analysis
- Host isolation / kill process / file retrieve → endpoint-response-actions

## Scope (read-only)

This skill MUST NOT invoke response actions. On response-action requests, hand off to endpoint-response-actions and stop.

## Capability Detection (Phase 0 — ALWAYS FIRST)

Before selecting a query path, determine what data sources are available:

1. Call \`osquery.check_integration\` to see if the Osquery integration is installed and agents are enrolled.
2. **If Osquery IS installed and agents are enrolled**: for **live-state** questions (current processes, open sockets, loaded DLLs, registry keys as of now), route to the Osquery path (steps 2b–6b below). For **historical** questions (what happened in the past), use ES|QL on Defend telemetry.
3. **If Osquery is NOT installed**: route all questions to the ES|QL / Defend telemetry path. Inform the analyst that live host interrogation requires the Osquery integration.

Use Osquery when the question asks for **current state** ("what processes are currently running", "which sockets are open right now").
Use ES|QL when the question asks for **historical events** ("what happened at 3am", "timeline of the attack", "patient zero").

Both paths can be combined in a single investigation when both integrations are available.

## Process

### 1. Discover telemetry scope
Call \`${ENDPOINT_FORENSIC_DISCOVER_TELEMETRY_TOOL_ID}\` first with host names and time window from the question.

### 2a. Query with ES|QL (historical / Defend telemetry)
Use \`platform.core.generate_esql\` then \`platform.core.execute_esql\` against the recommended Defend indices.
Always scope \`@timestamp\`. Cite index and query in answers.

### 2b. Query with Osquery (live state — when integration is installed)
For live-state questions, use these Osquery tools in sequence:
- \`osquery.list_saved_queries\` to find prebuilt queries matching the investigative need
- \`osquery.get_table_schema\` to verify column names before authoring a custom query
- \`osquery.run_live_query\` to dispatch a read-only SELECT query to enrolled agents (waits ~30s inline for rows)
- \`osquery.get_live_query_results\` when \`run_live_query\` returns \`status: dispatched\` — pass the \`action_id\` and wait up to 60s for agent rows
- \`osquery.list_packs\` to find Elastic-built packs when the analyst references a pack by name

After rows return, **display them in chat** as a markdown table (columns from the first row, cap at 20 rows with a note if truncated).

### 3. Patient zero
Query process and network indices ordered by @timestamp ASC.
Return earliest host, timestamp, indicator, and delivery-vector hypothesis.

### 4. Attack timeline
Merge process, file, network, and registry events for the host in the time window; sort by \`@timestamp\` ascending.
Present the answer as an explicit chronological timeline — an ordered, timestamp-labeled sequence of events scoped to the named host — not a prose paragraph. If telemetry is sparse or unavailable, still lay out the ordered reconstruction as a timeline skeleton (the sequence of stages to expect for that host), so the response remains a scoped chronological narrative.

### 5. Lateral movement
Trace outbound internal connections from source host; correlate with process creation on destinations.

### 6. Persistence
Enumerate registry run keys, scheduled tasks, services, and startup items from telemetry indices.
When Osquery is available, cross-reference with live \`scheduled_tasks\` and \`startup_items\` tables.

## Tool Selection Guardrails

- **Always** call \`osquery.check_integration\` before using any other \`osquery.*\` tool.
- **Always** call \`${ENDPOINT_FORENSIC_DISCOVER_TELEMETRY_TOOL_ID}\` before ES|QL.
- **Always** use \`platform.core.generate_esql\` and \`platform.core.execute_esql\` for historical forensic answers.
- Do **not** use \`platform.core.search\`, \`relevance_search\`, or repeated \`platform.core.list_indices\` for reconstruction — they cannot replace scoped ES|QL on Defend telemetry.
- Use \`platform.core.get_index_mapping\` only when field names are uncertain before generating ES|QL.
- Use \`osquery.run_live_query\` only for **read-only SELECT queries** on enrolled agents. Never attempt shell execution or mutating Osquery tables.
- When \`osquery.run_live_query\` returns \`status: dispatched\`, **must** call \`osquery.get_live_query_results\` with the \`action_id\` before telling the analyst live dispatch is unavailable.
- When a prebuilt saved query matches, prefer it over authoring a custom query.
