## Team Ownership Lookup

### Table A — Security Solution Teams

| CODEOWNERS Team | GitHub Issue Label | Primary Code Paths |
|---|---|---|
| `@elastic/security-solution` | `Team:SecuritySolution` | `security_solution/` (root-level, shared) |
| `@elastic/security-entity-analytics` | `Team:Entity Analytics` | `server/lib/entity_analytics/`, `public/entity_analytics/` |
| `@elastic/security-detection-engine` | `Team:Detection Engine` | `server/lib/detection_engine/`, `lists/` |
| `@elastic/security-detection-rule-management` | `Team:Detection Rule Management` | `server/lib/detection_engine/rule_management/`, `prebuilt_rules/` |
| `@elastic/security-threat-hunting-investigations` | `Team:Threat Hunting` | `server/lib/timeline/`, `public/timelines/`, `timelines/` |

| `@elastic/kibana-cloud-security-posture` | `Team:Cloud Security` | `cloud_security_posture/`, `cloud_defend/` |
| `@elastic/security-scalability` | `Team:Security Scalability` | (performance, infrastructure) |

### Table B — Platform / Cross-Kibana Teams (commonly misrouted to Security)

| CODEOWNERS Team | GitHub Issue Label | Plugin/Path | Common Security Overlap |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@elastic/kibana-cases` | `team:kibana-cases` | `x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/cases/` | "Add to Case" actions, case attachments |
| `@elastic/kibana-visualizations` | `team:kibana-visualizations` | `x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/lens/` | "Open in Lens" errors |
| `@elastic/ml-ui` | `team:ml-ui` | `x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/ml/` | Anomaly detection jobs |
| `@elastic/fleet` | `Team:Fleet` | `x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/fleet/` | Agent policies, integrations |
| `@elastic/response-ops` | `team:response-ops` | `x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/alerting/`, `actions/`, `task_manager/` | Alert actions, connectors |
| `@elastic/kibana-data-discovery` | `team:kibana-data-discovery` | `src/platform/plugins/shared/discover/` | "Investigate in Discover" |
| `@elastic/kibana-presentation` | `team:kibana-presentation` | `src/platform/plugins/shared/dashboard/`, `inspector/`, `embeddable/` | Inspect modal, dashboard embeds |
| `@elastic/kibana-security` | `team:kibana-security` | `x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/spaces/`, `security/` | Space scoping, RBAC |

**How to look up ownership:** check `owner` in nearest `kibana.jsonc`, fallback to `.github/CODEOWNERS`.

**Cross-team bug decision guide:**
- Security calling platform API incorrectly → Security team owns it
- Platform plugin bug that Security triggers → route to platform team
- Both sides need changes → label both, note which is primary

**When to check docs:** "Expected behavior" says TBD; feature behavior unclear; potential redesign; permission/privilege bug; old bug (filed against earlier version).

## Feature Flags

| Aspect | Location |
|--------|----------|
| All flag definitions and defaults | `common/experimental_features.ts` — `allowedExperimentalValues` |
| React hook to check flags | `useIsExperimentalFeatureEnabled('<flagName>')` from `public/common/hooks/use_experimental_features.ts` |
| Server-side config parsing | `server/config.ts` — parses `xpack.securitySolution.enableExperimental` |
| Redux state path | `app.enableExperimental` |

Default value `true` = enabled for all users; `false` = opt-in, may not reproduce in standard setups.

**Bug validation implications:** A bug against a flag-gated feature (default `false`) affects fewer users. A graduated flag (removed, feature always-on) may have changed the described behavior.

---

## Common Permission / Privilege Patterns

| Bug Mentions | Search For |
|-------------|-----------|
| "superuser" / "admin" | `superuser`, `system_indices_superuser` |
| "read-only" / "viewer" | `viewer`, `SecurityPageName`, capability checks |
| "Rules, Alerts and Exceptions" privilege | `siem.crud`, `SecuritySubFeatureId`, `alerting` privilege checks |
| "Cases" privilege | `cases`, `CasesFeatureId` |
| "custom role" | `createRole`, `privilege`, Kibana space privileges |

---

## High-Bug-Density Areas

Known areas where bugs frequently recur (from real triage runs):

- **ESQL integration points** — shared components (Inspect modal, filter bars, error handlers) assume standard ES search format but break with ESQL responses
- **Cross-space features** — space scoping is frequently incomplete for newer features; check raw `esClient` usage and agnostic saved objects
- **Multi-entry-point actions** — "Add to Case," "Investigate in Timeline," "Ask AI Assistant" are accessible from multiple UI locations; privilege checks may exist on one entry point but not others
- **Date/time-dependent queries** — components sometimes don't re-fetch when the global time picker changes; check if ESQL hooks properly depend on time range props
- **Nested flyouts and z-index** — grid layout mode and multi-flyout scenarios frequently cause layering issues
