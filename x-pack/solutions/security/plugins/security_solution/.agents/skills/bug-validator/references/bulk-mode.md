# Bulk Mode

When processing a list of issues (from a list URL), use a two-pass strategy: quick triage first, then deep-dive on uncertain results.

---

## Two-Pass Strategy

### Pass 1: Quick Triage (all issues)

1. **Fetch the list** — `gh issue list` or `gh api search/issues` (up to 15 issues)
2. **Fetch issue bodies in parallel** — up to 5 concurrent `gh issue view` calls
3. **For each issue, run in parallel:**
   - Parse the bug ticket structure (quick version — title + key signals only)
   - Search for closing PRs:
     ```bash
     gh pr list --repo elastic/kibana --search "<issue_number>" --state merged \
       --json number,title --limit 3
     ```
   - If a merged PR closes the issue → verdict = FIXED (skip deeper analysis)
   - If no PR found → quick code path check (verify feature area still exists)
   - Skip deep diff analysis (Step 2) and detailed test coverage (Step 4)
4. **Present the summary table**
5. **Offer Pass 2** for INCONCLUSIVE items

### Pass 2: Deep-Dive (INCONCLUSIVE items only)

After the summary table, offer:
> "I found N INCONCLUSIVE issues. Would you like me to run a deeper investigation on those? This involves reading source code (Step 1b), checking change history (Step 2), and verifying test coverage (Step 4)."

For each INCONCLUSIVE issue in Pass 2:
- Run Steps 1b + 2 + 4 in full
- Goal: resolve to FIXED, STILL VALID, or OBSOLETE whenever possible
- Present updated verdicts after all deep-dives complete

## Quick Pass vs Full Analysis

| Analysis Step | Quick Pass (Bulk) | Full Analysis (Single) |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Step 0: Parse bug | Title + key signals only | Full structured parsing of all sections |
| Step 1: Code path | Verify feature area exists | Deep search for routes, components, permissions |
| Step 1b: Source code | **Skip** | Read source, trace action sequence, analyze defect |
| Step 2: Change history | **Skip** (unless PR found) | Full git log + diff analysis |
| Step 3: PR cross-ref | Issue number search only | Issue number + keyword search |
| Step 4: Test coverage | **Skip** | Full test search with precondition matching |
| Step 5: Verdict | Based on PR + code existence | Based on all evidence including source code |

## Bulk Output Format

**Summary table:**
```
## Bug Triage Report

**Source:** <URL or label filter>
**Analyzed:** <N> issues | **Date:** <today>

| # | Title | Filed | Version | Verdict | Confidence | Impact | Team | Key Evidence |
|---|-------|-------|---------|---------|------------|--------|------|--------------|
| #12345 | Short title | Jan 10 | 9.3.0 | FIXED | High | high (correct) | EA (correct) | PR #12400 closes it |
| #12346 | Short title | Dec 5 | 9.2.0 | STILL VALID | High | high -> medium | SecSol -> DE | Code unchanged |
| #12347 | Short title | Nov 20 | 8.15.0 | OBSOLETE | Medium | medium (correct) | TH (correct) | Component removed |
| #12348 | Short title | Jan 15 | 9.3.0 | INCONCLUSIVE | N/A | none -> high | EA -> kibana-presentation | Needs UI verification |

Team column format:
- `EA (correct)` — label matches code ownership
- `SecSol -> DE` — labeled SecuritySolution but code owned by Detection Engine
- `none -> TH` — no team label, suggest Threat Hunting
- `EA -> kibana-presentation` — root cause in platform plugin, suggest routing out

### Summary
- **FIXED:** N issues (can likely be closed)
- **OBSOLETE:** N issues (can likely be closed)
- **STILL VALID:** N issues (need attention)
- **INCONCLUSIVE:** N issues (need further investigation)
- **Impact mismatches:** N issues
- **Team label mismatches:** N issues
- **Route to platform team:** N issues
```

After the table, offer deep-dive:
> "Would you like detailed analysis for any specific issues? I recommend reviewing the INCONCLUSIVE items: #12348."

## Duplicate Detection

During bulk triage, watch for issues sharing the same root cause:

- **Same defect, different entry points** — e.g., missing privilege check in entity flyout (#232195) = same bug as document flyout (#250150)
- **Same defect, different reports** — filed at different times against different versions with the same underlying issue
- **Same pattern, different features** — e.g., multiple stale-data-after-mutation bugs in different panels

Flag duplicates in the summary table:
```
| #232195 | Timeline privilege on PUM flyout | STILL VALID | High | Duplicate of #250150 (same root cause: entity flyout TakeAction lacks privilege check) |
```

---

## Progress Tracking

Report progress during large batches:
```
Processing issue 3/12: #248397 - Duplicate privileged users in CSV...
```

For batches >10 issues, present results incrementally — show the summary table after every 5 issues.

---

## Continuing Beyond Batch Limit

If the list contains more than 15 issues:
> "I've analyzed the first 15 issues. There are N more in this list. Would you like me to continue with the next batch?"
