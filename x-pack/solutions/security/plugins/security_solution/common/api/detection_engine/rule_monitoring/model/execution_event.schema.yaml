        Type of a plain rule execution event:
        - message: Simple log message of some log level, such as debug, info or error.
        - status-change: We log an event of this type each time a rule changes its status during an execution.
        - execution-metrics: We log an event of this type at the end of a rule execution. It contains various execution metrics such as search and indexing durations.

        Plain rule execution event. A rule can write many of them during each execution. Events can be of different types and log levels.

        NOTE: This is a read model of rule execution events and it is pretty generic. It contains only a subset of their fields: only those fields that are common to all types of execution events.
