      summary: Delete a detection rule
      description: |
        Delete a detection rule using the `rule_id` or `id` field.

        The URL query must include one of the following:

        * `id` - `DELETE /api/detection_engine/rules?id=<id>`
        * `rule_id`- `DELETE /api/detection_engine/rules?rule_id=<rule_id>`

        The difference between the `id` and `rule_id` is that the `id` is a unique rule identifier that is randomly generated when a rule is created and cannot be set, whereas `rule_id` is a stable rule identifier that can be assigned during rule creation.
