        > warn
        > When used with [API key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api-keys.html) authentication, the user's key gets assigned to the affected rules. If the user's key gets deleted or the user becomes inactive, the rules will stop running.

        > If the API key that is used for authorization has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated the rule, the rule behavior might change.
