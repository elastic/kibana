      summary: Patch a detection rule
      description: |
        Update specific fields of an existing detection rule using the `rule_id` or `id` field.

        The difference between the `id` and `rule_id` is that the `id` is a unique rule identifier that is randomly generated when a rule is created and cannot be set, whereas `rule_id` is a stable rule identifier that can be assigned during rule creation.
        > warn
        > When used with [API key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api-keys.html) authentication, the user's key gets assigned to the affected rules. If the user's key gets deleted or the user becomes inactive, the rules will stop running.

        > If the API key that is used for authorization has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated the rule, the rule behavior might change.
