      $ref: '../../../model/primitives.schema.yaml#/components/schemas/UUID'
      description: A dynamic unique identifier for the rule object. It is randomly generated when a rule is created and cannot be changed after that. It is always a UUID. It is unique within a given Kibana space. The same prebuilt Elastic rule, when installed in two different Kibana spaces or two different Elastic environments, will have different object `id`s.

    RuleSignatureId:
      type: string
      description: A stable unique identifier for the rule object. It can be assigned during rule creation. It can be any string, but often is a UUID. It should be unique not only within a given Kibana space, but also across spaces and Elastic environments. The same prebuilt Elastic rule, when installed in two different Kibana spaces or two different Elastic environments, will have the same `rule_id`s.

    RuleVersion:

        The rule's version number.

        - For prebuilt rules it represents the version of the rule's content in the source [detection-rules](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules) repository (and the corresponding `security_detection_engine` Fleet package that is used for distributing prebuilt rules). 
        - For custom rules it is set to `1` when the rule is created. 
        > info
        > It is not incremented on each update. Compare this to the `revision` field.

    RuleRevision:
      type: integer
      minimum: 0
      description: |
        The rule's revision number.

        It represents the version of rule's object in Kibana. It is set to `0` when the rule is installed or created and then gets incremented on each update.
        > info
        > Not all updates to any rule fields will increment the revision. Only those fields that are considered static `rule parameters` can trigger revision increments. For example, an update to a rule's query or index fields will increment the rule's revision by `1`. However, changes to dynamic or technical fields like enabled or execution_summary will not cause revision increments.

        the rule will generate an alert.

        Required field is an event field that must be present in the source indices of a given rule.

        Related integration is a potential dependency of a rule. It's assumed that if the user installs
        one of the related integrations of a rule, the rule might start to work properly because it will
        have source events (generated by this integration) potentially matching the rule's query.

        NOTE: Proper work is not guaranteed, because a related integration, if installed, can be
        configured differently or generate data that is not necessarily relevant for this rule.

        Related integration is a combination of a Fleet package and (optionally) one of the
        package's "integrations" that this package contains. It is represented by 3 properties:

        - `package`: name of the package (required, unique id)
        - `version`: version of the package (required, semver-compatible)
        - `integration`: name of the integration of this package (optional, id within the package)

        There are Fleet packages like `windows` that contain only one integration; in this case,
        `integration` should be unspecified. There are also packages like `aws` and `azure` that contain
        several integrations; in this case, `integration` should be specified.
