            Used only for when the uploaded script is an archive (ex. zip file).
            This property defines the relative path to the file included in the archive that should be executed
            once its contents are extracted. The path should be relative to the root of the archive.
          example: |
            script.zip contains:
            /bin/script.sh
            /lib/lib.h
            /readme.txt

            executable should be defined as: ./bin/script.sh
