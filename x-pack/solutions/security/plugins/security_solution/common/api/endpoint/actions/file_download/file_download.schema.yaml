            The file identifier is constructed in one of two ways:
            - For Elastic Defend agents (`agentType` of `endpoint`): combine the `action_id` and `agent_id` values using a dot (`.`) separator:
            `{file_id}` = `{action_id}.{agent_id}`
            - For all other agent types: the `file_id` is the `agent_id` for which the response action was sent to.
