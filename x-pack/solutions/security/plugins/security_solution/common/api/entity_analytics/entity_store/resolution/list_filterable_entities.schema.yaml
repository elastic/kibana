      summary: List entities with resolution status for selection UI
      description: >
        Returns a flat list of entities with resolution flags, designed for the
        primary-first selection UI (UX-4). Supports filtering to show only
        primaries + unresolved entities (for primary selection) or only
        unresolved entities (for linking to a primary).
