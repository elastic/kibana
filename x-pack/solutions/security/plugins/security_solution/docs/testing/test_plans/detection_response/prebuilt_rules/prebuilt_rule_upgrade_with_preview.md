### Tickets

- [Users can Customize Prebuilt Detection Rules](https://github.com/elastic/security-team/issues/1974) (internal)
- [Users can Customize Prebuilt Detection Rules: Milestone 3](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/174168)
- [Relax the rules of handling missing base versions of prebuilt rules](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/210358)
- [Tests for prebuilt rule upgrade workflow](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/202078)

### Terminology

- [Common terminology](./prebuilt_rules_common_info.md#common-terminology).
- **CTA to upgrade the prebuilt rule**: the button to upgrade the prebuilt rule currently shown in the Rule Upgrade flyout.
- **customizable rule fields**: fields of prebuilt rules that are modifiable by user and are taken into account when calculating `is_customized`. Full list can be found in [Common information about prebuilt rules](./prebuilt_rules_common_info.md#customizable-rule-fields).

## Requirements

### Assumptions

Assumptions about test environments and scenarios outlined in this test plan.

- [Common assumptions](./prebuilt_rules_common_info.md#common-assumptions).
- A prebuilt rule is shown in the Rule Upgrade table when there's a newer version of this rule in the currently installed package with prebuilt rules.
- It's expected the Prebuilt Rules upgrade workflow works seamlessly even if some or all prebuilt rules may have their **base versions** missing.

### Technical requirements

Non-functional requirements for the functionality outlined in this test plan.

- [Common technical requirements](./prebuilt_rules_common_info.md#common-technical-requirements).

### Product requirements

Functional requirements for the functionality outlined in this test plan.

- [Common product requirements](./prebuilt_rules_common_info.md#common-product-requirements).

User stories:

- User can upgrade a single prebuilt rule to its latest version from the Rule Upgrade table with previewing incoming updates from Elastic and user customizations in the Rule Upgrade flyout. See below user stories that describe this workflow in more detail.
- User can upgrade single prebuilt rules one-by-one via the Rule Upgrade flyout.

User stories for upgrading a rule via the Rule Upgrade flyout:

- User can preview what updates they would receive from Elastic in the latest rule version, per each rule field that has an update from Elastic.
- User can preview their customizations, and which of them will be retained in the rule or overwritten by updates from Elastic, per each rule field that was customized.
- User can compare their customizations with updates from Elastic and see if there are any conflicts between them, per each rule field.
- User can manually resolve conflicts between their customizations and updates from Elastic, per each rule field.
- User can edit the final field values before submitting the update.

User stories for edge cases:

- User can upgrade a rule if its type has been changed by Elastic in the latest version, but can only accept the incoming changes. User customizations, if the rule has any, will be lost on upgrade. We force the user to preview such changes, meaning that users can only do this via the Rule Upgrade flyout, quick upgrade right from the table is not supported.

What should be inside the Rule Upgrade flyout:

- The Rule Upgrade flyout should contain a few tabs:
  - The "Updates" tab.
  - The "Overview" tab.
  - The "Investigation guide" tab.
- On the "Updates" tab:
  - We show the updates from Elastic and the user-customized fields.
  - We show only those fields that are [customizable](./prebuilt_rules_common_info.md#customizable-rule-fields).
  - We don't show technical fields and those that are [not customizable](./prebuilt_rules_common_info.md#non-customizable-rule-fields). They are handled by the upgrade workflow automatically under the hood.
  - We don't show some non-technical fields (rule parameters) as they are also handled by the upgrade workflow automatically under the hood. For example, the `enabled` or `exception_list` fields stay unchanged after upgrade (we retain their values from the current rule version).

## Scenarios

### Rule upgrade workflow: rule previews

#### **Scenario: User can preview prebuilt rules having upgrades**

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule with an upgrade
When user opens the rule preview for the prebuilt rule
Then the preview should open
When user closes the preview
Then it should disappear
```

#### **Scenario: User can upgrade a prebuilt rule using the rule preview**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule with an upgrade
When user opens the rule preview for the prebuilt rule
And upgrades the rule using a CTA in the rule preview
Then the rule should be upgraded to the latest version
And a success message should be displayed after upgrade
And the rule should be removed from the Prebuilt Rules Upgrades page
And user should see the number of rules available to upgrade as initial number minus 1
```

#### **Scenario: User can see correct rule information in the preview before upgrading**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule with an upgrade
When user opens a rule preview for the prebuilt rule
Then the "Updates" tab should be active
When user selects the "Overview" tab
Then all properties of the new version of a rule should be displayed in the correct tab and section of the preview
```

#### **Scenario: Tabs and sections without content should be hidden in the preview before upgrading**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed
And this rule upgrade doesn't have Setup and Investigation guides
When user opens a rule preview for the prebuilt rule
Then the Setup Guide section should NOT be displayed in the Overview tab
And the Investigation Guide tab should NOT be displayed
```

And upgraded prebuilt rule should be removed from the table
When user opens rule details page for that prebuilt rule
Then user should see <field> has an upgraded value user entered and saved in the form
```

**Examples:**

`<field>` is one of

- `data_source`
- `tags`
- `description`
- `references`
- `note`
- `setup`
- `threat_index`
- `new_terms_fields`

#### **Scenario: Customized rule upgrade after preview non-solvable conflicts and accepting suggested field value (ABC diff case, non-solvable by diff algo)**

**Automation**: Jest integration test per \<field\> and 1 bulk Cypress test.

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed
And this rule's <field> is customized
And the <field> has an upgrade resulting to a non-solvable conflict
When user opens the Rule Update Flyout
Then user should see INACTIVE CTA to upgrade the prebuilt rule
And <field> has a conflict
And <field> edit form is shown
And <field> edit form inputs have current customized value
When user saves the form without changes
Then user should see an ACTIVE CTA to upgrade the prebuilt rule
When user clicks on CTA
Then success message should be displayed after upgrade
And upgraded prebuilt rule should be removed from the table
When user opens rule details page for that prebuilt rule
Then user should see <field> has an upgraded value accepted by user
```

**Examples:**

`<field>` = all customizable fields

#### **Scenario: Customized rule upgrade after preview non-solvable conflicts and accepting edited field value (ABC diff case, non-solvable by diff algo)**

**Automation**: Jest integration test per `<field>` and 1 bulk Cypress test.

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed
And this prebuilt rule's <field> is customized
And it has an upgrade resulting to a non-solvable conflict
When user opens the Rule Update Flyout
Then user should see INACTIVE CTA to upgrade the prebuilt rule
And <field> has a conflict
And <field> edit form is shown
And <field> edit form inputs have current customized value
When user edits <field> form and saves it
Then user should see an ACTIVE CTA to upgrade the prebuilt rule
When user clicks on CTA
Then success message should be displayed after upgrade
And upgraded prebuilt rule should be removed from the table
When user opens rule details page for that prebuilt rule
Then user should see <field> has an upgraded value user entered and saved in the form
```

**Examples:**

`<field>` = all customizable fields besides always mergeable fields (`tags`, `references`, `threat_index`, `new_terms_fields`)

### Rule type upgrade

#### **Scenario: Non-customized rule upgrade to a different rule type after preview**

**Automation**: 1 Cypress test.

```Gherkin
Given a non-customized prebuilt rule with an upgrade
When user opens the Rule Update Flyout
Then user should see a CTA to upgrade the prebuilt rule
And a warning message saying rule upgrade changes its type
When user clicks on CTA
Then success message should be displayed after upgrade
And upgraded prebuilt rule should be removed from the table
When user opens rule details page for that prebuilt rule
Then user should see <field> has changed its type
And has upgraded field values
```

#### **Scenario: Customized rule upgrade to a different rule type after preview**

**Automation**: 1 Cypress test.

```Gherkin
Given a customized prebuilt rule with an upgrade
When user opens the Rule Update Flyout
Then user should see a CTA to upgrade the prebuilt rule
And a warning message saying rule upgrade changes its type
And user is gonna lose all customizations
When user clicks on CTA
Then success message should be displayed after upgrade
And upgraded prebuilt rule should be removed from the table
When user opens rule details page for that prebuilt rule
Then user should see <field> has changed its type
And has upgraded field values
```

### Concurrency control

#### **Scenario: User gets notified after someone edited a rule being previewed**

**Automation**: 1 Cypress test.

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule with an upgrade
And <userA> opened Rule Update Preview
And saved custom field values via field forms
When <userB> edits the same rule providing changed field values
Then <userA> should see a notification that rule has been edited
And saved custom field values got discarded
```

#### **Scenario: User gets notified after a new rule versions is released**

**Automation**: 1 Cypress test.

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule with an upgrade
And user opened Rule Update Preview
And saved custom field values via field forms
When a new version of the same rule gets available
Then user should see a notification that a new rule version was detected
And saved custom field values got discarded
```

### Licensing

#### **Scenario: User can NOT modify field values in upgrade preview when license is insufficient**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with a mock rule.

```Gherkin
Given a Kibana instance running under an insufficient license
And a prebuilt rule with an upgrade
When user opens an upgrade preview for this rule
Then user should see a preview of rule field updates
And there should NOT be a possibility to edit any field values
```

#### **Scenario: User is warned about losing their customizations in upgrade preview when license is insufficient**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with a mock rule.

```Gherkin
Given a Kibana instance running under an insufficient license
And a customized prebuilt rule with an upgrade
And the base version exists for this rule
When user opens an upgrade preview for this rule
Then user should see a warning that their customizations will be lost on upgrade
```

#### **Scenario: Prebuilt rule always gets upgraded to the target version when license is insufficient**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with a mock rule.

```Gherkin
Given a Kibana instance running under an insufficient license
And a prebuilt rule with an upgrade
And a base version exists for this rule
And this rule is <customization_state>
When user opens an upgrade preview for this rule and clicks on CTA
Then success message should be displayed after upgrade
And the upgraded prebuilt rule should be removed from the table
And all customizable rule fields should be equal to the target version
```

**Examples:**

`<customization_state>` = `customized` | `not customized`
