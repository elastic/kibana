### Terminology

- [Common terminology](./prebuilt_rules_common_info.md#common-terminology).
- **Callout to upgrade prebuilt rules**: a notification callout shown on the Rule Management page that encourages the user to keep prebuilt rules up-to-date and regularly upgrade them to their latest versions.
- **Callout to upgrade the rule**: is either of the two callouts, depending on the context of a given scenario:
  - a notification callout shown on the Rule Details page that encourages the user to upgrade the rule to its latest version;
  - a notification callout shown on the Rule Editing page that encourages the user to upgrade the rule to its latest version before editing it.
- **rule customization**: a change to a customizable field of a prebuilt rule. Full list of customizable rule fields can be found in [Common information about prebuilt rules](./prebuilt_rules_common_info.md#customizable-rule-fields).

## Scenarios

### Rule upgrade notifications on the Rule Management page

#### **Scenario: User is NOT notified on the Rule Management page when no prebuilt rules are installed**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + 1 integration test with mock rules for the /status endpoint.

```Gherkin
Given no prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then user should NOT see a callout to upgrade prebuilt rules
And user should NOT see a Rule Updates tab
And user should NOT see a number of rules available to upgrade
```

#### **Scenario: User is NOT notified on the Rule Management page when all installed prebuilt rules are up to date**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + 1 integration test with mock rules for the /status endpoint.

```Gherkin
Given <X> prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And all of them are up to date (no new versions are available)
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then user should NOT see a callout to upgrade prebuilt rules
And user should NOT see a Rule Updates tab
And user should NOT see a number of rules available to upgrade

Examples:
  | X    |
  | 1    |
  | 100  |
  | 1250 |
```

#### **Scenario: User is NOT notified on the Rule Management page until the package installation is completed**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + unit tests.

```Gherkin
Given <X> prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And for <Z> of the installed rules there are new versions available
And prebuilt rules package is not installed
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then user should NOT see a callout to upgrade prebuilt rules
And user should NOT see a Rule Updates tab
And user should NOT see a number of rules available to upgrade
When user waits until the the package installation is completed
Then user should see the callout to upgrade prebuilt rules
And user should see the Rule Updates tab
And user should see the number of rules available to upgrade (<Z>)

Examples:
  | X    | Z    |
  | 1250 | 1    |
  | 1250 | 100  |
  | 1250 | 1250 |
```

#### **Scenario: User is notified on the Rule Management page when there are some prebuilt rules to upgrade but there are no more prebuilt rules to install**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + 1 integration test with mock rules for the /status endpoint.

```Gherkin
Given <X> prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And there are no more prebuilt rules available to install
And for <Z> of the installed rules there are new versions available
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then user should see the callout to upgrade prebuilt rules
And user should see the Rule Updates tab
And user should see the number of rules available to upgrade (<Z>)

Examples:
  | X    | Z    |
  | 1250 | 1    |
  | 1250 | 100  |
  | 1250 | 1250 |
```

#### **Scenario: User is notified on the Rule Management page when there are some prebuilt rules to upgrade and some more prebuilt rules to install**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + 1 integration test with mock rules for the /status endpoint.

```Gherkin
Given <X> prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And there are <Y> more prebuilt rules available to install
And for <Z> of the installed rules there are new versions available
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then user should see the callout to upgrade prebuilt rules
And user should see the Rule Updates tab
And user should see the number of rules available to upgrade (<Z>)

Examples:
  | X    | Y    | Z    |
  | 1    | 1249 | 1    |
  | 1249 | 1    | 100  |
  | 1249 | 1    | 1249 |
```

#### **Scenario: User can open the Rule Upgrade table on the Rule Management page**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules.

```Gherkin
Given some prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And for some of the installed rules there are new versions available
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then user should see the Rule Updates tab
When user clicks on the Rule Updates tab
Then the Rule Upgrade table should be displayed
```

#### **Scenario: User can dismiss the prebuilt rule upgrade callout on the Rule Management page**

Currently, we store the callout's state only in the browser memory. This means that a dismissed callout will show up again after the page refresh.

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + unit tests for the callout component.

```Gherkin
Given some prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And for some of the installed rules there are new versions available
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then user should see the callout to upgrade prebuilt rules
When user clicks on the Dismiss button
Then the callout should disappear
When user refreshes the page
Then the callout should appear again
```

```

#### **Scenario: User is notified on the Rule Details page when the rule is outdated and can be upgraded to a new version**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules.

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And the rule is outdated (a new version is available for this rule)
When user opens the Rule Details page
