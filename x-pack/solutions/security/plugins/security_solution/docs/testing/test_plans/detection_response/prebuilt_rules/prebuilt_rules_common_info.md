## Features

Historically, users were only able to install all the available prebuilt rules at once, and later upgrade them all at once to their latest versions from Elastic. Also, users were only able to add or edit notification actions for prebuilt rules, but it was impossible to edit and customize any other rule parameters.

With [Milestone 2](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/174167), we introduced the ability to:

- Install prebuilt rules selectively one-by-one or in bulk.
- Before installing a single rule:
  - Preview its properties.
- Upgrade prebuilt rules selectively one-by-one or in bulk to their latest versions from Elastic.
- Before upgrading a single rule:
  - Preview properties of its latest version.
  - Preview a diff between the currently installed version of the rule and its latest version.

With [Milestone 3](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/174168), we're introducing the ability to:

- Edit and customize prebuilt rules (modify almost all rule parameters, besides rule notification actions).
- Export and import prebuilt rules, including customized ones.
- Upgrade prebuilt rules while keeping the user customizations whenever possible.

Please find more information about Milestone 3 features and user stories in the corresponding test plans.

## Common terminology

Terminology related to the package with prebuilt rules:

- **EPR**: [Elastic Package Registry](https://github.com/elastic/package-registry), service that hosts our **Package**.
- **Air-gapped environment**: an environment where Kibana doesn't have access to the internet. In general, EPR is not available in such environments, except the cases when the user runs a custom EPR inside the environment.
- **Package**: the `security_detection_engine` Fleet package that we use for distributing prebuilt detection rules in the form of `security-rule` assets (saved objects).
- **Real package**: the actual latest stable package distributed and pulled from EPR via Fleet.
- **Rule asset**: `security-rule` asset saved objects distributed via the package. There can be one or many assets per each prebuilt rule in the package. Each asset can represent either the latest version of a prebuilt rule, or one of its prior historical versions.
- **Mock rules**: `security-rule` assets that are indexed into the `.kibana_security_solution` index directly from a test during the test setup phase. This allows us to avoid installing the real package in many tests, because this is a heavy, slow and unreliable operation.

Terminology related to the rule's origin:

- **Custom rule**: a rule created by the user themselves.
- **Prebuilt rule**: a rule created by Elastic and shipped via the package.

Terminology related to the various rule versions that can exist in the system:

- **Base version**, also labeled as `base_version`: the "original" version of a prebuilt rule. This is the version of a rule authored by Elastic as it is installed from the package, without customizations to any fields by the user. It is equal to the prebuilt rule asset from the package that corresponds to the `current_version` of this rule. During the installation of a prebuilt rule its asset data is copied over and becomes an installed prebuilt rule.
- **Current version**, also labeled as `current_version`. This is the version of a rule that the user currently has installed. Can be non-customized (in which case it's equal to the `base_version`) or customized by the user (in which case it's different from the `base_version`). You can think of it as a combination of the `base_version` plus all the user customizations applied to its fields on top of that.
- **Target version**, also labeled as `target_version`. This is a newer version of a rule that contains updates from Elastic and that the user is upgrading the rule to. Currently, we allow users to upgrade prebuilt rules only to their lates versions.
- **Merged version**, also labeled as `merged_version`. This is the version of a prebuilt rule that the rule upgrade workflow proposes to the user by default on upgrade. Can incorporate both user customizations and updates from Elastic, where conflicts between them have been auto-resolved by diff algorithms on a per-field basis.
- We can apply the notion of "versions" to rules as a whole or to each rule field separately.
- Base version's `rule.version` always == current version's `rule.version`.
- Current version's `rule.version` always < target version's `rule.version`.

Terminology related to prebuilt rule customization:

- **Customized prebuilt rule**: an installed prebuilt rule that has been changed by the user in the way rule fields semantically differ from the base version. Also referred to as "Modified" in the UI.
  - A customized prebuilt rule has one or more customized fields.
  - For a customized prebuilt rule, `current_version` != `base_version`.
- **Non-customized prebuilt rule**: an installed prebuilt rule that has rule fields values matching the base version.
  - A non-customized prebuilt rule doesn't have any customized fields.
  - For a non-customized prebuilt rule, `current_version` == `base_version`.
- **Customized field**: a prebuilt rule's field which value differs from the value from the originally installed prebuilt rule.
  - For a customized field, `current_version.field` != `base_version.field`.
- **Non-customized field**: a prebuilt rule's field that has the original value from the originally installed prebuilt rule.
  - For a non-customized field, `current_version.field` == `base_version.field`.
- **Customizable rule field**: a rule field that is able to be customized on a prebuilt rule. A comprehenseive list can be found in `./shared_assets/customizable_rule_fields.md`.
- **Non-customizable rule field**: a rule field that is unable to be customized on a prebuilt rule. A comprehenseive list can be found in `./shared_assets/non_customizable_rule_fields.md`.

Terminology related to the "rule source" object:

- **Rule source**, also known as `ruleSource` and `rule_source`: a rule field that defines the rule's origin. Can be `internal` or `external`. Currently, custom rules have `internal` rule source and prebuilt rules have `external` rule source.
- **`is_customized`**: a field within `ruleSource` that exists when rule source is set to `external`. It is a boolean value based on if the rule has been changed from its base version.

Terminology related to UI and UX:

- **CTA**: "call to action", usually a button, a link, or a callout message with a button, etc, that invites the user to do some action.

## Common assumptions

Unless explicitly indicated otherwise:

- Scenarios in the test plans only apply to prebuilt detection rules. Some scenarios may apply to both prebuilt and custom detection rules, in which case it should be clearly stated.
- EPR is available for fetching the package with prebuilt rules.
- Only the latest **stable** package with prebuilt rules is checked for installation/upgrade. Pre-release packages are ignored.
- User is on the following licenses/tiers:
  - on the `Basic` license in a self-hosted or ECH environment;
  - on the `Essentials` tier in a Serverless Security environment.
- User has the required [privileges for managing detection rules](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/detections-permissions-section.html).

## Common non-functional requirements

- Package installation, rule installation and rule upgrade workflows should work:
  - regardless of the package type: with historical rule versions or without;
  - regardless of the package registry availability: i.e., they should also work in air-gapped environments.
- Rule installation and upgrade workflows should work with packages containing up to 15000 historical rule versions. This is the max number of versions of all rules in the package. This limit is enforced by Fleet.
- Kibana should not crash with Out Of Memory exception during package installation.
- For test purposes, it should be possible to use detection rules package versions lower than the latest.
