    Use the detections APIs to create and manage detection rules. Detection
    rules search events and external alerts sent to Elastic Security and
    generate detection alerts from any hits. Alerts are displayed on the
    **Alerts** page and can be assigned and triaged, using the alert status to
    mark them as open, closed, or acknowledged.

        Migrations favor data integrity over shard size. Consequently, unused or
        orphaned indices are artifacts of

        the migration process. A successful migration will result in both the
        old and new indices being present.

        As such, the old, orphaned index can (and likely should) be deleted.


        While you can delete these indices manually,

        the endpoint accomplishes this task by applying a deletion policy to the
        relevant index, causing it to be deleted

        after 30 days. It also deletes other artifacts specific to the migration
        implementation.

        Migrations are initiated per index. While the process is neither
        destructive nor interferes with existing data, it may be
        resource-intensive. As such, it is recommended that you plan your
        migrations accordingly.

    InvestigationFields:
      description: >
        Schema for fields relating to investigation fields. These are user
        defined fields we use to highlight

        in various features in the UI such as alert details flyout and
        exceptions auto-population from alert.

        Added in PR #163235

        Right now we only have a single field but anticipate adding more related
        fields to store various

        configuration states such as `override` - where a user might say if they
        want only these fields to

        display, or if they want these fields + the fields we select. When
        expanding this field, it may look

        something like:

        ```typescript

        const investigationFields = z.object({
          field_names: NonEmptyArray(NonEmptyString),
          override: z.boolean().optional(),
        });

    RelatedIntegration:
      description: >
        Related integration is a potential dependency of a rule. It's assumed
        that if the user installs

        one of the related integrations of a rule, the rule might start to work
        properly because it will

        have source events (generated by this integration) potentially matching
        the rule's query.


        NOTE: Proper work is not guaranteed, because a related integration, if
        installed, can be

        configured differently or generate data that is not necessarily relevant
        for this rule.


        Related integration is a combination of a Fleet package and (optionally)
        one of the

        package's "integrations" that this package contains. It is represented
        by 3 properties:


        - `package`: name of the package (required, unique id)

        - `version`: version of the package (required, semver-compatible)

        - `integration`: name of the integration of this package (optional, id
        within the package)


        There are Fleet packages like `windows` that contain only one
        integration; in this case,

        `integration` should be unspecified. There are also packages like `aws`
        and `azure` that contain

        several integrations; in this case, `integration` should be specified.


        @example

        const x: RelatedIntegration = {
          package: 'windows',
          version: '1.5.x',
        };


        @example

        const x: RelatedIntegration = {
          package: 'azure',
          version: '~1.1.6',
          integration: 'activitylogs',
        };

    RequiredField:
      description: >
        Describes an Elasticsearch field that is needed for the rule to
        function.


        Almost all types of Security rules check source event documents for a
        match to some kind of

        query or filter. If a document has certain field with certain values,
        then it's a match and

        the rule will generate an alert.


        Required field is an event field that must be present in the source
        indices of a given rule.


        @example

        const standardEcsField: RequiredField = {
          name: 'event.action',
          type: 'keyword',
          ecs: true,
        };


        @example

        const nonEcsField: RequiredField = {
          name: 'winlog.event_data.AttributeLDAPDisplayName',
          type: 'keyword',
          ecs: false,
        };

        - going to run - @deprecated Replaced by the 'running' status but left
        for backwards compatibility with rule execution events already written
        to Event Log in the prior versions of Kibana. Don't use when writing
        rule status changes.

        - running - Rule execution started but not reached any intermediate or
        final status.

        - partial failure - Rule can partially fail for various reasons either
        in the middle of an execution (in this case we update its status right
        away) or in the end of it. So currently this status can be both
        intermediate and final at the same time. A typical reason for a partial
        failure: not all the indices that the rule searches over actually exist.

        - failed - Rule failed to execute due to unhandled exception or a reason
        defined in the business logic of its executor function.

        - succeeded - Rule executed successfully without any issues. Note: this
        status is just an indication of a rule's "health". The rule might or
        might not generate any alerts despite of it.

      rules search events and external alerts sent to Elastic Security and
      generate detection alerts from any hits. Alerts are displayed on the
      **Alerts** page and can be assigned and triaged, using the alert status to
      mark them as open, closed, or acknowledged.

      the rule becomes inactive, the rule will stop running.
