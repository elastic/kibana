/**
 * Adds the Threat Intelligence entry to Kibana global sidenav as well as the
 * Security sidenav. The top-level entry retains the indicators page name
 * (`SecurityPageName.threatIntelligence`) so existing role bindings keyed on
 * `${SECURITY_FEATURE_ID}.threat-intelligence` continue to gate the whole
 * area without migration.
 *
 * The Intelligence Hub dashboard — folded in from the standalone
 * threat-intelligence plugin — is registered as a child deep link so
 * it surfaces as `Security > Threat Intelligence > Intelligence Hub` in the
 * sub-nav. Sharing the parent's capability list intentionally:
 * Phase 4 of the migration plan will split capabilities into sub-feature
 * privileges; until then the existing one continues to gate both children.
