 * a single atomic step rather than a loop of single deletes that can half-succeed.
 *
 * The endpoint accepts at most {@link MAX_BULK_DELETE_ATTACHMENTS} ids per request. An attack
 * can carry far more alerts than that, so larger sets are sent as sequential batches — the
 * attack attachment goes in the first batch so a failure part-way through can never leave the
 * attack behind while its alerts are gone. Callers pass the attack id first.
