# Observability Case Suggestion Registry

The system enables a Large Language Model (LLM) to act as an investigative assistant. Given a partially populated case (alerts, services, time ranges, etc.), the LLM proposes and executes strategies to discover additional signals (e.g., SLOs, logs, synthetics) that may support the investigation. These signals are presented as suggested attachments.
