 * with no parseable check-in, or an id that can't be embedded in an Elastic
 * Agent condition, are omitted (they can never be a valid shard target).

 * Paginated: a location's single agent policy can hold more than one page of
 * agents, and dropping the overflow would silently exclude them as shard targets
 * and from health/capacity. Bounded on Fleet's `total` with a hard page cap so a
 * misbehaving paginator can't spin forever; stays within ES's default 10k
 * `from + size` window. `showInactive: false` lets Fleet drop long-unenrolled
 * agents, but its ~6-min inactivity threshold is far looser than our staleness
 * window, so health detection stays the caller's responsibility.
