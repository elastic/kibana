# Uptime Manual Test Plan

This plan outlines the manual testing steps for the Uptime application. It leverages the Synthetics app for data generation, as it is the primary source of Uptime data.

## Feature testing

### Create monitors (via Synthetics App)

The easiest way to generate data for the Uptime app is by creating monitors in the Synthetics app. The following steps should be performed there.

1. Create a Single Page browser monitor.
2. Create a Multistep monitor.
3. Create an HTTP Ping monitor.
4. Create a TCP Ping monitor.
5. Create an ICMP Ping monitor.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Enable the Uptime App:** The Uptime app is hidden by default if no data is present. To ensure it is always visible for testing, navigate to **Stack Management > Advanced Settings** and enable the `observability:enableLegacyUptimeApp` setting.
2.  **Set the Index Pattern:** To view data from Synthetics monitors, navigate to the **Uptime > Settings** page and change the "Indices" field to `synthetics-*`.

### Uptime Overview Page

1.  Navigate to the Uptime app.
2.  Ensure all monitors created in the previous step are displayed in the main list.
3.  Verify that the snapshot counts ("Up", "Down", etc.) at the top of the page are accurate.
4.  Use the search bar to filter the monitors by name and verify the results are correct.
5.  Test the filter pills:
    - Filter by `Status` (Up, Down).
    - Filter by `Type` (browser, http, etc.).
    - Filter by `Location`.
    - Filter by `Tags`.
6.  Verify that the "Pings over time" chart accurately reflects the status of the monitors within the selected time range.
7.  Click on a monitor's name in the list. Ensure it navigates you to that monitor's detail page.
8.  Select `All permitted spaces` in the Spaces dropdown and make sure all monitors from all accessible spaces are shown.
9.  Test the sorting functionality for the monitor list (e.g., by name, by status).

### Uptime Monitor Detail Page

1.  From the Uptime Overview page, click on a monitor to navigate to its detail page.
2.  Verify that the header correctly displays the monitor's name, URL, and current status.
3.  Check that the "Pings over time" chart shows the historical status for this specific monitor.
4.  Use the time filter to select a different time range and verify that the chart and the ping history list update correctly.
5.  In the "Ping history" list at the bottom, verify that individual check results are displayed with the correct status, duration, and timestamp.
6.  If the monitor has failed, ensure that a clear error message is visible in the ping history.
7.  If the monitor runs from multiple locations, use the location filter at the top of the page to filter the view and verify the data updates.

### Test Run Detail Page (Browser Monitors)

1.  From the Monitor Detail page for a **browser** monitor, click on a specific test run in the "Ping history" list to navigate to its detail page.
2.  Verify the page displays a breakdown of the steps for that specific test run.
3.  Click on an individual step.
4.  Ensure the **waterfall chart** is displayed for the selected step, showing the network requests and performance timings.
5.  Interact with the waterfall chart to ensure its features (like filtering and inspecting requests) are working as expected.

### Certificates Page

1.  Navigate to the "Certificates" tab within the Uptime app.
2.  Verify that any TLS certificates associated with your monitors are listed.
3.  Test the search bar to filter for a specific certificate.
4.  Test the sorting functionality, especially sorting by "Expires in" to find certificates that are expiring soon.
5.  Click on a certificate to ensure it navigates to a filtered view of the monitors that use it.
