    Create a new agent key for APM.

    The user creating an APM agent API key must have at least the `manage_own_api_key` cluster privilege and the APM application-level privileges that it wishes to grant.

    After it is created, you can copy the API key (Base64 encoded) and use it to to authorize requests from APM agents to the APM Server.
