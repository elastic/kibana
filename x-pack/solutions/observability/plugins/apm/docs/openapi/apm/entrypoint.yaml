      A source map allows minified files to be mapped back to original source code--allowing you to maintain the speed advantage of minified code, without losing the ability to quickly and easily debug your application.
      
      For best results, uploading source maps should become a part of your deployment procedure, and not something you only do when you see unhelpful errors. That's because uploading source maps after errors happen won't make old errors magically readable--errors must occur again for source mapping to occur.
