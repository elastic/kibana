  summary: Upload a source map
  description: >
    Upload a source map for a specific service and version.
    You must have `all` Kibana privileges for the APM and User Experience feature.

    The maximum payload size is `1mb`.
    If you attempt to upload a source map that exceeds the maximum payload size, you will get a 413 error.
    Before uploading source maps that exceed this default, change the maximum payload size allowed by Kibana with the `server.maxPayload` variable.
