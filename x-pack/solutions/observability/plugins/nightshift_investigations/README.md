# Nightshift Investigations Plugin

This plugin provides the domain API for starting and reading investigations, independent of which entity (significant event, alert, etc.) triggers them.

## Requirements

Nightshift investigations are being moved onto the shared `agenticInvestigations` plugin (an investigation is an Agent Builder conversation) and its proposed actions onto the `proposals` plugin. Both are optional dependencies and disabled by default:

```yaml
xpack.agenticInvestigations.enabled: true
xpack.proposals.enabled: true
```

They are **not** enabled in any serverless or stateful default config yet. Enabling them adds visible surface (Kibana features in role management, workflow step types, the proposals managed workflow), so that waits until the shared investigation experience is ready. Until then, environments that run Nightshift (for example customer zero) enable both in their own config, and local development adds them to `config/kibana.dev.yml`. When either plugin is disabled, Nightshift investigations report themselves unavailable.

### Privileges

The `agenticInvestigations` and `proposals` routes require the `manage_investigations`, `read_proposals`, and `manage_proposals` API privileges. The Nightshift feature grants them, so a Nightshift user does not need the `agenticInvestigations` or `proposals` feature privileges to call those routes:

| Nightshift privilege | Grants |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `manage_investigations`, `read_proposals`, `manage_proposals` |
| `read` | `read_proposals` |

These API privileges are not scoped to Nightshift: they cover every agentic investigation and proposal in the space, including those created by other solutions, plus the investigation routes that share `manage_investigations` (status, assignment, impact, user profile suggestions).

`agenticInvestigations` has no read-only investigations privilege yet, so a user with Nightshift `read` cannot use its investigation routes. UI capabilities are scoped to the feature that owns them, so capabilities like `agenticInvestigations.showInvestigations` and `proposals.showProposals` still need the `agenticInvestigations` and `proposals` features. Opening the investigation conversation in Agent Builder still needs the Agent Builder feature privileges.
