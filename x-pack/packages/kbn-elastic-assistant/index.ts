// To integrate the assistant into a Kibana app, perform the following three steps:

// Step 1: Wrap your Kibana app in the `AssistantProvider` component. This typically
// happens in the root of your app. Optionally provide a custom title for the assistant:

/** provides context (from the app) to the assistant, and injects Kibana services, like `http` */
export { AssistantProvider, useAssistantContext } from './impl/assistant_context';

// Step 2: Add the `AssistantOverlay` component to your app. This component displays the assistant
// overlay in a modal, bound to a shortcut key:

/** modal overlay for Elastic Assistant conversations */
export { AssistantOverlay } from './impl/assistant/assistant_overlay';

// In addition to the `AssistantOverlay`, or as an alternative, you may use the `Assistant` component
// to display the assistant without the modal overlay:

/** this component renders the Assistant without the modal overlay to, for example, render it in a Timeline tab */
export { Assistant } from './impl/assistant';

// Step 3: Wherever you want to bring context into the assistant, use the any combination of the following
// components and hooks:
// - `NewChat` component
// - `NewChatById` component
// - `useAssistantOverlay` hook

/**
 * `NewChat` displays a _New chat_ icon button, providing all the context
 * necessary to start a new chat. You may optionally style the button icon,
 * or override the default _New chat_ text with custom content, like `ðŸª„âœ¨`
 *
 * USE THIS WHEN: All the data necessary to start a new chat is available
 * in the same part of the React tree as the _New chat_ button.

 * of a context that was (already) registered by the `useAssistantOverlay` hook. You may
 * optionally style the button icon, or override the default _New chat_ text with custom
 * content, like {'ðŸª„âœ¨'}
 *
 * USE THIS WHEN: all the data necessary to start a new chat is NOT available
 * in the same part of the React tree as the _New chat_ button. When paired
 * with the `useAssistantOverlay` hook, this option enables context to be be
 * registered where the data is available, and then the _New chat_ button can be displayed
 * in another part of the tree.

 *
 * USE THIS WHEN: You want to register context in one part of the tree, and then show
 * a _New chat_ button in another part of the tree without passing around the data, or when
 * you want to build a custom `New chat` button with features not not provided by the
 * `NewChat` component.
