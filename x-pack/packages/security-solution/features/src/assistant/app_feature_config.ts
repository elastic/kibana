 * App features privileges configuration for the Security Assistant Kibana Feature app.
 * These are the configs that are shared between both offering types (ess and serverless).
 * They can be extended on each offering plugin to register privileges using different way on each offering type.
 *
 * Privileges can be added in different ways:
 * - `privileges`: the privileges that will be added directly into the main Security feature.
 * - `subFeatureIds`: the ids of the sub-features that will be added into the Security subFeatures entry.
 * - `subFeaturesPrivileges`: the privileges that will be added into the existing Security subFeature with the privilege `id` specified.
