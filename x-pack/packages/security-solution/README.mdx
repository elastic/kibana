## Security Solution package

This package compiles components used by Security Solution

### Lazy by default

All components are exported to be lazily-loaded with a default `React.Suspense` default most appropriate to its nature.

If a page needs to alter the `React.Suspense` behavior, (e.g. a different "loading" component), one can import the `Lazy[ComponentName]` version and surround it with a custom `React.Suspense` component.
