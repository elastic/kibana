    "reference": "BLISTER, a malware loader initially discovered by Elastic Security Labs in 2021 and associated with financially-motivated intrusions, is a testament to this trend as it continues to develop additional capabilities. Two years after its initial discovery, BLISTER continues to receive updates while flying under the radar, gaining momentum as an emerging threat. Recent findings from Palo Alto’s Unit 42 describe an updated SOCGHOLISH infection chain used to distribute BLISTER and deploy a payload from MYTHIC, an open-source Command and Control (C2) framework.\n\nView the full research on Elastic Security Labs"

    "reference": "ICEDID is a malware family first described in 2017 by IBM X-force researchers and is associated with the theft of login credentials, banking information, and other personal information. ICEDID has always been a prevalent family, but has achieved even more growth since EMOTET’s temporary disruption in early 2021. ICEDID has been linked to the distribution of other distinct malware families including DarkVNC and COBALT STRIKE. Regular industry reporting, including research publications like this one, help mitigate this threat.\n\nDetections and preventions\nDetection logic\nEnumeration of Administrator Accounts\nCommand Shell Activity Started via RunDLL32\nSecurity Software Discovery using WMIC\nSuspicious Execution from a Mounted Device\nWindows Network Enumeration\nUnusual DLL Extension Loaded by Rundll32 or Regsvr32\nSuspicious Windows Script Interpreter Child Process\nRunDLL32 with Unusual Arguments\nPreventions (source: https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/)\nMalicious Behavior Detection Alert: Command Shell Activity\nMemory Threat Detection Alert: Shellcode Injection\nMalicious Behavior Detection Alert: Unusual DLL Extension Loaded by Rundll32 or Regsvr32\nMalicious Behavior Detection Alert: Suspicious Windows Script Interpreter Child Process\nMalicious Behavior Detection Alert: RunDLL32 with Unusual Arguments\nMalicious Behavior Detection Alert: Windows Script Execution from Archive File\nYARA\nElastic Security has created multiple YARA rules related to the different stages/components within ICEDID infection, these can be found in the signature linked below: - Windows.Trojan.ICEDID\n\nMore information can be found in this Elastic Security Labs post."

    "reference": "SPECTRALVIPER code analysis\nOverview\nDuring our investigation, we observed a previously-undiscovered backdoor malware family that we’re naming SPECTRALVIPER. SPECTRALVIPER is a 64-bit Windows backdoor coded in C++ and heavily obfuscated. It operates with two distinct communication modes, allowing it to receive messages either via HTTP or a Windows named pipe.\n\nThrough our analysis, we have identified the following capabilities:\n\nPE loading/Injection : SPECTRALVIPER can load and inject executable files, supporting both x86 and x64 architectures. This capability enables it to execute malicious code within legitimate processes.\nToken Impersonation : The malware possesses the ability to impersonate security tokens, granting it elevated privileges and bypassing certain security measures. This enables unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive resources.\nFile downloading/uploading : SPECTRALVIPER can download and upload files to and from the compromised system. This allows the attacker to exfiltrate data or deliver additional malicious payloads to the infected machine.\nFile/directory manipulation : The backdoor is capable of manipulating files and directories on the compromised system. This includes creating, deleting, modifying, and moving files or directories, providing the attacker with extensive control over the victim's file system.\n\nFor more information, visit the Elastic Security Labs post."

    "input": "How does Elastic Security Labs use kernel call stacks to detect threats living in memory?",
    "reference": "With Elastic Security 8.8, Elastic Security Labs added new kernel call stack based detections which provide improved efficacy against in-memory threats. A call stack is the ordered sequence of functions that are executed to achieve a behavior of a program. It shows in detail which functions (and their associated modules) were executed to lead to a behavior like a new file or process being created. Knowing a behavior’s call stack, we can build detections with detailed contextual information about what a program is doing and how it’s doing it. The new call stack based detection capability leverages our existing deep in-line kernel visibility for the most common system behaviors (process, file, registry, library, etc). With each event, we capture the call stack for the activity. This is later enriched with module information, symbols, and evidence of suspicious activity. This gives Elastic Defend procmon-like visibility in real-time, powering advanced preventions for in-memory tradecraft.\n\nView this post for more information."

    "reference": "Impairing defenses by tampering with cloud logging functionality was one of the most common techniques observed in the later part of 2022 and continues into 2023 - This likely impacted visibility of other techniques due to missing data sources, and is potentially a reaction to improvements in cloud logging - XMRig prevalence exploded on MacOS, likely as a result of macroeconomic conditions.

    "reference": "Yes, one such malware variant is RUSTBUCKET. RUSTBUCKET adds persistence capabilities not previously observed and, at the time of reporting, is undetected by VirusTotal signature engines. Elastic Defend behavioral and prebuilt detection rules provide protection and visibility for users. We have also released a signature to prevent this malware execution.\n\nThe research into REF9135 used host, binary, and network analysis to identify and attribute intrusions observed by this research team, and other intelligence groups, with high confidence to the Lazarus Group; a cybercrime and espionage organization operated by the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea (DPRK).\n\nView this post for the full research article."

    "input": "How does Elastic Defend help agaist threats like BPFDoor?",
    "reference": "BPFDoor is a backdoor payload specifically crafted for Linux. Its purpose is for long-term persistence in order to gain re-entry into a previously or actively compromised target environment. It notably utilizes BPF along with a number of other techniques to achieve this goal, taking great care to be as efficient and stealthy as possible. \n\nElastic Security Labs has several detections that can detect and prevent BPDoor. They have also published Yara signatures for it.\n\nThe following Elastic Detection Rules will identify BPFDoor activity:\n\nAbnormal Process ID or Lock File Created\nBinary Executed from Shared Memory Directory\n\nThe yara signature can be found here.\n\nMore details on BPFDoor can be found in this Elastic Security Labs post."
