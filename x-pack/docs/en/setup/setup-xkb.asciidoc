{xpack} is an Elastic Stack extension that bundles security, alerting,
monitoring, reporting, machine learning, and graph capabilities.

It adds the following pages to the side navigation:

* **APM**
* **Machine Learning**
* **Graph**
* **Monitoring**


The **Management** page gains options related to configuring security. The
**Dev Tools** page gains a Search Profiler and a Grok Debugger. Where these and
other {xpack} features are mentioned in this documentation, we've added an icon
to clearly indicate that what you're reading pertains to features available only
in {xpack}.
