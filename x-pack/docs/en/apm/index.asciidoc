Elastic Application Performance Monitoring (APM) automatically collects in-depth
performance metrics and errors from inside your applications.

The **APM** page in {kib} is provided with the {xpack} basic license. It
enables developers to drill down into the performance data for their applications
and quickly locate the performance bottlenecks.

For more information about the components of Elastic APM, see
{apm-get-started-ref}/overview.html[APM Overview].
