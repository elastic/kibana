== Getting Started

If you have not already installed and configured Elastic APM, the
**APM > Getting Started** page in {kib} provides information to help you
complete the setup.

After you install the Elastic APM agent library in your application, the
application automatically appears in the APM UI in {kib}. No further
configuration is required.

If you also use Elastic Stack for logging and server-level metrics, you can
optionally import the APM dashboards that come with the APM Server. You can use
these APM-specific visualizations to correlate APM data with other data sources.
To get the dashboards, run the following command on the APM server:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------
./apm-server setup
----------------------------------------------------------

//For more setup information, see
//{apm-get-started-ref}/index.html[Getting Started with APM].
