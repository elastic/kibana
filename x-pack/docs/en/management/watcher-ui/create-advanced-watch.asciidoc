=== Create Advanced Watch

Advanced watches are for people who are more familiar with Elasticsearch query syntax and the watcher framework overall. The creation UI is more closely aligned with using the REST apis directly. Please reference the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html[Elasticsearch query DSL] for more information.

To create a new advanced watch:

. Select the `Create new watch` button

. Select `Advanced Watch`

==== Advanced Watch UI

This screen lets you define the core properties of an advanced watch.

image:management/watcher-ui/images/advanced-watch/advanced-watch-create.png["Create Advanced Watch",link="management/watcher-ui/images/advanced-watch/advanced-watch-create.png"]

The `ID` refers to the identifier used by Elasticsearch, whereas `Name` is the more user-friendly way to identify the watch. Refer to the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/how-watcher-works.html#watch-definition[Watch definition documentation] for the Watch JSON.

=== Simulate

This screen allows you to override parts of the watch and then run a simulation of it.

Some implementation details on overrides:

* Trigger overrides use https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/common-options.html#date-math[date math]
* Input override accepts a JSON blob that overrides the `input`.
* Condition overrides is just a checkbox to indicate if you want to force the condition to always be true.
* Action overrides support multiple options, which are https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/watcher-api-execute-watch.html#watcher-api-execute-watch-action-mode[explained here]

=== Simulated

After starting the simulation, the UI will show a results screen.

The possible simulation statuses for watches are:

* `Firing` - The watch is currently triggered and is actively performing the associated actions.
* `Error` - The watch is an error state and not properly working.
* `Ok` - The watch is not actively firing but working properly.
* `Disabled` - The watch will not fire under any circumstance.
