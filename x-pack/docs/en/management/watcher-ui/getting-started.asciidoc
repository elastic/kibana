=== Getting Started

To use the {watcher} UI, you need to create users with {watcher} specific roles 
as <<watcher-security,described here>>.

To access {watcher} UI within {kib}:

. Open {kib} in your web browser and log in. If you are running {kib}
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`.

. Click **Management** in the side navigation, then select **Watcher** under `Elasticsearch`.

The watch list page within {watcher} UI enables you to view all existing watches including stateful information about each watch. This includes `State`, `Last Fired` and `Last Triggered`.

The possible states for watches are:

* `Firing` - The watch is currently triggered and is actively performing the associated actions.
* `Error` - The watch is an error state and not properly working.
* `Ok` - The watch is not actively firing but working properly.
* `Disabled` - The watch will not fire under any circumstance.

To delete or edit a watch, click on its checkbox in the list and then click the Delete or Edit button. Watches that do not have a checkbox are <<cluster-alerts,cluster alerts>> created by {monitoring} and are immutable.

This page also allows you to create a <<watcher-create-threshold-alert, threshold alert>> or <<watcher-create-advanced-watch, an advanced watch>>. Let's first look at creating a threshold alert.
