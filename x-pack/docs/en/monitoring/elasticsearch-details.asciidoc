=== {es} Monitoring Metrics

You can drill down into the status of your {es} cluster in {kib} by clicking
the <<cluster-overview-page, Overview>>, <<nodes-page, Nodes>>, and
<<indices-overview-page, Indices>> links on the *Monitoring* page.

See also {ref}/es-monitoring.html[Monitoring {es}].

==== Cluster Overview

To view the key metrics that indicate the overall health of an {es} cluster,
click **Overview** in the {es} section. Anything that needs your attention is
highlighted in yellow or red.

TIP: Conditions that require your attention are listed at the top of the
Clusters page. You can also set up watches to alert you when the status
of your cluster changes. To learn how, see
{xpack-ref}/watch-cluster-status.html[Watch Your Cluster Health].

The panel at the top shows the current cluster statistics, the charts show the
search and indexing performance over time, and the table at the bottom shows
information about any shards that are being recovered.

TIP: Not sure what a chart is showing? Click the info button for a description
of the metrics.

From there, you can dive into detailed metrics for particular nodes and indices.

==== Nodes

To view node metrics, click **Nodes**. The Nodes section shows the status
of each node in your cluster.

[[nodes-page-overview]]
===== Node Overview

Click the name of a node to view its node statistics over time. These represent
high-level statistics collected from {es} that provide a good overview of health.

[[nodes-page-advanced]]
===== Node Advanced

To view advanced node metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for a node. The
*Advanced* tab shows additional metrics, such as memory and garbage collection
statistics reported by the selected {es} node.

You can use the advanced node view to diagnose issues that generally involve
more advanced knowledge of {es}, such as poor garbage collection performance.

[[indices-overview-page]]
==== Indices

To view index metrics, click **Indices**. The Indices section shows the same
overall index and search metrics as the Overview and a table of your indices.

[float]
[[indices-page-overview]]
===== Index Overview

From the Indices listing, you can view data for a particular index. To drill
down into the data for a particular index, click its name in the Indices table.

[float]
[[indices-page-advanced]]
===== Index Advanced

To view advanced index metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for an index. The
*Advanced*  tab shows additional metrics, such as memory statistics reported
about the {es} index. If the index has more than one shard, then its shards
might live on more than one node.

The Advanced index view can be used to diagnose issues that generally involve
more advanced knowledge of {es}, such as wasteful index memory usage.
