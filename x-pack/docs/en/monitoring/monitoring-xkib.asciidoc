== Configuring Monitoring in {kib}

{monitoring} gives you insight into the operation of your {stack}. For more 
information, see <<xpack-monitoring,{monitoring}>> and 
{stack-ov}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the {stack}]. 

. To monitor {kib}:

.. Verify that the `xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` setting is `true` on
the production cluster. If that setting is `false`, which is the default value,
the collection of monitoring data is disabled in {es} and data is ignored from
all other sources. For more information, see
{ref}/monitoring-settings.html[Monitoring Settings in {es}].

.. Verify that `xpack.monitoring.enabled` and
`xpack.monitoring.kibana.collection.enabled` are set to `true`, which are the
default values. For more information, see <<monitoring-settings-kb>>.

.. Identify where to send monitoring data. {kib} automatically
sends metrics to the {es} cluster specified in the `elasticsearch.url` setting
in the `kibana.yml` file. This property has a default value of
`http://localhost:9200`. This cluster is often referred to as the
_production cluster_.
+
--
TIP: If {security} is enabled on the production cluster, use an HTTPS URL such
as `https://<your_production_cluster>:9200` in this setting.

--

. To visualize monitoring data:

.. Verify that `xpack.monitoring.ui.enabled` is set to `true`, which is the
default value. For more information, see <<monitoring-settings-kb>>.

.. Identify where to retrieve monitoring data from. If you want to use a
separate _monitoring cluster_, set `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url` in the
`kibana.yml` file. Otherwise, the monitoring data is stored in the production
cluster.
+
--
TIP: If {security} is enabled on the monitoring cluster, use an HTTPS URL such
as `https://<your_monitoring_cluster>:9200` in this setting.

To learn more about typical monitoring architectures with separate
production and monitoring clusters, see
{xpack-ref}/how-monitoring-works.html[How Monitoring Works].

. If {security} is enabled on the production cluster:

.. Verify that there is a
valid user ID and password in the `elasticsearch.username` and
`elasticsearch.password` settings in the `kibana.yml` file. These values are
used when {kib} sends monitoring data to the production cluster.

.. Configure {kib} to encrypt communications between the {kib} server and the
production cluster. This set up involves generating a server certificate and
setting `server.ssl.*` and `elasticsearch.ssl.certitifcateAuthorities` settings
in the `kibana.yml` file on the {kib} server. For example:
+
--
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
server.ssl.key: /path/to/your/server.key
server.ssl.certificate: /path/to/your/server.crt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using your own certificate authority to sign certificates, specify
the location of the PEM file in the `kibana.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: /path/to/your/cacert.pem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For more information, see <<using-kibana-with-security>>.
--

. If {security} is enabled on the monitoring cluster:

.. Identify a user ID and password that {kib} can use to retrieve monitoring
data. Specify these values in the `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.username` and
`xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password` settings in the `kibana.yml` file.
If these settings are omitted, {kib} uses the `elasticsearch.username` and
`elasticsearch.password` setting values.

.. Configure {kib} to encrypt communications between the {kib} server and the
monitoring cluster. Specify the `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.*` settings
in the `kibana.yml` file on the {kib} server.
+
--
For example, if you are using your own certificate authority to sign
certificates, specify the location of the PEM file in the `kibana.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: /path/to/your/cacert.pem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--

. Restart {kib}.

. If {security} is enabled on your {kib} server:

.. Log in to {kib} as a user who has both the `kibana_user` and
`monitoring_user` roles. These roles have the necessary privileges to view the
monitoring dashboards. For example:
+
--
[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /_xpack/security/user/stack-monitor
{
  "password" : "changeme",
  "roles" : [ "kibana_user", "monitoring_user" ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
--

.. If you are accessing a remote monitoring cluster, you must log in to {kib}
with username and password credentials that are valid on both the {kib} server
and the monitoring cluster.
