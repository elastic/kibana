[[xpack-monitoring]]
= Monitoring the Elastic Stack

[partintro]
--
The {monitoring} components enable you to easily monitor the Elastic Stack
from {kibana-ref}/introduction.html[Kibana].
You can view health and performance data for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and
Kibana in real time, as well as analyze past performance.

When you install {xpack}, a monitoring agent runs on each Elasticsearch,
Kibana, and Logstash instance to collect and index metrics.

By default, metrics are indexed within the cluster you are monitoring.
Setting up a <<monitoring-cluster, dedicated monitoring cluster>> ensures
you can access historical monitoring data even if the cluster you're
monitoring goes down. It also enables you to monitor multiple clusters
from a central location.

When you use a dedicated monitoring cluster, the metrics collected by the
Logstash and Kibana monitoring agents are shipped to the Elasticsearch
cluster you're monitoring, which then forwards all of the metrics to
the monitoring cluster.
