You can enable {monitoring} in {es}, Logstash, {kib}, and Beats. By default, the
monitoring agents on {es} index data within the same cluster.

TIP: If you have a dedicated monitoring cluster, the information is accessible
even if the {es} cluster you're monitoring is not. You can send data from
multiple clusters to the same monitoring cluster and view them all through the
same instance of {kib}. For  more information, see

To view and analyze the health and performance of {es}, Logstash, {kib}, and
Beats:

. {ref}/configuring-monitoring.html[Configure monitoring in {es}]. If you want
to use a separate monitoring cluster, see
{xpack-ref}/monitoring-production.html[Monitoring in a Production Environment].

. <<monitoring-xpack-kibana,Configure monitoring in {kib}>>.

. {logstash-ref}/configuring-logstash.html[Configure monitoring in Logstash].

. Configure monitoring in {auditbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Auditbeat],
{filebeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Filebeat],
{heartbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Heartbeat],
{metricbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Metricbeat],
{packetbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Packetbeat], and
{winlogbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Winlogbeat].

. Open {kib} in your web browser and log in. If you are running {kib}
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`. To access {kib} and view the
monitoring dashboards, you must log in as a user who has the `kibana_user`
and `monitoring_user` roles.

. Click **Monitoring** in the side navigation. This displays any cluster alerts
that require your attention and a summary of the available monitoring metrics
for {es}, Logstash, {kib}, and Beats. To view additional information, click the
Overview, Nodes, Indices, or Instances links.
