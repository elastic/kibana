[[xkb-enhancements-6.2.0]]
=== Enhancements

Machine Learning::
* Enhanced the creation of custom URLs for existing jobs. When you edit jobs,
there is a new *Custom URLs* tab, which provides options for creating a link to
a {kib} dashboard or a different URL.
// Repo: x-pack-kibana
// Pull: 4130

Management::
* Renamed the *Save* button *Save &amp; Deploy*. This change makes it clearer
that when you click the button the pipeline is saved to an {es} index and
deployed to any Logstash instances that are configured to run it.
// Repo: x-pack-kibana
// Pull: 3599
* Added the ability to clone pipelines in {kib}. When you click the *Clone*
button, data from the original pipeline is used to pre-populate the new pipeline
form.
// Repo: x-pack-kibana
// Pull: 3786
* Enabled auto-sizing of the pipeline configuration text area. The text area
automatically grows or shrinks as you type out a pipeline definition.
// Repo: x-pack-kibana
// Pull: 4026

Monitoring::
* Added resolved alerts to the list of alerts that are visible during a selected
time frame in {kib}.
// Repo: x-pack-kibana
// Pull: 4064
* Added the interval size for aggregated metrics in the tooltip for each chart.
// Repo: x-pack-kibana
// Pull: 3540, 3632
* Improved error handling such that generic `500` errors provide better messages.
// Repo: x-pack-kibana
// Pull: 3744
* Redesigned the Logstash Pipelines view to provide more actionable information
in a tabular format.
// Repo: x-pack-kibana
// Pull: 3661
* Added a basic detail drawer to the Logstash Pipeline Viewer. When you click on
any vertex in the Pipeline Viewer, the drawer slides open. It shows basic
information about the vertex that was clicked and any metrics, if available.
// Repo: x-pack-kibana
// Pull: 3738

Reporting::
* By default, weekly `.reporting` indices created after upgrading to 6.2 use a
single primary shard and have the `auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather
than a fixed setting of 1 replica. As a result, these indices can have a green
status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node clusters.
// Repo: x-pack-kibana
// Pull: 3781
