==== Enhancements

Dashboard::
*  If you had a chance to check out the new Dashboard Only Mode in 6.0.0-beta1,
we've changed things up a bit for 6.0.0-beta2. Previously we required you to
flag every role a user belonged to as being in the View dashboards only mode
in order for that user to be flagged as a Dashboard only mode user. In this
new set up, we created a reserved role, `kibana_dashboard_only_user`, that is
already pre-configured with read only access to the .kibana index, and set up
to be in Dashboard Only Mode. All you have to add is this one role to any user
and they will now be a Dashboard Only Mode user. We also got rid of this new
setting in the Roles UI, as this one role should suffice for most user's setups.
If you have a more complicated setup, such as multi-tenancy with multiple
`.kibana` indexes, you can create more dashboard only mode roles by adding
role names to the `xpackDashboardMode:roles` advanced setting. For more
information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-dashboard-only-mode.html[Kibana Dashboard Only Mode].

Monitoring::
* Added a tip in the pipeline viewer in {kib} when a pipeline contains a plugin
that does not have an id explicitly set in its configuration options. If you
specify an ID, you can track differences across pipeline changes. For more
information, see
{logstash-ref}/logstash-pipeline-viewer.html[Pipeline Viewer UI].
