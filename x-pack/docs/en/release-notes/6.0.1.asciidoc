=== Bug Fixes


Machine Learning::
* Fixed scenarios where clicking the "View examples" link in the Anomalies
section of the Single Metric Viewer or Anomaly Explorer caused the browser to hang.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/3308[#3308] (issues: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/issues/2947[#2947], https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/issues/2976[#2976])
* Fixed scenarios where the Anomaly Explorer or Single Metric Viewer failed to
plot metric data in the charts due to a blank field name in a detector. This
problem was specific to jobs that were originally created in 5.4.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/3443[#3443] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/issues/3419[#3419])

Monitoring::
* Fixed problems viewing pipelines in {kib} from a Firefox web browser.
For more information, see
{logstash-ref}/logstash-pipeline-viewer.html[Pipeline Viewer UI].
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/3051[#3051] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/issues/2808[#2808])
* The `xpack.monitoring.node_resolver` setting, which was deprecated in 5.5.0,
now allows only the `uuid` value to be used. This setting will be removed in 7.0. 
//For more information about this setting, see
//{kibana-ref}/monitoring-settings-kb.html[Monitor Settings in {kib}]
//TBD: Was this setting intentionally removed from 6.0 documentation?
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/3085[#3085]
