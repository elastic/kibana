==== Bug fixes

Dev Tools::
* Fixed issue with input not being accepted in the *Sample Data* or
*Grok Pattern* fields in the Grok Debugger.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/2667[#2667] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/issues/2646[#2646])

Machine Learning::
* Fixed the position of text that appears when you hover over anomalies in {ml}
charts in a Safari web browser.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/2825[#2825] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/issues/2810[#2810])
// * [ML] Removing hardcoded query delay from simple job creation wizards
// OMIT: First fixed in 5.6.3
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/2755[#2755]
* Fixed {ml} charts so that they plot nulls as gaps rather than zeroes. This
change provides a more accurate visual indication of gaps in the data.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/2746[#2746]
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/2824[#2824] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/issues/2746[#2746])
* Added support for periods in field names when you create jobs or datafeeds in
{kib}.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/2821[#2821] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/issues/2807[#2807])
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/2807[#2807] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/issues/2800[#2800])

Security::
* Ensured that privileged information does not appear in the error message when
a {kib} login attempt fails.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/2754[#2754] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/issues/2751[#2751])

Watcher::
* Fixed problem related to creating a threshold-based alert in {kib} with a
Safari web browser. For example, the dialogs related to choosing fields and
aggregations were not shown in that browser.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/2853[#2853] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/issues/2372[#2372])
* Fixed incorrect watch states in {kib}. In particular, the UI now respects the
actual state of the watch when exceptions occur in its input or condition.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/pull/2394[#2394]
