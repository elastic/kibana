==== Breaking Changes

Reporting::
* When {security} is enabled, reports will only be accessible to the user that created them.
* When {security} is enabled, user authorization is controlled by the
`xpack.reporting.roles.allow` setting in the `kibana.yml` which defaults to
`['reporting_user']`. Users will no longer have access to the underlying {reporting}
indices in {es} when assigned to the built-in `reporting_user` role. If using
custom reporting roles, the privileges to the indices will need to be removed, and the
role will need to be added to the `xpack-reporting.roles.allow` setting.
