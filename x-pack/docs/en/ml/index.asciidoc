As datasets increase in size and complexity, the human effort required to
inspect dashboards or maintain rules for spotting infrastructure problems,
cyber attacks, or business issues becomes impractical. The {xpackml} features
automatically model the normal behavior of your time series data — learning
trends, periodicity, and more — in real time to identify anomalies, streamline
root cause analysis, and reduce false positives.

{xpackml} runs in and scales with {es}, and includes an
intuitive UI on the {kib} *Machine Learning* page for creating anomaly detection
jobs and understanding results.

You can use the *Job Management* pane to create and manage jobs and their
associated {dfeeds}:

You can use the *Settings* pane to add scheduled events to calendars and to
associate these calendars with your jobs:

The *Anomaly Explorer* and *Single Metric Viewer* display the results of your
{ml} jobs.  For example:

NOTE: The {xpack} {ml} features in {kib} use pop-ups. You must configure your
web browser so that it does not block pop-up windows or create an exception for
your Kibana URL.

For more information about {ml}, see
{xpack-ref}/xpack-ml.html[Machine Learning in the Elastic Stack].
