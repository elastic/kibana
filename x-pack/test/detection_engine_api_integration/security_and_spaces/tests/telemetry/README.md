These are tests for the telemetry rules within "security_solution/server/usage"
* detection_rules
* legacy_notifications

Detection rules are tests  around each of the rule types to affirm they work such as query, eql, etc...
Legacy notifications are tests around the legacy notification telemetry. Once legacy notifications are removed,
these tests can be removed too.
