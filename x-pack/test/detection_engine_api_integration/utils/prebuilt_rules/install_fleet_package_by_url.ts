  // Prebuilt rules are assets that Fleet indexes as saved objects of a certain type.
  // Fleet does this via a savedObjectsClient.import() call with explicit `refresh: false`.
  // So, despite of the fact that the endpoint waits until the prebuilt rule assets will be
  // successfully indexed, it doesn't wait until they become "visible" for subsequent read
  // operations.
  // And this is usually what we do next in integration tests: we read these SOs with utility
  // function such as getPrebuiltRulesAndTimelinesStatus().
  // Now, the time left until the next refresh can be anything from 0 to the default value, and
  // it depends on the time when savedObjectsClient.import() call happens relative to the time of
  // the next refresh. Also, probably the refresh time can be delayed when ES is under load?
  // Anyway, this can cause race condition between a write and subsequent read operation, and to
  // fix it deterministically we have to refresh saved object indices and wait until it's done.
