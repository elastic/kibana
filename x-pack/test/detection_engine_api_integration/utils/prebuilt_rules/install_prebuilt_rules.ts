  // successfully indexed, it doesn't wait until they become "visible" for subsequent read
  // operations.
  // And this is usually what we do next in integration tests: we read these SOs with utility
  // function such as getPrebuiltRulesAndTimelinesStatus().
  // This can cause race conditions between a write and subsequent read operation, and to
  // fix it deterministically we have to refresh saved object indices and wait until it's done.
