# Cypress Tests

The `security_solution/cypress` directory contains functional UI tests that execute using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

Currently with Cypress you can develop `functional` tests.

If you are still having doubts, questions or queries, please feel free to ping our Cypress champions:

## How to add a new Cypress test

Before considering adding a new Cypress tests, please make sure you have added unit and API tests first. Note that, the aim of Cypress
is to test that the user interface operates as expected, hence, you should not be using this tool to test REST API or data contracts.

First take a look to the [**Development Best Practices**](#development-best-practices) section.
Then check check [**Folder structure**](#folder-structure) section to know where is the best place to put your test, [**Test data**](#test-data) section if you need to create any type
of data for your test, [**Running the tests**](#running-the-tests) to know how to execute the tests and [**Debugging your test**](#debugging-your-test) to debug your test if needed.

Please, before opening a PR with the new test, please make sure that the test fails. If you never see your test fail you don’t know if your test is actually testing the right thing, or testing anything at all.

Note that we use tags in order to select which tests we want to execute:

- `@serverless` includes a test in the Serverless test suite for PRs (the so-called first quality gate). You need to explicitly add this tag to any test you want to run in CI for open PRs. These tests will run against a local, "simulated" serverless environment.
- `@serverlessQA` includes a test in the Serverless test suite for QA (the so-called second quality gate). You need to explicitly add this tag to any test you want to run in the CD pipeline against real serverless projects deployed in the Serverless QA environment.
  - **NOTE:** We are adding this tag temporarily until we check the behavior of our tests in the second quality gate.
- `@ess` includes a test in the normal, non-Serverless test suite. You need to explicitly add this tag to any test you want to run against a non-Serverless environment.
- `@brokenInServerless` excludes a test from the Serverless test suite (even if it's tagged as `@serverless`). Indicates that a test should run in Serverless, but currently is broken.
- `@skipInServerless` excludes a test from the Serverless test suite (even if it's tagged as `@serverless`). Could indicate many things, e.g. "the test is flaky in Serverless", "the test is Flaky in any type of environemnt", "the test has been temporarily excluded, see the comment above why".

Please, before opening a PR with a new test, make sure that the test fails. If you never see your test fail you don’t know if your test is actually testing the right thing, or testing anything at all.

## Running the tests

### Run them locally
When running the tests, FTR is used to spawn both a Kibana instance (http://localhost:5620) and an Elasticsearch instance (http://localhost:9220) with a preloaded minimum set of data (see preceding "Test data" section).

Run the tests with the following yarn scripts from `x-pack/test/security_solution_cypress`:

| Script Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| cypress | Runs the default Cypress command |
| cypress:open:ess | Opens the Cypress UI with all tests in the `e2e` directory. This also runs a local kibana and ES instance. The kibana instance will reload when you make code changes. This is the recommended way to debug and develop tests. |
| cypress:open:serverless | Opens the Cypress UI with all tests in the `e2e` directory. This also runs a mocked serverless environment. The kibana instance will reload when you make code changes. This is the recommended way to debug and develop tests. |
| cypress:run:ess | Runs all tests tagged as ESS placed in the `e2e` directory excluding `investigations` and `explore` directories in headless mode |
| cypress:run:cases:ess | Runs all tests under `explore/cases` in the `e2e` directory related to the Cases area team in headless mode |
| cypress:ess | Runs all ESS tests with the specified configuration in headless mode and produces a report using `cypress-multi-reporters` |
| cypress:run:respops:ess | Runs all tests related to the Response Ops area team, specifically tests in `detection_alerts`, `detection_rules`, and `exceptions` directories in headless mode |
| cypress:run:serverless | Runs all tests tagged as SERVERLESS in the `e2e` directory excluding `investigations` and `explore` directories in headless mode |
| cypress:investigations:run:ess | Runs all tests tagged as ESS in the `e2e/investigations` directory in headless mode |
| cypress:explore:run:ess | Runs all tests tagged as ESS in the `e2e/explore` directory in headless mode |
| cypress:investigations:run:serverless | Runs all tests tagged as SERVERLESS in the `e2e/investigations` directory in headless mode |
| cypress:explore:run:serverless | Runs all tests tagged as SERVERLESS in the `e2e/explore` directory in headless mode |
| junit:merge | Merges individual test reports into a single report and moves the report to the `junit` directory |

Please note that all the headless mode commands do not open the Cypress UI and are typically used in CI/CD environments. The scripts that open the Cypress UI are useful for development and debugging.

## Debugging your test

In order to be able to debug any Cypress test you need to open Cypress on visual mode. [Here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/debugging)
you can find an extended guide about how to proceed.

If you are debugging a flaky test, a good tip is to insert a `cy.wait(<some long milliseconds>)` around async parts of the tes code base, such as network calls which can make an indeterministic test, deterministically fail locally.

## Folder Structure

Below you can find the folder structure used on our Cypress tests.

### e2e/

Cypress convention starting version 10 (previously known as integration). Contains the specs that are going to be executed.

### e2e/explore and e2e/investigations

These directories contain tests which are run in their own Buildkite pipeline. 

If you belong to one of the teams listed in the table, please add new e2e specs to the corresponding directory.

| Directory | Area team |
| -- | -- |
| `e2e/explore` | Threat Hunting Explore |
| `e2e/investigations | Threat Hunting Investigations |

### fixtures/

Cypress convention. Fixtures are used as external pieces of static data when we stub responses.

### plugins/

Cypress convention. As a convenience, by default Cypress will automatically include the plugins file cypress/plugins/index.js before every single spec file it runs.

### objects/

Contains representations of data used across different tests; our domain objects.

### screens/

Contains the elements we want to interact with in our tests.

Each file inside the screens folder represents a screen in our application. When the screens are complex, e.g. Hosts with its multiple tabs, the page is represented by a folder and the different important parts are represented by files.

Example:

- screens
  - hosts
    - all_hosts.ts
    - authentications.ts
    - events.ts
    - main.ts
    - uncommon_processes.ts

### tasks/

_Tasks_ are functions that may be reused across tests.

Each file inside the tasks folder represents a screen of our application. When the screens are complex, e.g. Hosts with its multiple tabs, the page is represented by a folder and the different important parts are represented by files.

Example:

- tasks
  - hosts
    - all_hosts.ts
    - authentications.ts
    - events.ts
    - main.ts
    - uncommon_processes.ts

### urls/

Represents all the URLs used during the tests execution.

## Test data

The data the tests need:

- Is generated on the fly using our application APIs (preferred way)
- Is ingested on the ELS instance using the `es_archiver` utility

By default, when running the tests in Jenkins mode, a base set of data is ingested on the ELS instance: a set of auditbeat data (the `auditbeat` archive). This is usually enough to cover most of the scenarios that we are testing.

### How to generate a new archive

**Note:** As mentioned above, archives are only meant to contain external data, e.g. beats data. Due to the tendency for archived domain objects (rules, signals) to quickly become out of date, it is strongly suggested that you generate this data within the test, through interaction with either the UI or the API.

We use es_archiver to manage the data that our Cypress tests need.

1. Set up a clean instance of kibana and elasticsearch (if this is not possible, try to clean/minimize the data that you are going to archive).
2. With the kibana and elasticsearch instance up and running, create the data that you need for your test.
3. When you are sure that you have all the data you need run the following command from: `x-pack/test/security_solution_cypress`

```sh
node ../../../scripts/es_archiver save <nameOfTheFolderWhereDataIsSaved> <indexPatternsToBeSaved>  --dir ../../test/security_solution_cypress/es_archives --config ../../../test/functional/config.base.js --es-url http://<elasticsearchUsername>:<elasticsearchPassword>@<elasticsearchHost>:<elasticsearchPort>
```

Example:

```sh
node ../../../scripts/es_archiver save custom_rules ".kibana",".siem-signal*"  --dir ../../test/security_solution_cypress/es_archives --config ../../../test/functional/config.base.js --es-url http://elastic:changeme@localhost:9220
```

Note that the command will create the folder if it does not exist.

### Using an archive from within the Cypress tests

Task [cypress/support/es_archiver.ts](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/test/security_solution_cypress/cypress/support/es_archiver.ts) provides helpers such as `esArchiverLoad` and `esArchiverUnload` by means of `es_archiver`'s CLI.

## Serverless

Note that we use tags in order to select which tests we want to execute, if you want a test to be executed on serverless you need to add @serverless tag to it.


### Running the serverless tests locally

Run the tests with the following yarn scripts from `x-pack/test/security_solution_cypress`:

| Script Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| cypress:open:serverless | Opens the Cypress UI with all tests in the `e2e` directory. This also runs a mocked serverless environment. The kibana instance will reload when you make code changes. This is the recommended way to debug and develop tests. |
| cypress:run:serverless | Runs all tests tagged as SERVERLESS in the `e2e` directory excluding `investigations` and `explore` directories in headless mode |
| cypress:investigations:run:serverless | Runs all tests tagged as SERVERLESS in the `e2e/investigations` directory in headless mode |
| cypress:explore:run:serverless | Runs all tests tagged as SERVERLESS in the `e2e/explore` directory in headless mode |

Please note that all the headless mode commands do not open the Cypress UI and are typically used in CI/CD environments. The scripts that open the Cypress UI are useful for development and debugging.

### PLIs
When running serverless Cypress tests, the following PLIs are set by default:

```
      { product_line: 'security', product_tier: 'complete' },
      { product_line: 'endpoint', product_tier: 'complete' },
      { product_line: 'cloud', product_tier: 'complete' },
```

With the above configuration we'll be able to cover most of the scenarios, but there are some cases were we might want to use a different configuration. In that case, we just need to pass to the header of the test, which is the configuration we want for it.

```typescript
describe(
  'Entity Analytics Dashboard in Serverless',
  {
    tags: '@serverless',
    env: {
      ftrConfig: {
        productTypes: [
          { product_line: 'security', product_tier: 'essentials' },
          { product_line: 'endpoint', product_tier: 'essentials' },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
```

Per the way we set the environment during the execution process on CI, the above configuration is going to be valid when the test is executed on headless mode.

For test developing or test debugging purposes, you need to modify the configuration but without committing and pushing the changes in `x-pack/test/security_solution_cypress/serverless_config.ts`.

## Development Best Practices

Below you will a set of best practices that should be followed when writing Cypress tests.

### For serverless
Reuse just those tests that have the SAME exact behaviour and steps. Take the necessity of adding a conditional to the test to make it pass in order to, perform a different set of steps, setup, or assertions, as a signal for the need of a serverless 
specific test.

### Avoid forced actions

Cypress action commands like `click()`, `type()` and etc allow to pass `force` flag which is set to `false` by default. Avoid passing the `force` flag as it leads to swallowing some UI bugs. If it's impossible to perform an action without forcing it make sure to add an explanation comment and create a ticket to don't forget to fix it later on. The same is applicable to adding an extra `click()` before `type()` command. `type()` clicks an input once and types after so an extra `click()` usually means there is a problem.

### Write easy to maintain tests

Consider to extract all the elements you need to interact with to the `screens` folder. In this way in case the locator changes, we just need to update the value in one place.

### Write easy to read tests

Consider to extract all the tasks a user should perfom into the `tasks` folder. In this way is going to be easier to undertsand what are we trying to mimic from the user perspective. Also in case there is change on the way the user has to perform the action, we just need to update the value in one place.

### Make sure your test fails

Before open a PR with a new test, please first make sure that the test fails. If you never see your test fail you don’t know if your test is actually testing the right thing, or testing anything at all.

### Minimize the use of es_archive

When possible, create all the data that you need for executing the tests using the application APIS or the UI.

### Speed up test execution time

Loading the web page takes a big amount of time, in order to minimize that impact, the following points should be
taken into consideration until another solution is implemented:

- Group the tests that are similar in different contexts.
- For every context login only once, clean the state between tests if needed without re-loading the page.
- All tests in a spec file must be order-independent.
- Clean up the state and data just when needed using `cleanKibana` function. Executing this function takes a lot of time, so consider if you really need to clean the data before the execution. I.e: If you are just checking that a modal can be opened, you may not need to clean the data.

Remember that minimizing the number of times the web page is loaded, we minimize as well the execution time.

## Test Artifacts

When Cypress tests are run headless on the command line, artifacts
are generated under the `target` directory in the root of Kibana as follows:

- HTML Reports
  - location: `target/kibana-security-solution/cypress/results/output.html`
- `junit` Reports
  - location: `target/kibana-security-solution/cypress/results`
- Screenshots (of failed tests)
  - location: `target/kibana-security-solution/cypress/screenshots`
- Videos
  - disabled by default, can be enabled by setting env var `CYPRESS_video=true`
  - location: `target/kibana-security-solution/cypress/videos`

## Linting

Optional linting rules for Cypress and linting setup can be found [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/eslint-plugin-cypress#usage)
