  type: group
  release: ga
  fields:
  - name: cores
    type: long
    description: |
      The number of CPU cores present on the host. The non-normalized percentages will have a maximum value of `100% * cores`. The normalized percentages already take this value into account and have a maximum value of 100%.
  - name: user.pct
    type: scaled_float
    format: percent
    description: |
      The percentage of CPU time spent in user space. On multi-core systems, you can have percentages that are greater than 100%. For example, if 3 cores are at 60% use, then the `system.cpu.user.pct` will be 180%.
