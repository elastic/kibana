 * This file tests the situation when a reporting index spans releases. By default reporting indexes are created
 * on a weekly basis, but this is configurable so it is possible a user has this set to yearly. In that event, it
 * is possible report data is getting posted to an index that was created by a very old version. We don't have a
 * reporting index migration plan, so this test is important to ensure BWC, or that in the event we decide to make
 * a major change in a major release, we handle it properly.
