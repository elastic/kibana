# This Vagrantfile exists to define a virtual machine running MIT's Kerberos 5
# for usage as a testing fixture for the build process.
#
# In order to connect to the KDC process on this virtual machine, find and use
# the rendered krb5.conf file in the build output directory (build/conf).
#
# In order to provision principals in the KDC, use the provided addprinc.sh
# script with vagrant's ssh facility:
#
#    vagrant ssh -c /vagrant/src/main/resources/provision/addprinc.sh principal
#
# You will find the newly created principal's keytab file in the build output
# directory (build/keytabs). Principal creation is idempotent, and will recopy
# existing user keytabs from the KDC if they already exist.
