# Embedded Observability exploratory view example

To run this example plugin, use the command `yarn start --run-examples`.

This example shows how to embed Exploratory view into other observability solution applications. Using the exploratory view `EmbeddableComponent` of the `observability` start plugin,
you can pass in a valid Exploratory view series attributes which will get rendered the same way exploratory view works using Lens Embeddable. Updating the
configuration will reload the embedded visualization.
