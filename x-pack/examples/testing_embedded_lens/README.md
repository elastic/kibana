# Embedded Lens testing playground

To run this example plugin, use the command `yarn start --run-examples`.

This example is useful to test Lens embeddable. Using the `EmbeddableComponent` of the `lens` start plugin,
you can pass in a valid Lens configuration which will get rendered the same way Lens dashboard panels work. Updating the
configuration will reload the embedded visualization.
