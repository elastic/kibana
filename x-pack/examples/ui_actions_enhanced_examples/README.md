## Drilldown examples

This plugin holds few examples on how to add drilldown types to dashboard.

how a drilldown can be built, all in one file.

### `dashboard_to_url_drilldown`

`dashboard_to_url_drilldown` is a good starting point for build a drilldown
that navigates somewhere externally.

### `dashboard_to_discover_drilldown`

`dashboard_to_discover_drilldown` shows how a real-world drilldown could look like.
