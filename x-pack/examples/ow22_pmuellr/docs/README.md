# on-week 2022@1 - Patrick Mueller

Some mini-projects I worked on, all lumped together to cut down on
boilerplate, and because there are some structural similarities between
things here, like routes and rule types.

- [SQL Alerting Rule](sql_alerting_rule.md)
  
  alerting rule type that searches via a SQL query parameter

- [V8 Profiler](v8_profiler.md)
  
  http endpoints to run a CPU profiler or generate a heap snapshot

- [Webhook Alerting Rule](webhook_alerting_rule.md)
  
  alerting rule whose executor calls a webhook for alert status

- [esmev - Elasticsearch Mappings Everywhere!](esmev.md)
  
  es mappings are source of truth; what can we use them for?

- [Task Grapher](task_grapher.md)
  
  _ran out of time on this one.  next on-week!_

  come up with ways of graphing task execution on a timeline
