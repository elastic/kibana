# Task Grapher 

_part of [on-week 2022@1 - Patrick Mueller](./README.md)_

Looking for some visualizations of task activity over time, but most likely
looking purely at alerting rules / connectors, since they have good timing
info in the event log, but there is not really anything for task manager.

_didn't make the cut, **this** On-Week :-)_
