# Screenshotting Example

Screenshotting integration example plugin.

This plugin demonstrates the usage of the screenshotting plugin capabilities. The interaction happens on the backend via an API endpoint exposed by the plugin.

The plugin provides a way to input an expression on the front-end side. The expression will be rendered by an internal screenshotting application in Chromium on the backend.

To run this example, use the following command:

```bash
$ yarn start --run-examples
```
