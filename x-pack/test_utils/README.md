# Testbed utils

The Testbed is a small library to help testing React components. It is most usefull when testing application "sections" (or pages) in **integration** 
than when unit testing single components in isolation.

## Motivation

We dediced (the Elasticsearch UI team) to build this small abstraction to help with our "client integration" testing. When testing complete "pages" 
we get to test our application in a way that is closer to how a user would interact with it in a browser. It also gives us more confidence in 
our tests and avoids testing implementation details. 

We test everything up to the HTTP Requests made from the client to the Node.js API server. Those requets need to be mocked. This means that with a good 
**API integration test** coverage of those  endpoints, we can reduce the functional tests to a minium.

With this in mind, we needed a way to easily mount a component on a React Router `<Route>` (this component could possibily have _child_ routes and 
need access to the browser URL parameters and query params). In order to solve that, the Testbed wraps the component around a `MemoryRouter`.

On the other side, the majority of our current applications use Redux as state management so we needed a simple way to wrap our component under test 
inside a redux store provider.

## How to use it

At the top of your test file (you only need to declare it once), register a new Testbed by providing a React Component an an optional configuration object. 
You receive in return a function that you need to call to mount the component in your test.

**Example 1**

```ts
// remote_clusters_list.helpers.ts

import { registerTestBed } from '../../../../test_utils';
import { RemoteClusterList } from '../../app/sections/remote_cluster_list';
import { remoteClustersStore } from '../../app/store';
import routing from '../../app/services/routing';

const config = {
  memoryRouter: {
    onRouter(router) {
      routing.registerRouter(router); // send the router instance to the routing service
    },
    initialEntries: ['/some-resource-name'], // the Router initial URL
    componentRoutePath: '/:name' // the Component <Route /> path
  },
  store: remoteClusterStore
};

export const setup = registerTestBed(RemoteClusterList, config);
```

Once you have registered a TestBed, you can call the `setup()` function to mount the component in your tests. You will get an object 
back with a set of utility methods to test the component (refer to the documentation below for a complete list of the methods available).

```ts
// remote_cluster.test.ts

import { setup } from './remote_clusters_list.helpers.ts';

describe('<RemoteClusterList />', () => {
  test('it should have a table with 3 rows', () => {
    const { component, exists, find } = setup();

    // component is an Enzyme reactWrapper
    console.log(component.debug());
  
    expect(exists('remoteClusterTable')).toBe(true);
    expect(find('remoteClusterTable.row').length).toBe(3);
  });
});
```

## Chrome extension

There is a small Chrome extension that you can install in order to track the test subject on the current page. As it is meant to be used 
during development, the extension is only active when navigating a `localhost` URL.

You will find the "Test subjects finder" extension in the `x-pack/test_utils/chrome_extension` folder. In order to install it, simply open the
"extensions" window in Chrome then drag and drop the `test_subjects_finder.crx` file on the window.

You can specify a DOM node (the tree "root") from which the test subjects will be found. If you don't specify any, the document `<body>` 
will be used. The output format can either be `Typescript` (to export a string union type) or `List`. If you use Typescript, 
the union type will give you autocomplete on the test subjects in your test, you just need to provide the union type when registring the Testbed.

```ts
// my_component.helpers.ts

type TestSubjects = 'addButton'
 | 'autoFollowPatternForm';

export const setup = registerTestBed<TestSubjects>(MyComponent);
```

## API

## `registerTestBed(Component [, testBedConfig])`

Instantiate a new TestBed to test a React component. The arguments it receives are

- `Component` (the React component to test)
- `testBedConfig` (optional). An optional Testbed configuration object.

**@returns** A function to instantiate and mount the component.

### `testBedConfig`

The `testBedConfig` has the following properties (all **optional**)

- `defaultProps` The default props to pass to the mounted component. Those props can be overriden when calling the `setup([props])` callback
- `memoryRouter` Configuration object for the react-router `MemoryRouter` with the following properties
  - `wrapComponent` Flag to provide or not a `MemoryRouter`. If set to `false`, there won't be any router and the component won't be added on a `<Route />`. (default: `true`)
  - `initialEntries` The React Router **initial entries** setting. (default: `['/']`. [see doc](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router/docs/api/MemoryRouter.md))
  - `initialIndex` The React Router **initial index** setting (default: `0`)
  - `componentRoutePath` The route **path** for the mounted component (default: `"/"`)
  - `onRouter` A callBack that will be called with the React Router instance when the component is mounted
- `store` An redux store. You can also provide a function that returns a store. (default: `null`)


## `setup([props])`

When registering a Testbed, you receive in return a setup function. This function accepts one optional argument:

- `props` (optional) Props to pass to the mounted component.

```js
describe('<RemoteClusterList />', () => {
  test('it should be green', () => {
    // Will mount <RemoteClusterList color="green" />
    const { component } = setup({ color: 'green' });
    ...
  });
});
```

**@returns** An object with the following **properties** and **helpers** for the testing

#### `component`

The mounted component. It is an enzyme **reactWrapper**.

#### `exists(testSubject)`

Pass it a `data-test-subj` and it will return true if it exists or false if it does not exist. You can provide a nested path to access the
test subject by separating the parent and child with a dot (e.g. `myForm.followerIndexName`).

```js
const { exists } = setup();
expect(exists('myTestSubject')).toBe(true);
```

#### `find(testDataSubject)`

Pass it a `test-data-subj` and it will return an Enzyme reactWrapper of the node. You can provide a nested path to access the
test subject by separating the parent and child with a dot (e.g. `myForm.followerIndexName`).

```js
const { find } = setup();

const someNode = find('myTestSubject');
expect(someNode.text()).toBe('hello');
```

#### `setProps(props)`

Update the props passed to a component.

**Important**: This method can only be used on a Component that is _not_ wrapped by a `<Route />`.

```js
...

const { setup } = registerTestBed(RemoteClusterList);

describe('<RemoteClusterList />', () => {

  test('it should work', () => {
    const { exists, find, setProps } = setup();
    // test logic...

    // update the props of the component
    setProps({ color: 'yellow' });
    ...
  });
});
```

#### `table`

An object with the following methods:

##### `getMetaData(testSubject)`

Parse an EUI table and return meta data information about its rows and columns. You can provide a nested path to access the
test subject by separating the parent and child with a dot (e.g. `mySection.myTable`). It returns an object with two properties:

- `tableCellsValues` a two dimensional array of rows + columns with the text content of each cell of the table
- `rows` an array of row objects. A row object has the following two properties:
  - `reactWrapper` the Enzyme react wrapper of the `tr` element.
  - `columns` an array of columns objects. A column object has two properties:
    - `reactWrapper` the Enzyme react wrapper for the table row `td`
    - `value` the text content of the table cell

```html
<table data-test-subj="myTable">
  <tr>
    <td>Row 0, column 0</td>
    <td>Row 0, column 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, column 0</td>
    <td>Row 1, column 1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

```js
const {Â table: { getMetaData } } = setup();
const { tableCellsValues } = getMetaData('myTable');

expect(tableCellsValues).toEqual([
  ['Row 0, column 0'], ['Row 0, column 1'],
  ['Row 1, column 0'], ['Row 1, column 1'],
]);
```

#### `form`

An object with the following methods:

##### `setInputValue(input, value, isAsync)`

Set the value of a form input. The input can either be a test subject (a string) or an Enzyme react wrapper. If you specify a test subject, 
you can provide a nested path to access it by separating the parent and child with a dot (e.g. `myForm.followerIndexName`).

`isAsync`: flag that will return a Promise that resolves on the next "tick". This is useful if updating the input triggers 
an async operation (like a HTTP request) and we need it to resolve so the DOM gets updated (default: `false`).

```js
await form.setInputValue('myInput', 'some value', true);
```

##### `selectCheckBox(testSubject)`

Select a form checkbox.

##### `toggleEuiSwitch(testSubject)`

Toggle an Eui Switch.

##### `setComboBoxValue(testSubject, value)`

The EUI `<EuiComboBox />` component is special in the sense that it needs the keyboard ENTER key to be pressed
in order to register the value provided. This helper takes care of that.

##### `getErrorsMessages()`

Find all the DOM nodes with the `.euiFormErrorText` css class from EUI and return an Array with its text content.
