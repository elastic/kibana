If set to `true`, the analysis will automatically find correlations between metrics for a given by field value and report anomalies when those correlations cease to hold. For example, suppose CPU and memory usage on host A is usually highly correlated with the same metrics on host B. Perhaps this correlation occurs because they are running a load-balanced application. If you enable this property, anomalies will be reported when, for example, CPU usage on host A is high and the value of CPU usage on host B is low. That is to say, you’ll see an anomaly when the CPU of host A is unusual given the CPU of host B. To use the `multivariate_by_fields` property, you must also specify `by_field_name` in your detector."

The minimum valid value is 1 MiB. If you specify a value less than 1 MiB, an error occurs.
