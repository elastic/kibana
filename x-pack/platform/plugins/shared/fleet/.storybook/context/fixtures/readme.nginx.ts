export const readme = `# Nginx Integration

This integration periodically fetches metrics from [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) servers. It can parse access and error
logs created by the HTTP server.

## Compatibility

The Nginx \`stubstatus\` metrics was tested with Nginx 1.19.5 and are expected to work with all version >= 1.9.
The logs were tested with version 1.19.5.
On Windows, the module was tested with Nginx installed from the Chocolatey repository.

## Logs

**Timezone support**

This datasource parses logs that donâ€™t contain timezone information. For these logs, the Elastic Agent reads the local
timezone and uses it when parsing to convert the timestamp to UTC. The timezone to be used for parsing is included
in the event in the \`event.timezone\` field.

To disable this conversion, the event.timezone field can be removed with the drop_fields processor.

If logs are originated from systems or applications with a different timezone to the local one, the \`event.timezone\`
field can be overwritten with the original timezone using the add_fields processor.

### Access Logs

Access logs collects the nginx access logs.

An example event for \`access\` looks as following:

| url.domain                  | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the \`domain\` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by \`[\` and \`]\` (IETF RFC 2732), the \`[\` and \`]\` characters should also be captured in the \`domain\` field. | keyword          |
| url.extension               | The field contains the file extension from the original request url. The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension.

| url.original                | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not.                                                                                | keyword          |

## Metrics

### Stub Status Metrics

The Nginx \`stubstatus\` stream collects data from the Nginx \`ngx_http_stub_status\` module. It scrapes the server status
data from the web page generated by \`ngx_http_stub_status\`. Please verify that your Nginx distribution comes with the mentioned
module and it's enabled in the Nginx configuration file:

\`\`\`
location /nginx_status {
    stub_status;
    allow 127.0.0.1; # only allow requests from localhost
    deny all;        # deny all other hosts
}
\`\`\`

It's highly recommended to replace \`127.0.0.1\` with your serverâ€™s IP address and make sure that this page accessible to only you.

An example event for \`stubstatus\` looks as following:

\`\`\`json
