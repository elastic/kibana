# Fleet Diagrams

This directory contains diagrams for various components and concepts around the Fleet application. Diagrams are created using https://excalidraw.com/. To edit a diagram, open the `.excalidraw` file in the Excalidraw web application, then save the file and overwrite that same `.excalidraw` file. Also, be sure to export your diagram as a `.png` and update the image version of the diagram you're editing. 

Excalidraw is an open source diagramming tool for creating simple, effective diagrams and illustrations. To learn more about it, check out their GitHub repository: https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw.
