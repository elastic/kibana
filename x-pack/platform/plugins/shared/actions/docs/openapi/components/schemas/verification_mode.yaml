title: Verification mode
type: string
enum:
  - certificate
  - full
  - none
default: full
description: >
  Controls the verification of certificates.
  Use `full` to validate that the certificate has an issue date within the `not_before` and `not_after` dates, chains to a trusted certificate authority (CA), and has a hostname or IP address that matches the names within the certificate.
  Use `certificate` to validate the certificate and verify that it is signed by a trusted authority; this option does not check the certificate hostname.
  Use `none` to skip certificate validation.
