 * Resolves the `owner/repo` repository identifier for a code index by reading
 * the `repository` keyword field that Semantic Code Search stamps onto every
 * indexed chunk. This is preferred over parsing the index name, which can be
 * customized at index time and is therefore not a reliable source.
 *
 * The repository identifier is what the SCS git-history workflows
 * (`code-history-*`) filter on. Returns `undefined` when the field is absent
 * (e.g. an index created by an older SCS version) or on any read error, in
 * which case the git-history grounding tools are simply not exposed.
