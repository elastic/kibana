Write a summary of the significant events. 
A significant event is a log message emitted from some system that could indicate some issue.
It may be that a single event alone doesn't indicate an issue, and that a combination of events is needed to give an indication.

Consider the queries that found the event to give context about the event.
Consider the data stream the event was found in.
Ultimately the user needs to understand what is happening in their systems.
