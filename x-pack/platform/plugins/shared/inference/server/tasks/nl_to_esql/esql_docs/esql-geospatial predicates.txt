# GEOSPATIAL PREDICATES

Geospatial predicates are used to perform spatial operations and comparisons between geometric objects, such as points, shapes, and geo-grids. These commands allow you to compute distances, check for intersections, containment, and spatial relationships between geometries.

## Syntax

`ST_DISTANCE(geomA, geomB)`
`ST_INTERSECTS(geomA, geomB)`
`ST_DISJOINT(geomA, geomB)`
`ST_CONTAINS(geomA, geomB)`
`ST_WITHIN(geomA, geomB)`

### Parameters

#### geomA

Expression representing a geometry. Supported types include `geo_point`, `cartesian_point`, `geo_shape`, `cartesian_shape`, or geo-grid values such as `geohash`, `geotile`, `geohex` (for ST_INTERSECTS and ST_DISJOINT). If `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### geomB

Expression representing a geometry. Supported types include `geo_point`, `cartesian_point`, `geo_shape`, `cartesian_shape`, or geo-grid values such as `geohash`, `geotile`, `geohex` (for ST_INTERSECTS and ST_DISJOINT). If `null`, the function returns `null`. The coordinate system of `geomB` must match that of `geomA`; mixing `geo_*` and `cartesian_*` types is not allowed.

## Examples

Calculate the distance between two points:

Find the distance between the airport's location and its city location for the airport with abbreviation "CPH", and display relevant fields along with the computed distance.

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE abbrev == "CPH"
| EVAL distance = ST_DISTANCE(location, city_location)
| KEEP abbrev, name, location, city_location, distance
```

Check if a location intersects with a polygon:

Filter airports whose location intersects with a specified polygon geometry.

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE ST_INTERSECTS(location, TO_GEOSHAPE("POLYGON((42 14, 43 14, 43 15, 42 15, 42 14))"))
```

Determine if two geometries are disjoint:

Select airport city boundaries that do not overlap with a given polygon, and show key identifying fields.

```esql
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE ST_DISJOINT(city_boundary, TO_GEOSHAPE("POLYGON((-10 -60, 120 -60, 120 60, -10 60, -10 -60))"))
| KEEP abbrev, airport, region, city, city_location
```

Check if a boundary contains a polygon:

Return airport city boundaries that fully contain a specified polygon, including relevant airport and city details.

```esql
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE ST_CONTAINS(city_boundary, TO_GEOSHAPE("POLYGON((109.35 18.3, 109.45 18.3, 109.45 18.4, 109.35 18.4, 109.35 18.3))"))
| KEEP abbrev, airport, region, city, city_location
```

Check if a boundary is within a polygon:

Show airport city boundaries that are entirely within a given polygon, along with associated airport and city information.

```esql
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE ST_WITHIN(city_boundary, TO_GEOSHAPE("POLYGON((109.1 18.15, 109.6 18.15, 109.6 18.65, 109.1 18.65, 109.1 18.15))"))
| KEEP abbrev, airport, region, city, city_location
```
