## RENAME

The `RENAME` command is used to rename one or more columns in a table. If a column with the new name already exists, it will be replaced by the renamed column.

## Syntax

`RENAME old_name1 AS new_name1[, ..., old_nameN AS new_nameN]`

### Parameters

#### `old_nameX`

The name of the column you want to rename.

#### `new_nameX`

The new name for the column. If it conflicts with an existing column name, the existing column is dropped. If multiple columns are renamed to the same name, all but the rightmost column with the same new name are dropped.

## Examples

### Rename a single column

Rename the `still_hired` column to `employed`:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, still_hired
| RENAME still_hired AS employed
```

### Rename multiple columns

Rename `first_name` to `fn` and `last_name` to `ln` in a single command:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name
| RENAME first_name AS fn, last_name AS ln
```
