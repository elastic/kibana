# SUFFIX OPERATORS

The `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators are used to check whether a column contains NULL values or not.

## Syntax

`<column> IS NULL`

`<column> IS NOT NULL`

### Parameters

#### column

The column to be checked for NULL values.

## Examples

This query retrieves all employees whose `birth_date` field is NULL, meaning their birth date information is missing.

```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE birth_date IS NULL
```

This query finds all employees where the `is_rehired` field is not NULL (i.e., the field contains a value), and then counts the number of employee numbers in that group.

```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE is_rehired IS NOT NULL
| STATS COUNT(emp_no)
```
