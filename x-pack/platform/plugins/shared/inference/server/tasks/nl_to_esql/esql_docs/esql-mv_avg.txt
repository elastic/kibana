# MV_AVG

The MV_AVG function converts a multivalued field into a single value containing the average of all its values.

## Syntax

`MV_AVG(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

A multivalue expression to be averaged.

## Examples

Calculate the average of the values in a multivalued field:

This query creates a row with a multivalued field `a` containing the values `[3, 5, 1, 6]`, then calculates the average of those values and stores the result in a new field called `avg_a`.

```esql
ROW a=[3, 5, 1, 6]
| EVAL avg_a = MV_AVG(a)
```
