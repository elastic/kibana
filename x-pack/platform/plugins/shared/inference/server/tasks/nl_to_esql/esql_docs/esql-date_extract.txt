## Examples

The following query creates a row with a date value parsed from the string "2022-05-06", then extracts the year from that date and stores it in a new column called `year`:

```esql
ROW date = DATE_PARSE("yyyy-MM-dd", "2022-05-06")
| EVAL year = DATE_EXTRACT("year", date)
```

The following query retrieves all records from the `sample_data` index where the event timestamp is either before 9 AM or at or after 5 PM, effectively finding events that occurred outside of typical business hours:

```esql
FROM sample_data
| WHERE DATE_EXTRACT("hour_of_day", @timestamp) < 9
    AND DATE_EXTRACT("hour_of_day", @timestamp) >= 17
```
