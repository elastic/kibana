# GEOMETRY FUNCTIONS

Geometry functions provide tools to extract coordinates, count points, and simplify geometries. These functions work with geographic and cartesian point and shape types.

## Syntax

`ST_X(point)`  
`ST_Y(point)`  
`ST_NPOINTS(geometry)`  
`ST_SIMPLIFY(geometry, tolerance)`

### Parameters

#### point

Expression of type `geo_point` or `cartesian_point`. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### geometry

Expression of type `geo_point`, `geo_shape`, `cartesian_point`, or `cartesian_shape`. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### tolerance

(Optional) Tolerance for geometry simplification, in the units of the input spatial reference system (SRS).

## Examples

Extract the x and y coordinates from a geo point:

```esql
ROW point = TO_GEOPOINT("POINT(42.97109629958868 14.7552534006536)")
| EVAL x = ST_X(point), y = ST_Y(point)
```
Extracts the longitude and latitude values from a geo point and assigns them to the fields `x` and `y`.

Count the number of points in a city boundary geometry:

```esql
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE abbrev == "CPH"
| EVAL points = ST_NPOINTS(city_boundary)
| KEEP abbrev, airport, points
```
Retrieves the airport city boundary for "CPH", counts the number of points in its geometry, and displays the abbreviation, airport name, and point count.

Simplify a polygon geometry using a specified tolerance:

```esql
ROW wkt = "POLYGON ((7.998 53.827, 9.470 53.068, 15.754 53.801, 16.523 57.160, 11.162 57.868, 8.064 57.445, 6.219 55.317, 7.998 53.827))"
| EVAL simplified = ST_SIMPLIFY(TO_GEOSHAPE(wkt), 0.7)
```
Converts a WKT polygon to a geo shape and simplifies its geometry using a tolerance of 0.7.

## Limitations

- The result of `ST_SIMPLIFY` may be an invalid geometry, even if the original input was valid.
