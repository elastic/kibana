# CONCAT

The CONCAT function joins two or more strings together.

## Syntax

`CONCAT(string1, string2)`

### Parameters

#### string1

The first string to concatenate.

#### string2

The second string to concatenate.

## Examples

This query selects the `first_name` and `last_name` columns from the `employees` data, then creates a new column called `fullname` by joining the `first_name` and `last_name` values with a space in between.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name
| EVAL fullname = CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name)
```

This example creates a `fullname` column by joining the `first_name` and `last_name` columns with a space in between.
