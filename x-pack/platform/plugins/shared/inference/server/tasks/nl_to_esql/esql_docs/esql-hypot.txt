# HYPOT

The HYPOT function is used to calculate the hypotenuse of two numbers. 

## Syntax

`HYPOT(number1, number2)`

### Parameters

#### number1

This is a numeric value. If it's `null`, the function will also return `null`.

#### number2

This is also a numeric value. If it's `null`, the function will also return `null`.

## Examples

Check the hypotenuse of two variables through the following example:

```esql
ROW a = 3.0, b = 4.0
| EVAL c = HYPOT(a, b)
```

Note that the HYPOT function returns the hypotenuse in double data type. Besides, if any of the numbers is infinity, the hypotenuse returns `null`.
