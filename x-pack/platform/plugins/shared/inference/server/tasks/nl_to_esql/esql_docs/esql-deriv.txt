# DERIV

Calculates the derivative over time of a numeric field using linear regression.

## Syntax

`DERIV(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the derivative for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the derivative.

## Examples

The following query calculates the maximum rate of change (derivative) of the `network.cost` field for each 5-minute time bucket and pod named "three". It first selects data from the `datenanos-k8s` source, filters for records where the pod is "three", computes the derivative of `network.cost`, finds the maximum derivative value within each 5-minute interval and pod, and groups the results accordingly.

```esql
TS datenanos-k8s
| WHERE pod == "three"
| STATS max_deriv = MAX(DERIV(network.cost)) BY time_bucket = BUCKET(@timestamp,5minute), pod
```
