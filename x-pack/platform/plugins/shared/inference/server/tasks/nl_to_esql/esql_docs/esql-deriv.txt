# DERIV

Calculates the derivative over time of a numeric field using linear regression.

## Syntax

`DERIV(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the derivative for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the derivative.

## Examples

Calculates the maximum rate of change in `network.cost` for each 5-minute interval and for the pod named "three".

```esql
TS datenanos-k8s
| WHERE pod == "three"
| STATS max_deriv = MAX(DERIV(network.cost)) BY time_bucket = BUCKET(@timestamp,5minute), pod
```
