# SUM_OVER_TIME

Calculates the sum of a field's values over a specified time window.

## Syntax

`SUM_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the sum for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the sum.

## Examples

The following query calculates the total network cost over time, grouping the results by cluster and by 1-minute time intervals. It uses the `SUM_OVER_TIME` function to sum the `network.cost` field within each time window, then aggregates these sums for each cluster and time bucket.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS sum_cost=SUM(SUM_OVER_TIME(network.cost)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(1minute)
```
