# INCREASE

Calculates the absolute increase of a counter field within a specified time window.

## Syntax

`INCREASE(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the increase for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the increase.

## Examples

The following query calculates the increase in total network bytes received (`network.total_bytes_in`) for each cluster and 10-minute time bucket, but only for pods named "one". It first filters the data to include only the relevant pod, then computes the sum of the increase in bytes for each cluster and time interval.

```esql
TS k8s
| WHERE pod == "one"
| STATS increase_bytes_in = SUM(INCREASE(network.total_bytes_in)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(10minute)
```
