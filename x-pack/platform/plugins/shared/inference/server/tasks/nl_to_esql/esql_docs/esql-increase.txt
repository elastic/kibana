# INCREASE

Calculates the absolute increase of a counter field within a specified time window.

## Syntax

`INCREASE(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field for which to calculate the increase.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the increase.

## Examples

The following query calculates the increase in network bytes in for each cluster and 10-minute time bucket:

```esql
TS k8s
| WHERE pod == "one"
| STATS increase_bytes_in = SUM(INCREASE(network.total_bytes_in)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(10minute)
```

This query retrieves time series data from the `k8s` source, filters for records where the pod name is "one", and then, for each cluster and 10-minute time bucket, calculates the total increase in the `network.total_bytes_in` counter. The result shows the sum of increases in network bytes in for each cluster within each 10-minute interval.
