# MATCH_PHRASE

Use `MATCH_PHRASE` to perform a `match_phrase` on the specified field. Using `MATCH_PHRASE` is equivalent to using the `match_phrase` query in the Elasticsearch Query DSL.
MatchPhrase can be used on text fields, as well as other field types like keyword, boolean, or date types.
MatchPhrase is not supported for semantic_text or numeric types.
MatchPhrase can use function named parameters to specify additional options for the
match_phrase query.
All `match_phrase` query parameters are supported.
`MATCH_PHRASE` returns true if the provided query matches the row.

```
stack: ga 9.1.0
```

**Syntax**
`MATCH_PHRASE(field, query, options, zero_terms_query, boost, analyzer, slop)`

### Parameters

#### `field`

Field that the query will target.

#### `query`

Value to find in the provided field.

#### `options`

(Optional) MatchPhrase additional options as function named parameters. See `match_phrase` for more information.

**Supported types**

**Supported function named parameters**
### Parameters

#### `zero_terms_query`

(keyword) Indicates whether all documents or none are returned if the analyzer removes all tokens, such as when using a stop filter. Defaults to none.

#### `boost`

(float) Floating point number used to decrease or increase the relevance scores of the query. Defaults to 1.0.

#### `analyzer`

(keyword) Analyzer used to convert the text in the query value into token. Defaults to the index-time analyzer mapped for the field. If no analyzer is mapped, the index’s default analyzer is used.
