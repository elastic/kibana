# MATCH_PHRASE

The MATCH_PHRASE function performs a phrase match on the specified field, similar to the `match_phrase` query in the Query DSL. It can be used on text fields as well as keyword, boolean, or date types, but is not supported for semantic_text or numeric types. MATCH_PHRASE supports all `match_phrase` query parameters and allows the use of function named parameters for additional options. The function returns true if the provided query matches the row.

## Syntax

`MATCH_PHRASE(field, query, options, zero_terms_query, boost, analyzer, slop)`

### Parameters

#### field

The field that the query will target.

#### query

The value to find in the provided field.

#### options

(Optional) Additional options for the match_phrase query, specified as function named parameters. See `match_phrase` for more information.

#### zero_terms_query

(Optional) Indicates whether all documents or none are returned if the analyzer removes all tokens, such as when using a stop filter. Defaults to none.

#### boost

(Optional) Floating point number used to decrease or increase the relevance scores of the query. Defaults to 1.0.

#### analyzer

(Optional) Analyzer used to convert the text in the query value into tokens. Defaults to the index-time analyzer mapped for the field, or the index’s default analyzer if none is mapped.

#### slop

(Optional) Maximum number of positions allowed between matching tokens. Defaults to 0. Transposed terms have a slop of 2.

## Examples

This query retrieves all rows from the `books` index where the `author` field contains the exact phrase "William Faulkner".

```esql
FROM books
| WHERE MATCH_PHRASE(author, "William Faulkner")
```
