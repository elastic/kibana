# FORK

The FORK command creates multiple execution branches that operate on the same input data and combines their results into a single output table. A discriminator column called `_fork` is added to identify the branch each row originated from. This command is useful for running different processing pipelines in parallel and merging their results.

## Syntax

`FORK ( <processing_commands> ) ( <processing_commands> ) ... ( <processing_commands> )`

### Parameters

#### <processing_commands>

A sequence of processing commands to be executed as a branch. Each set of commands is enclosed in parentheses and operates on the same input data.

## Examples

In this example, each FORK branch returns one row. The `_fork` column indicates the originating branch for each row:

Selects employees with employee numbers 10001 and 10002 in separate branches, merges the results, and displays the employee number along with the branch identifier.

```esql
FROM employees
| FORK ( WHERE emp_no == 10001 )
       ( WHERE emp_no == 10002 )
| KEEP emp_no, _fork
| SORT emp_no
```

## Limitations

- FORK supports a maximum of 8 execution branches.
- In versions older than 9.3.0, using remote cluster references with FORK is not supported.
- Using more than one FORK command in a single query is not supported.
- If no `LIMIT` is provided in a branch, FORK defaults to `LIMIT 1000` per branch.
