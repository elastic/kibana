# FORK

The FORK command creates multiple execution branches that operate on the same input data and combines their results into a single output table. A discriminator column named `_fork` is added to indicate which branch each row originated from. This command is useful for hybrid search scenarios, especially when used together with the FUSE command to combine and score results from multiple queries.

## Syntax

`FORK ( <processing_commands> ) ( <processing_commands> ) ... ( <processing_commands> )`

### Parameters

#### <processing_commands>

A sequence of processing commands to apply in each branch. Each set of commands is enclosed in parentheses and operates independently on the same input data.

## Examples

In this example, each FORK branch returns one row. The `_fork` column indicates which branch each row comes from:

This query selects employees with `emp_no` 10001 and 10002 in separate branches, adds the `_fork` column to identify the branch, and keeps only the `emp_no` and `_fork` columns, sorting the results by `emp_no`.

```esql
FROM employees
| FORK ( WHERE emp_no == 10001 )
       ( WHERE emp_no == 10002 )
| KEEP emp_no, _fork
| SORT emp_no
```

## Limitations

- FORK supports a maximum of 8 execution branches.
- In versions older than 9.3.0, using remote cluster references with FORK is not supported.
- Using more than one FORK command in a query is not supported.
- FORK branches default to `LIMIT 1000` if no LIMIT is provided.
