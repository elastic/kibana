# ST_EXTENT_AGG

Calculates the spatial extent over a field with geometry type, returning a bounding box that encompasses all values of the field.

## Syntax

`ST_EXTENT_AGG(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The column containing geometry values to aggregate.

## Examples

The following query calculates the bounding box that contains all airport locations in India. It selects records from the `airports` dataset where the country is "India", then computes the spatial extent (bounding box) of the `location` field using `ST_EXTENT_AGG`.

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE country == "India"
| STATS extent = ST_EXTENT_AGG(location)
```
