# ST_EXTENT_AGG

Calculates the spatial extent over a field containing geometry data, returning a bounding box that encompasses all values in the field.

## Syntax

`ST_EXTENT_AGG(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The column containing geometry values to aggregate into a bounding box.

## Examples

Calculate the bounding box for all airport locations in India:

This query selects all records from the `airports` dataset where the `country` is "India", and then calculates the bounding box that contains all airport locations in India using the `ST_EXTENT_AGG` function.

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE country == "India"
| STATS extent = ST_EXTENT_AGG(location)
```
This example computes the spatial extent of the `location` field for airports in India, returning a bounding box that covers all matching locations.
