# MV_SLICE

The `MV_SLICE` function extracts a subset of a multivalued field based on specified start and end index values. It is particularly useful when working with functions that produce multivalued columns in a known order, such as `SPLIT` or `MV_SORT`.

## Syntax

`MV_SLICE(field, start, end)`

### Parameters

#### `field`

- A multivalue expression. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### `start`

- The starting position of the slice. If `null`, the function returns `null`.
- Can be negative, where `-1` refers to the last value in the list.

#### `end` (Optional)

- The ending position of the slice (inclusive). If omitted, only the value at the `start` position is returned.
- Can be negative, where `-1` refers to the last value in the list.

## Examples

Extracting specific slices from a multivalued field

```esql
ROW a = [1, 2, 2, 3]
| EVAL a1 = MV_SLICE(a, 1), a2 = MV_SLICE(a, 2, 3)
```

This example extracts:
- `a1` as the value starting at index `1` (second value in the list).
- `a2` as the values from index `2` to `3` (third and fourth values in the list).

Using negative indices to slice from the end of the list

```esql
ROW a = [1, 2, 2, 3]
| EVAL a1 = MV_SLICE(a, -2), a2 = MV_SLICE(a, -3, -1)
```

This example extracts:
- `a1` as the value starting at the second-to-last index (`-2`).
- `a2` as the values from the third-to-last index (`-3`) to the last index (`-1`).

## Notes

- The order in which multivalued fields are read from underlying storage is not guaranteed. While it is often ascending, this behavior should not be relied upon.
