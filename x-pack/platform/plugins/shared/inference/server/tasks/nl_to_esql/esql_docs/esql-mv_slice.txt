# MV_SLICE

The MV_SLICE function returns a subset of a multivalued field using specified start and end index values. This is especially useful when working with functions that produce multivalued columns in a known order, such as `SPLIT` or `MV_SORT`. The order in which multivalued fields are read from storage is not guaranteed and may frequently be ascending, but you should not rely on that.

## Syntax

`MV_SLICE(field, start, end)`

### Parameters

#### field

The multivalue expression to slice. If this parameter is `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### start

The start position for the slice. If this parameter is `null`, the function returns `null`. The start argument can be negative; an index of -1 refers to the last value in the list.

#### end

The end position (inclusive) for the slice. This parameter is optional; if omitted, only the value at the start position is returned. The end argument can be negative; an index of -1 refers to the last value in the list.

## Examples

The following query demonstrates how to extract specific values from a multivalued field. It creates a row with a field `a` containing the values `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, then uses `mv_slice` to extract the value at index 1 and the values from index 2 to 3.

```esql
row a = [1, 2, 2, 3]
| eval a1 = mv_slice(a, 1), a2 = mv_slice(a, 2, 3)
```

This query creates a row with a multivalued field `a` containing `[1, 2, 2, 3]`. It then extracts the value at index 1 (which is `2`) into `a1`, and the values from index 2 to 3 (which are `[2, 3]`) into `a2`.

The following query shows how to use negative indices to extract values from the end of a multivalued field. It creates a row with a field `a` containing `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, then uses `mv_slice` to extract the value at index -2 and the values from index -3 to -1.

```esql
row a = [1, 2, 2, 3]
| eval a1 = mv_slice(a, -2), a2 = mv_slice(a, -3, -1)
```

This query creates a row with a multivalued field `a` containing `[1, 2, 2, 3]`. It then extracts the value at index -2 (which is `2`) into `a1`, and the values from index -3 to -1 (which are `[2, 2, 3]`) into `a2`.
