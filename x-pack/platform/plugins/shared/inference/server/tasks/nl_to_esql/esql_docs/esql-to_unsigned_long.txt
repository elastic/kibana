# TO_UNSIGNED_LONG

Converts an input value to an unsigned long. If the input is a date type, its value is interpreted as milliseconds since the Unix epoch and converted to unsigned long. Boolean `true` is converted to `1`, and `false` to `0`.

## Syntax

`TO_UNSIGNED_LONG(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The input value to convert. This can be a single- or multi-valued column, or an expression.

## Examples

This example converts string representations of numbers to unsigned long values. If the conversion is not possible (as with `"foo"`), the result is `null` and a warning header is added to the response with details about the failure.

```esql
ROW str1 = "2147483648", str2 = "2147483648.2", str3 = "foo"
| EVAL long1 = TO_UNSIGNED_LONG(str1), long2 = TO_ULONG(str2), long3 = TO_UL(str3)
```
