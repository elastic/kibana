# TO_UNSIGNED_LONG

Converts an input value to an unsigned long value. If the input is a date type, its value is interpreted as milliseconds since the Unix epoch and converted to unsigned long. Boolean `true` is converted to `1`, and `false` to `0`.

## Syntax

`TO_UNSIGNED_LONG(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The input value to convert. This can be a single- or multi-valued column or an expression.

## Examples

Converts three string values to unsigned long, where valid numeric strings are converted successfully and a non-numeric string results in a null value with a warning.

```esql
ROW str1 = "2147483648", str2 = "2147483648.2", str3 = "foo"
| EVAL long1 = TO_UNSIGNED_LONG(str1), long2 = TO_ULONG(str2), long3 = TO_UL(str3)
```

Convert string values to unsigned long. The last conversion (`str3 = "foo"`) is not possible and results in a `null` value, with a warning header in the response indicating the failure and its reason.
