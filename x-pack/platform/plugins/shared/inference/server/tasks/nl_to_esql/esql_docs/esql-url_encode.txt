# URL_ENCODE

The URL_ENCODE function encodes a string for safe use in URLs by percent-encoding all characters except alphanumerics, `.`, `-`, `_`, and `~`. Spaces are encoded as `+`.

## Syntax

`URL_ENCODE(string)`

### Parameters

#### string

The URL or string to encode.

## Examples

Encode a URL containing spaces and special characters:

This query creates a row with a URL containing spaces and special characters, then encodes the URL so that spaces become `+` and special characters are percent-encoded for safe use in URLs.

```esql
ROW u = "https://example.com/?x=foo bar&y=baz" | EVAL u = URL_ENCODE(u)
```
This example encodes the URL, converting spaces to `+` and special characters to their percent-encoded form.
