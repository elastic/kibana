# TBUCKET

The TBUCKET function creates groups of values, known as buckets, from a `@timestamp` attribute. You must specify the size of each bucket directly, using a time duration or date period.

## Syntax

`TBUCKET(buckets)`

### Parameters

#### buckets

The desired bucket size. This must be provided as a time duration or date period, either directly or as a string (for example, `1 hour` or `"1 hour"`). The reference point for bucketing is the epoch, which starts at `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`.

## Examples

Provide a bucket size as an argument:

This query divides the `@timestamp` values in the `sample_data` source into 1-hour intervals (buckets). For each bucket, it calculates the earliest (`min`) and latest (`max`) timestamp, then sorts the results by the minimum timestamp in each bucket.

```esql
FROM sample_data
| STATS min = MIN(@timestamp), max = MAX(@timestamp) BY bucket = TBUCKET(1 hour)
| SORT min
```

Provide a string representation of bucket size as an argument:

This query performs the same operation as the previous example, but specifies the bucket size as a string ("1 hour"). It groups the `@timestamp` values into 1-hour buckets, calculates the minimum and maximum timestamp for each bucket, and sorts the results by the minimum timestamp.

```esql
FROM sample_data
| STATS min = MIN(@timestamp), max = MAX(@timestamp) BY bucket = TBUCKET("1 hour")
| SORT min
```

## Limitations

The reference for bucketing is the epoch, which starts at `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`. The bucket size must be a valid time duration or date period, either as a direct value or a string.
