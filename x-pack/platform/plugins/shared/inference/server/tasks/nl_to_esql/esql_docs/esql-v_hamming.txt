Calculates the Hamming distance between the `rgb_byte_vector` column and the vector `[0, 127, 127]`, assigns the result to a new column called `similarity`, and sorts the output by similarity in descending order and color in ascending order.

```esql
from colors
| eval similarity = v_hamming(rgb_byte_vector, [0, 127, 127])
| sort similarity desc, color asc
```
