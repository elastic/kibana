# V_HAMMING

Calculates the Hamming distance between two dense vectors.

## Syntax

`V_HAMMING(left, right)`

### Parameters

#### left

First dense_vector to use to calculate the Hamming distance.

#### right

Second dense_vector to use to calculate the Hamming distance.

## Examples

The following query calculates the Hamming distance between the `rgb_byte_vector` column and the vector `[0, 127, 127]` for each row in the `colors` table. It then creates a new column called `similarity` to store the result, and sorts the output by similarity in descending order and by color in ascending order.

```esql
from colors
| eval similarity = v_hamming(rgb_byte_vector, [0, 127, 127])
| sort similarity desc, color asc
```
