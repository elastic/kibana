# IDELTA

Calculates the idelta of a gauge, which is the absolute change between the last two data points. idelta only considers the last two data points in each time period, making it more responsive to recent changes compared to delta.

## Syntax

`IDELTA(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the value for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the idelta.

## Examples

The following query calculates the sum of the absolute change (idelta) in the `events_received` metric for each pod, grouped into 10-minute time buckets. This helps you see how much the number of events received by each pod has changed in each 10-minute interval, focusing on the most recent changes within each bucket.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS events = SUM(IDELTA(events_received)) by pod, time_bucket = TBUCKET(10minute)
```
