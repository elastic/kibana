# TO_INTEGER

Converts an input value to an integer. If the input is a date type, it is interpreted as milliseconds since the Unix epoch and converted to an integer. Boolean `true` is converted to `1`, and `false` to `0`. When two arguments are provided—a string value and a whole number base—the string is parsed as an integer in the specified base. If parsing fails, a warning is generated and the result is `null`. A leading '0x' prefix is allowed for base 16.

## Syntax

`TO_INTEGER(field, base)`

### Parameters

#### field

The input value to convert. This can be a single- or multi-valued column or an expression.

#### base

(Optional) The radix or base used to convert the input value. When a base is specified, the input type must be `keyword` or `text`.

## Examples

The following query converts each value in the multi-valued `long` field to an integer. If a value cannot be converted, the result is `null` and a warning is generated.

```esql
ROW long = [5013792, 2147483647, 501379200000]
| EVAL int = TO_INTEGER(long)
```

This query parses two string values as integers: `str1` is parsed as a base 16 (hexadecimal) integer, and `str2` is parsed as a base 13 integer. The resulting integer values are kept along with the original strings.

```esql
ROW str1 = "0x32", str2 = "31"
| EVAL int1 = TO_INTEGER(str1, 16), int2 = TO_INTEGER(str2, 13)
| KEEP str1, int1, str2, int2
```

This query attempts to parse the string `"Kona"` as an integer in base 27 (which succeeds) and in base 10 (which fails). If parsing fails, a warning is generated and the result is `null`.

```esql
ROW str1 = "Kona"
| EVAL int1 = TO_INTEGER(str1, 27), fail1 = TO_INTEGER(str1, 10)
```
