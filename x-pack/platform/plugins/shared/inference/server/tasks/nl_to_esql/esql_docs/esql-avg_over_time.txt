# AVG_OVER_TIME

Calculates the average value of a numeric field over a specified time window.

## Syntax

`AVG_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the average for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the average.

## Examples

The following query calculates the maximum average network cost per cluster in 1-minute time buckets. It first selects data from the `k8s` time series, then computes the average network cost over time using `AVG_OVER_TIME(network.cost)`, finds the maximum of these averages per cluster and per 1-minute time bucket, and returns the results grouped by cluster and time bucket.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS max_cost=MAX(AVG_OVER_TIME(network.cost)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(1minute)
```
