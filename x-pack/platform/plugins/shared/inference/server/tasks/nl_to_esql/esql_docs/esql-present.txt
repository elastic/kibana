# PRESENT

The PRESENT function returns true if the input expression yields any non-null values within the current aggregation context; otherwise, it returns false.

## Syntax

`PRESENT(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

Expression that outputs values to be checked for presence.

## Examples

Check if any non-null values exist in the `languages` field:

This query checks if there are any non-null values in the `languages` field across all documents in the `employees` index. It returns a single boolean value indicating whether at least one non-null value exists.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS is_present = PRESENT(languages)
```

Check for the presence of `salary` values within each `languages` group:

This query groups employees by their `languages` field and, for each group, determines if there are any non-null `salary` values. It returns a boolean for each language group indicating the presence of salary data.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS is_present = PRESENT(salary) BY languages
```

Return 1 if `languages` is present and 0 if not, for a specific employee:

This query filters for the employee with `emp_no` equal to 10020 and checks if the `languages` field is present (non-null) for that employee. It returns 1 if present, or 0 if not.

```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE emp_no == 10020
| STATS is_present = TO_INTEGER(PRESENT(languages))
```
