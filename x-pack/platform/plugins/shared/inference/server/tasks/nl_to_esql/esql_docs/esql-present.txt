# PRESENT

The PRESENT function returns true if the input expression yields any non-null values within the current aggregation context; otherwise, it returns false.

## Syntax

`PRESENT(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

Expression that outputs values to be checked for presence.

## Examples

This query checks if there are any non-null values in the `languages` field across all employees, and returns the result as `is_present`.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS is_present = PRESENT(languages)
```

This query checks, for each group of employees sharing the same `languages` value, whether there are any non-null `salary` values present in that group. The result is returned as `is_present` for each language group.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS is_present = PRESENT(salary) BY languages
```

This query filters for the employee with employee number 10020, then checks if there are any non-null values in the `languages` field for that employee. The result is converted to an integer: 1 if present, 0 if not.

```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE emp_no == 10020
| STATS is_present = TO_INTEGER(PRESENT(languages))
```
