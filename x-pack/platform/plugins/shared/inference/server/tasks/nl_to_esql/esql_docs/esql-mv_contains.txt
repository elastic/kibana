# MV_CONTAINS

Checks if all values yielded by the second multivalue expression are present in the values yielded by the first multivalue expression. Returns a boolean. Null values are treated as an empty set.

## Syntax

`MV_CONTAINS(superset, subset)`

### Parameters

#### superset

Multivalue expression that represents the set in which to check for the presence of all values from the subset.

#### subset

Multivalue expression containing the values to check for within the superset.

## Examples

Checks if the element "a" is present in the set ["a", "b", "c"].

```esql
ROW set = ["a", "b", "c"], element = "a"
| EVAL set_contains_element = mv_contains(set, element)
```

Checks if setA is a subset of setB and if setB is a subset of setA.

```esql
ROW setA = ["a","c"], setB = ["a", "b", "c"]
| EVAL a_subset_of_b = mv_contains(setB, setA)
| EVAL b_subset_of_a = mv_contains(setA, setB)
```

Filters airports where the "type" field contains both "major" and "military" and the scalerank is 9, then keeps the scalerank, name, and country columns.

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE mv_contains(type, ["major","military"]) AND scalerank == 9
| KEEP scalerank, name, country
```
