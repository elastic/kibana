# MV_CONTAINS

The MV_CONTAINS function checks if all values from the second multivalue expression are present in the values from the first multivalue expression. It returns a boolean result. Null values are treated as an empty set.

## Syntax

`MV_CONTAINS(superset, subset)`

### Parameters

#### superset

A multivalue expression representing the set in which to check for the presence of all values from the subset.

#### subset

A multivalue expression representing the set of values to check for within the superset.

## Examples

Check if a single element is present in a set:

This query creates a row with a set containing "a", "b", and "c", and an element "a". It then checks if the element "a" is present in the set, returning a boolean result in the `set_contains_element` field.

```esql
ROW set = ["a", "b", "c"], element = "a"
| EVAL set_contains_element = mv_contains(set, element)
```

Check if one set is a subset of another, and vice versa:

This query creates two sets, `setA` and `setB`. It checks if all elements of `setA` are present in `setB` (i.e., if `setA` is a subset of `setB`), and also checks if all elements of `setB` are present in `setA` (i.e., if `setB` is a subset of `setA`). The results are stored in `a_subset_of_b` and `b_subset_of_a` respectively.

```esql
ROW setA = ["a","c"], setB = ["a", "b", "c"]
| EVAL a_subset_of_b = mv_contains(setB, setA)
| EVAL b_subset_of_a = mv_contains(setA, setB)
```

Filter airports where the type contains both "major" and "military", and scalerank is 9:

This query retrieves records from the `airports` index where the `type` field contains both "major" and "military", and the `scalerank` field equals 9. It then keeps only the `scalerank`, `name`, and `country` fields in the output.

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE mv_contains(type, ["major","military"]) AND scalerank == 9
| KEEP scalerank, name, country
```
