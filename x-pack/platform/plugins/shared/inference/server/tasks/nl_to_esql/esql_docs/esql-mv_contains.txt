# MV_CONTAINS

Checks if all values produced by the second multivalue expression are present in the values produced by the first multivalue expression. Returns a boolean value. Null values are treated as an empty set.

## Syntax

`MV_CONTAINS(superset, subset)`

### Parameters

#### superset

A multivalue expression representing the set in which to check for the presence of all values from the subset.

#### subset

A multivalue expression representing the set of values to check for within the superset.

## Examples

Check if a set contains a specific element:

This query creates a row with a set containing "a", "b", and "c", and an element "a". It then checks if the element "a" is present in the set, returning a boolean result.

```esql
ROW set = ["a", "b", "c"], element = "a"
| EVAL set_contains_element = mv_contains(set, element)
```

Check if one set is a subset of another:

This query creates two sets, setA and setB, and evaluates whether all elements of setA are present in setB (i.e., setA is a subset of setB), and vice versa. It returns boolean results for both checks.

```esql
ROW setA = ["a","c"], setB = ["a", "b", "c"]
| EVAL a_subset_of_b = mv_contains(setB, setA)
| EVAL b_subset_of_a = mv_contains(setA, setB)
```

Filter rows where a column contains all specified values:

This query retrieves rows from the `airports` index where the `type` column contains both "major" and "military", and the `scalerank` is 9. It then keeps only the `scalerank`, `name`, and `country` columns in the output.

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE mv_contains(type, ["major","military"]) AND scalerank == 9
| KEEP scalerank, name, country
```
