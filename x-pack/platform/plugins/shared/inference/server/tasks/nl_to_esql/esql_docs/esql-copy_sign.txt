# COPY_SIGN

Returns a value with the magnitude of the first argument and the sign of the second argument. This function is similar to Java's Math.copySign(double magnitude, double sign) and IEEE 754's `copysign`.

## Syntax

`COPY_SIGN(magnitude, sign)`

### Parameters

#### magnitude

The expression providing the magnitude of the result. Must be a numeric type.

#### sign

The expression providing the sign of the result. Must be a numeric type.

## Examples

This query retrieves data from the `employees` index and creates a new field `cs1` for each record. The value of `cs1` is calculated by taking the magnitude of the `salary` field and applying the sign of the smallest value found in the `salary_change` field for that record.

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL cs1 = COPY_SIGN(salary, LEAST(salary_change))
```
