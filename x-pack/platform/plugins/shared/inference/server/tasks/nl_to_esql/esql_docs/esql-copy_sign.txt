# COPY_SIGN

Returns a value with the magnitude of the first argument and the sign of the second argument. This function is similar to Java's Math.copySign(double magnitude, double sign) and to `copysign` from IEEE 754.

## Syntax

`COPY_SIGN(magnitude, sign)`

### Parameters

#### magnitude

The expression providing the magnitude of the result. Must be a numeric type.

#### sign

The expression providing the sign of the result. Must be a numeric type.

## Examples

This query selects data from the `employees` index and creates a new column called `cs1`. For each row, `cs1` contains the value of `salary` but with its sign (positive or negative) set to match the sign of the smallest value in the `salary_change` field for that row.

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL cs1 = COPY_SIGN(salary, LEAST(salary_change))
```
This example creates a new column `cs1` where each value has the magnitude of `salary` and the sign of the smallest value in `salary_change` for each row.
