# TO_TIMEDURATION

The TO_TIMEDURATION function converts an input value into a `time_duration` value. The input must be a valid constant time duration expression.

## Syntax

`TO_TIMEDURATION(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The input value to convert. The value must be a valid constant time duration expression.

## Examples

Convert a string representing a time duration into a `time_duration` value and use it in date arithmetic:

This query creates a row with a datetime value, then calculates two new fields: one by adding three hours to the datetime, and another by subtracting three hours (using the TO_TIMEDURATION function) from the same datetime.

```esql
ROW x = "2024-01-01"::datetime
| EVAL y = x + "3 hours"::time_duration, z = x - TO_TIMEDURATION("3 hours");
```
This example adds and subtracts a three-hour time duration to a datetime value.
