# VALUES

The VALUES function returns the unique values from a field as a multivalued field. The order of the returned values is not guaranteed. If you need the values in a specific order, use the `MV_SORT` function.

## Syntax

`VALUES(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The field from which to extract unique values.

## Examples

Get the unique first names for each first letter, sorted alphabetically by first letter:

This query extracts the first letter from each employee's first name, groups the employees by this first letter, collects all unique first names for each group, sorts these names alphabetically, and finally sorts the groups by the first letter.

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL first_letter = SUBSTRING(first_name, 0, 1)
| STATS first_name = MV_SORT(VALUES(first_name)) BY first_letter
| SORT first_letter
```

## Limitations

- This function can use a significant amount of memory. Aggregations do not grow beyond available memory, so if too many values are collected, the query will fail with a Circuit Breaker Error.
- Use the `TOP` function if you need to keep repeated values.
