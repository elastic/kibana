# VALUES

The VALUES function returns the unique values from a field as a multivalued field. The order of the returned values is not guaranteed. To return values in order, use `MV_SORT`.

## Syntax

`VALUES(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The field from which to extract unique values.

## Examples

The following query groups employees by the first letter of their first name, then collects all unique first names for each group and sorts them alphabetically. Finally, the results are sorted by the first letter.

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL first_letter = SUBSTRING(first_name, 0, 1)
| STATS first_name = MV_SORT(VALUES(first_name)) BY first_letter
| SORT first_letter
```

This example groups employees by the first letter of their first name and collects all unique first names for each group, sorted alphabetically.

## Limitations

- This function can use a significant amount of memory. Aggregations do not grow beyond available memory. If too many values are collected to fit in memory, the query will fail with a Circuit Breaker Error.
- Use `TOP` if you need to keep repeated values.
