## VALUES

The `VALUES` function retrieves all values in a group as a multivalued field. The order of the returned values is not guaranteed. To ensure the values are returned in order, use the `MV_SORT` function.

## Syntax

`VALUES(field)`

### Parameters

#### `field`

The field from which to retrieve all values.

## Examples

### Example 1: Grouping and sorting values

Retrieve the first letter of employee first names, group the names by their first letter, and sort the results:

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL first_letter = SUBSTRING(first_name, 0, 1)
| STATS first_name = MV_SORT(VALUES(first_name)) BY first_letter
| SORT first_letter
```

## Notes

- **Technical Preview**: This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
- **Memory Usage**: The `VALUES` function can consume a significant amount of memory. ES|QL does not currently grow aggregations beyond memory limits. If the function collects more values than can fit into memory, the query will fail with a Circuit Breaker Error. Avoid using this function in production environments.
