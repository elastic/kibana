# DECAY

Calculates a relevance score that decreases based on the distance of a numeric, spatial, or date value from a target origin. The score ranges from 0 to 1, depending on how far the field value is from the specified origin. The function supports configurable decay types and options, allowing you to control how the score decays with distance. For spatial data, scale and offset use distance units (e.g., "10km", "5mi") for geo points and numeric values for cartesian points. For date data, scale and offset use time durations. For numeric data, numeric values are used.

## Syntax

`DECAY(value, origin, scale, options, offset, type, decay)`

### Parameters

#### value

The input value to which decay scoring is applied.

#### origin

The central point from which distances are calculated.

#### scale

The distance from the origin where the function returns the specified decay value.

#### options

Additional named parameters for the decay function.

#### offset

(Optional) The distance from the origin where no decay occurs. Accepts double, integer, long, time_duration, keyword, or text.

#### type

(Optional) The decay function to use. Supported values are: linear, exponential, or gaussian.

#### decay

(Optional) The multiplier value returned at the scale distance from the origin.

## Examples

The following query calculates a decay score for each employee's salary using a linear decay function. The decay score decreases as the salary moves further from the origin (0), with a scale of 100,000, an offset of 5, and a decay value of 0.5. The results are then sorted in descending order by the decay score, so employees with salaries closer to the origin appear first.

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL decay_result = decay(salary, 0, 100000, {"offset": 5, "decay": 0.5, "type": "linear"})
| SORT decay_result DESC
```
