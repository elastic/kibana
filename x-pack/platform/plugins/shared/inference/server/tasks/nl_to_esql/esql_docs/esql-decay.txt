# DECAY

Calculates a relevance score that decreases based on the distance of a numeric, spatial, or date value from a target origin, using configurable decay functions. The score ranges from 0 to 1, depending on how far the field value is from the specified origin. The distance can be numeric, spatial, or temporal, depending on the data type. Additional options for the decay function can be specified using function named parameters. For spatial queries, scale and offset for geo points use distance units (e.g., "10km", "5mi"), while cartesian points use numeric values. For date queries, scale and offset use time duration values. For numeric queries, use numeric values.

## Syntax

`DECAY(value, origin, scale, options, offset, type, decay)`

### Parameters

#### value

The input value to apply decay scoring to.

#### origin

Central point from which the distances are calculated.

#### scale

Distance from the origin where the function returns the decay value.

#### options

Additional named parameters for the decay function.

#### offset

(Optional) Distance from the origin where no decay occurs. Accepts double, integer, long, time_duration, keyword, or text.

#### type

(Optional) Decay function to use. Accepts: linear, exponential, or gaussian.

#### decay

(Optional) Multiplier value returned at the scale distance from the origin.

## Examples

Calculates a decay score for each employee's salary using a linear decay function, with an offset of 5 and a decay value of 0.5, then sorts the employees by their decay score in descending order.

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL decay_result = decay(salary, 0, 100000, {"offset": 5, "decay": 0.5, "type": "linear"})
| SORT decay_result DESC
```
