# CLAMP

The CLAMP function restricts values within a specified range, ensuring that all samples are no less than a minimum value and no greater than a maximum value.

## Syntax

`CLAMP(field, min, max)`

### Parameters

#### field

Numeric expression to be clamped. If the value is `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### min

The minimum value to clamp the data to.

#### max

The maximum value to clamp the data to.

## Examples

The following query clamps the `network.cost` value so that it is not less than the result of `clamp_max(network.bytes_in, 5)` and not greater than `network.bytes_in / 100`. The resulting clamped value is stored in a new field called `full_clamped_cost`, and only this field along with the timestamp is kept in the output.

```esql
TS k8s
| EVAL full_clamped_cost = clamp(network.cost, clamp_max(network.bytes_in, 5), network.bytes_in / 100)
| KEEP full_clamped_cost, @timestamp
```
