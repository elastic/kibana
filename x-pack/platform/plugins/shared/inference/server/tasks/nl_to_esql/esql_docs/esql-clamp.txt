# CLAMP

The CLAMP function restricts values within a specified range, setting a lower limit (`min`) and an upper limit (`max`). Any value below the minimum is set to the minimum, and any value above the maximum is set to the maximum.

## Syntax

`CLAMP(field, min, max)`

### Parameters

#### field

Numeric expression to be clamped. If the value is `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### min

The minimum value to clamp the data to.

#### max

The maximum value to clamp the data to.

## Examples

The following query clamps the `network.cost` field so that its value is not less than the result of `clamp_max(network.bytes_in, 5)` and not greater than `network.bytes_in / 100`. It then creates a new field called `full_clamped_cost` with the clamped value and keeps only this field and the `@timestamp` field in the output.

```esql
TS k8s
| EVAL full_clamped_cost = clamp(network.cost, clamp_max(network.bytes_in, 5), network.bytes_in / 100)
| KEEP full_clamped_cost, @timestamp
```
