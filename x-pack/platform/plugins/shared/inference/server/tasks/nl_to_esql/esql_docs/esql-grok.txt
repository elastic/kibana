# GROK

The GROK command is used to extract structured data from a string by matching it against patterns based on regular expressions. It extracts the specified patterns as columns.

## Syntax

`GROK input "pattern"`

### Parameters

#### input

The column that contains the string you want to structure. If the column has multiple values, GROK will process each value.

#### pattern

A grok pattern. If a field name conflicts with an existing column, the existing column is discarded. If a field name is used more than once, a multi-valued column will be created with one value for each occurrence of the field name.

## Examples

The following example parses a string that contains a timestamp, an IP address, an email address, and a number:

Extracts the date, IP address, email address, and number from the input string and places them into separate columns.

```esql
ROW a = "2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z 127.0.0.1 some.email@foo.com 42"
| GROK a """%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:date} %{IP:ip} %{EMAILADDRESS:email} %{NUMBER:num}"""
| KEEP date, ip, email, num
```

By default, GROK outputs keyword string columns. int and float types can be converted by appending :type to the semantics in the pattern. For example, `{NUMBER:num:int}`:

Extracts the date, IP address, email address, and number from the input string, converting the number to an integer type.

```esql
ROW a = "2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z 127.0.0.1 some.email@foo.com 42"
| GROK a """%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:date} %{IP:ip} %{EMAILADDRESS:email} %{NUMBER:num:int}"""
| KEEP date, ip, email, num
```

For other type conversions, use type conversion functions:

Extracts the date, IP address, email address, and integer number, then converts the extracted date string to a datetime type.

```esql
ROW a = "2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z 127.0.0.1 some.email@foo.com 42"
| GROK a """%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:date} %{IP:ip} %{EMAILADDRESS:email} %{NUMBER:num:int}"""
| KEEP date, ip, email, num
| EVAL date = TO_DATETIME(date)
```

If a field name is used more than once, GROK creates a multi-valued column:

Extracts multiple parts from the zip_code field and creates a multi-valued column containing each part.

```esql
FROM addresses
| KEEP city.name, zip_code
| GROK zip_code """%{WORD:zip_parts} %{WORD:zip_parts}"""
```
