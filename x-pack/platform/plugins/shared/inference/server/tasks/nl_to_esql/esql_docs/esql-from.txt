# FROM

The `FROM` source command returns a table with data from a data stream, index,
or alias. Each row in the resulting table represents a document. Each column
corresponds to a field, and can be accessed by the name of that field.
<note>
  By default, an ES|QL query without an explicit `LIMIT` uses an implicit
  limit of 1000. This applies to `FROM` too. A `FROM` command without `LIMIT`:
  ```esql
  FROM employees
  ```
  is executed as:
  ```esql
  FROM employees
  | LIMIT 1000
  ```
</note>

The `FROM` source command returns a table with data from a data stream, index,
or alias.
**Syntax**
```esql
FROM index_pattern [METADATA fields]
```

### Parameters

#### `index_pattern`

A list of indices, data streams or aliases. Supports wildcards and date math.

#### `fields`

A comma-separated list of metadata fields to retrieve.

**Examples**
```esql
FROM employees
```

You can use date math to refer to indices, aliases
and data streams. This can be useful for time series data, for example to access
today’s index:
```esql
FROM <logs-{now/d}>
```

Use comma-separated lists or wildcards to
query multiple data streams, indices, or aliases:
```esql
FROM employees-00001,other-employees-*
```

Use the format `<remote_cluster_name>:<target>` to
query data streams and indices on remote clusters:
```esql
FROM cluster_one:employees-00001,cluster_two:other-employees-*
```

Use the optional `METADATA` directive to enable
metadata fields:
```esql
FROM employees METADATA _id
```

Use enclosing double quotes (`"`) or three enclosing double quotes (`"""`) to escape index names
that contain special characters:
```esql
FROM "this=that", """this[that"""
```
