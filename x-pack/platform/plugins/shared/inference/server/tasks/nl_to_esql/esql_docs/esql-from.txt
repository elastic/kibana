# FROM

The FROM command retrieves a table of data from a data stream, index, or alias. Each row in the resulting table represents a document, and each column corresponds to a field that can be accessed by its name.

## Syntax

`FROM index_pattern [METADATA fields]`

### Parameters

#### index_pattern

A list of indices, data streams, or aliases to query. Supports wildcards and date math.

#### fields

A comma-separated list of metadata fields to retrieve. This parameter is optional.

## Examples

Retrieve all documents from the `employees` index:

This query fetches all documents from the `employees` index, returning each document as a row and each field as a column.

```esql
FROM employees
```

Access today’s index using date math:

This query retrieves documents from the index named with today's date, using date math to dynamically select the current day's logs.

```esql
FROM <logs-{now/d}>
```

Query multiple data streams, indices, or aliases using comma-separated lists or wildcards:

This query pulls documents from both the `employees-00001` index and any indices matching the pattern `other-employees-*`, allowing you to combine data from multiple sources.

```esql
FROM employees-00001,other-employees-*
```

Query data streams and indices on remote clusters using the format `<remote_cluster_name>:<target>`:

This query retrieves documents from the `employees-00001` index on `cluster_one` and from all indices matching `other-employees-*` on `cluster_two`, enabling cross-cluster querying.

```esql
FROM cluster_one:employees-00001,cluster_two:other-employees-*
```

Enable metadata fields with the optional `METADATA` directive:

This query fetches all documents from the `employees` index and includes the `_id` metadata field for each document in the results.

```esql
FROM employees METADATA _id
```

Escape index names containing special characters using double quotes or triple double quotes:

This query demonstrates how to retrieve documents from indices with special characters in their names by escaping them with quotes.

```esql
FROM "this=that", """this[that"""
```

## Limitations

By default, a query without an explicit `LIMIT` uses an implicit limit of 1000 rows. For example, `FROM employees` is executed as `FROM employees | LIMIT 1000`.
