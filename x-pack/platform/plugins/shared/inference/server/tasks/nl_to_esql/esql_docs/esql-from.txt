# FROM

The FROM command retrieves a table of data from a data stream, index, or alias. Each row in the resulting table represents a document, and each column corresponds to a field that can be accessed by its name. By default, if no explicit LIMIT is set, the query returns up to 1000 rows.

## Syntax

`FROM index_pattern [METADATA fields]`

### Parameters

#### index_pattern

A list of indices, data streams, or aliases to query. Supports wildcards and date math.

#### fields

A comma-separated list of metadata fields to retrieve. (Optional)

## Examples

Retrieves all documents from the `employees` index.

```esql
FROM employees
```

Fetches documents from today's index using date math in the index name.

```esql
FROM <logs-{now/d}>
```

Queries documents from multiple indices or data streams using a comma-separated list and wildcards.

```esql
FROM employees-00001,other-employees-*
```

Retrieves documents from data streams and indices located on remote clusters.

```esql
FROM cluster_one:employees-00001,cluster_two:other-employees-*
```

Fetches documents from the `employees` index and includes the `_id` metadata field for each document.

```esql
FROM employees METADATA _id
```

Accesses indices with special characters in their names by escaping them with double or triple double quotes.

```esql
FROM "this=that", """this[that"""
```

## Limitations

By default, a query without an explicit LIMIT uses an implicit limit of 1000 rows. For example, `FROM employees` is equivalent to `FROM employees | LIMIT 1000`.
