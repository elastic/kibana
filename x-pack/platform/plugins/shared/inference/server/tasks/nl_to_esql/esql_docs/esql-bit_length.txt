# BIT_LENGTH

Returns the bit length of a string. All strings are in UTF-8, so a single character can use multiple bytes.

## Syntax

`BIT_LENGTH(string)`

### Parameters

#### string

String expression. If the value is `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

This query retrieves all airports located in India, keeps only the city field, and then calculates both the character length and the bit length (in bits) of each city name.

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE country == "India"
| KEEP city
| EVAL fn_length = LENGTH(city), fn_bit_length = BIT_LENGTH(city)
```

Calculate the bit length and character length of city names for airports in India.
