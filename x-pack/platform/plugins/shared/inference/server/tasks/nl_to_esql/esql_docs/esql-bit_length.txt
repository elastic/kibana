# BIT_LENGTH

This function calculates the bit length of a given string.

## Syntax

`BIT_LENGTH(string)`

### Parameters

#### string

This is the string whose bit length you want to calculate. If `null` is provided, the function will return `null`.

**Note**: Strings are in UTF-8 format, which means a single character may occupy multiple bytes.

## Examples

In the below example, the `BIT_LENGTH` function is used to calculate the bit length of the 'city' field from the 'airports' index where the 'country' is "India".

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE country == "India"
| KEEP city
| EVAL fn_length = LENGTH(city), fn_bit_length = BIT_LENGTH(city)
```
This will return two new fields - 'fn_length' representing the length of the city name and 'fn_bit_length' representing the bit length of the city name.
