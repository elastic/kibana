# BIT_LENGTH

Returns the bit length of a string. All strings are in UTF-8, so a single character can use multiple bytes.

## Syntax

`BIT_LENGTH(string)`

### Parameters

#### string

String expression. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

Calculate the bit length and character length of airport city names in India:

This query retrieves airport records from India, keeps only the city field, and then calculates both the number of characters and the number of bits used to represent each city name.

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE country == "India"
| KEEP city
| EVAL fn_length = LENGTH(city), fn_bit_length = BIT_LENGTH(city)
```
