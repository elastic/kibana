# COALESCE

Returns the first argument that is not null. If all arguments are null, it returns `null`.

## Syntax

`COALESCE(first, rest)`

### Parameters

#### first

Expression to evaluate.

#### rest

Other expression to evaluate.

## Examples

Calculate the first non-null value between columns `a` and `b`:

This query creates a row with two columns, `a` (set to null) and `b` (set to "b"), and then uses the `COALESCE` function to return the first non-null value between `a` and `b`. In this case, since `a` is null, the result will be the value of `b`, which is "b".

```esql
ROW a=null, b="b"
| EVAL COALESCE(a, b)
```
