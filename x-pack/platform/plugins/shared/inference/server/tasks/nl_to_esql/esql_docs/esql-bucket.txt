# BUCKET

Creates groups of values - buckets - out of a datetime or numeric input. The size of the buckets can either be provided directly, or chosen based on a recommended count and values range.

**Syntax**
`BUCKET(field, buckets, from, to)`

### Parameters

#### `field`

Numeric or date expression from which to derive buckets.

#### `buckets`

Target number of buckets, or desired bucket size if `from` and `to` parameters are omitted.

#### `from`

Start of the range. Can be a number, a date or a date expressed as a string.

#### `to`

End of the range. Can be a number, a date or a date expressed as a string.

**Supported types**

**Examples**
`BUCKET` can work in two modes: one in which the size of the bucket is computed
based on a buckets count recommendation (four parameters) and a range, and
another in which the bucket size is provided directly (two parameters).
Using a target number of buckets, a start of a range, and an end of a range,
`BUCKET` picks an appropriate bucket size to generate the target number of buckets or fewer.
For example, asking for at most 20 buckets over a year results in monthly buckets:
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE hire_date >= "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z" AND hire_date < "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z"
| STATS hire_date = MV_SORT(VALUES(hire_date)) BY month = BUCKET(hire_date, 20, "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z")
```

The goal isn’t to provide **exactly** the target number of buckets,
it’s to pick a range that people are comfortable with that provides at most the target number of buckets.
Combine `BUCKET` with an aggregation to create a histogram:
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE hire_date >= "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z" AND hire_date < "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z"
| STATS hires_per_month = COUNT(*) BY month = BUCKET(hire_date, 20, "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z")
| SORT month
```

<note>
  `BUCKET` does not create buckets that don’t match any documents.
  That’s why this example is missing `1985-03-01` and other dates.
</note>

Asking for more buckets can result in a smaller range.
For example, asking for at most 100 buckets in a year results in weekly buckets:
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE hire_date >= "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z" AND hire_date < "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z"
| STATS hires_per_week = COUNT(*) BY week = BUCKET(hire_date, 100, "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z")
```

<note>
  `BUCKET` does not filter any rows. It only uses the provided range to pick a good bucket size.
  For rows with a value outside of the range, it returns a bucket value that corresponds to a bucket outside the range.
  Combine `BUCKET` with `WHERE` to filter rows.
</note>

If the desired bucket size is known in advance, simply provide it as the second
argument, leaving the range out:
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE hire_date >= "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z" AND hire_date < "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z"
| STATS hires_per_week = COUNT(*) BY week = BUCKET(hire_date, 1 week)
| SORT week
```

<note>
  When providing the bucket size as the second parameter, it must be a time
  duration or date period. Also the reference is epoch, which starts at `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`.
</note>

`BUCKET` can also operate on numeric fields. For example, to create a salary histogram:
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS COUNT(*) by bs = BUCKET(salary, 20, 25324, 74999)
| SORT bs
```

Unlike the earlier example that intentionally filters on a date range, you rarely want to filter on a numeric range.
You have to find the `min` and `max` separately. ES|QL doesn’t yet have an easy way to do that automatically.
The range can be omitted if the desired bucket size is known in advance. Simply
provide it as the second argument:
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE hire_date >= "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z" AND hire_date < "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z"
| STATS c = COUNT(1) BY b = BUCKET(salary, 5000.)
| SORT b
```

Create hourly buckets for the last 24 hours, and calculate the number of events per hour:
```esql
FROM sample_data
| WHERE @timestamp >= NOW() - 1 day and @timestamp < NOW()
| STATS COUNT(*) BY bucket = BUCKET(@timestamp, 25, NOW() - 1 day, NOW())
```

Create monthly buckets for the year 1985, and calculate the average salary by hiring month
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE hire_date >= "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z" AND hire_date < "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z"
| STATS AVG(salary) BY bucket = BUCKET(hire_date, 20, "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z")
```

`BUCKET` may be used in both the aggregating and grouping part of the
STATS ... BY ... command provided that in the aggregating
part the function is referenced by an alias defined in the
grouping part, or that it is invoked with the exact same expression:
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS s1 = b1 + 1, s2 = BUCKET(salary / 1000 + 999, 50.) + 2 BY b1 = BUCKET(salary / 100 + 99, 50.), b2 = BUCKET(salary / 1000 + 999, 50.)
| SORT b1, b2
| KEEP s1, b1, s2, b2
```

Sometimes you need to change the start value of each bucket by a given duration (similar to date histogram
aggregation’s `offset` parameter). To do so, you will need to
take into account how the language handles expressions within the `STATS` command: if these contain functions or
arithmetic operators, a virtual `EVAL` is inserted before and/or after the `STATS` command. Consequently, a double
compensation is needed to adjust the bucketed date value before the aggregation and then again after. For instance,
inserting a negative offset of `1 hour` to buckets of `1 year` looks like this:
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS dates = MV_SORT(VALUES(birth_date)) BY b = BUCKET(birth_date + 1 HOUR, 1 YEAR) - 1 HOUR
| EVAL d_count = MV_COUNT(dates)
```
