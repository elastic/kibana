# BYTE_LENGTH

Returns the byte length of a string. All strings are in UTF-8, so a single character can use multiple bytes.

## Syntax

`BYTE_LENGTH(string)`

### Parameters

#### string

String expression. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

This query retrieves the city names of airports located in India, then calculates both the character length and the byte length (in UTF-8 encoding) for each city name.

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE country == "India"
| KEEP city
| EVAL fn_length = LENGTH(city), fn_byte_length = BYTE_LENGTH(city)
```
