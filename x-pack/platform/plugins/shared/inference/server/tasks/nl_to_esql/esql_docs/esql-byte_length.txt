# BYTE_LENGTH

This function calculates the byte length of a given string.

## Syntax

`BYTE_LENGTH(string)`

### Parameters

#### string

The text string for which the byte length is to be determined. If `null` is provided, the function will return `null`.

## Examples

Following is an example of how BYTE_LENGTH is implemented in an ES|QL query:

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE country == "India"
| KEEP city
| EVAL fn_length = LENGTH(city), fn_byte_length = BYTE_LENGTH(city)
```

In the above example, BYTE_LENGTH is used to calculate the byte size of the 'city' field. The LENGTH function is used as a comparison to show the different counts between the number of characters and the number of bytes. Here, the function is particularly useful because text strings in UTF-8 can contain characters that use several bytes, so the byte length and character length of a string may differ.
