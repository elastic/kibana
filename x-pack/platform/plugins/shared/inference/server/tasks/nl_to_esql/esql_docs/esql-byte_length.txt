# BYTE_LENGTH

Returns the byte length of a string. All strings are in UTF-8, so a single character can use multiple bytes.

## Syntax

`BYTE_LENGTH(string)`

### Parameters

#### string

String expression to measure. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

This query retrieves all airports located in India, keeps only the `city` field, and then calculates two new fields: `fn_length`, which is the number of characters in the city name, and `fn_byte_length`, which is the number of bytes used by the city name in UTF-8 encoding.

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE country == "India"
| KEEP city
| EVAL fn_length = LENGTH(city), fn_byte_length = BYTE_LENGTH(city)
```

Calculate both the character length and byte length of city names for airports in India.
