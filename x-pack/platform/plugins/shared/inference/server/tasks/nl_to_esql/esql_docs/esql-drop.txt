# DROP

The `DROP` command removes one or more columns from the result set.

## Syntax

`DROP columns`

### Parameters

#### columns

A comma-separated list of columns to remove. Supports wildcards.

## Examples

Remove a specific column:

```esql
FROM employees
| DROP height
```

This example shows how to drop columns that match a more complex pattern using wildcards.

```esql
FROM employees
| DROP emp_*
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `DROP` command in conjunction with other commands like `KEEP` and `SORT`.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height, weight
| DROP weight
| SORT height DESC
```

### Limitations
- The `DROP` command does not support nested fields.
- It cannot be used to drop columns of unsupported types as specified in the ES|QL limitations.
