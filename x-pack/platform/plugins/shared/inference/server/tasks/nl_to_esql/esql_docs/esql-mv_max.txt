# MV_MAX

The MV_MAX function converts a multivalued expression into a single-valued column containing the maximum value. For string columns, it selects the last string based on their UTF-8 representation, comparing byte by byte.

## Syntax

`MV_MAX(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

A multivalue expression to be reduced to its maximum value.

## Examples

Calculate the maximum value from a list of numbers:

This query creates a row with a field `a` containing the list `[3, 5, 1]`, then uses `MV_MAX` to find the maximum value in the list and stores it in a new field called `max_a`.

```esql
ROW a=[3, 5, 1]
| EVAL max_a = MV_MAX(a)
```

Find the maximum string value in a list, comparing their UTF-8 representation:

This query creates a row with a field `a` containing the list of strings `["foo", "zoo", "bar"]`, then uses `MV_MAX` to find the string with the highest value according to UTF-8 byte order and stores it in a new field called `max_a`.

```esql
ROW a=["foo", "zoo", "bar"]
| EVAL max_a = MV_MAX(a)
```
