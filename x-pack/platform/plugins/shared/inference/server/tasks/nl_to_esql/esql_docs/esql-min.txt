# MIN

The MIN function returns the minimum value of a specified field.

## Syntax

`MIN(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The column for which you want to find the minimum value.

## Examples

The following query retrieves the minimum value found in the `languages` column from the `employees` dataset.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MIN(languages)
```

This query calculates the minimum of the average salary change per employee. It first computes the average salary change for each employee (using `MV_AVG(salary_change)`), and then finds the smallest of these average values.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS min_avg_salary_change = MIN(MV_AVG(salary_change))
```
