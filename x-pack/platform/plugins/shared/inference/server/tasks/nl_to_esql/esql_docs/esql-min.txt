# MIN

The MIN function returns the minimum value of a specified field.

## Syntax

`MIN(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The field for which you want to find the minimum value.

## Examples

The following query retrieves the minimum value found in the `languages` field across all documents in the `employees` index:

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MIN(languages)
```

This query first calculates the average of the `salary_change` field for each row (handling multi-valued fields), and then finds the minimum of these average values, assigning the result to `min_avg_salary_change`:

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS min_avg_salary_change = MIN(MV_AVG(salary_change))
```
