# ABSENT_OVER_TIME

Calculates the absence of a field in the output result over a specified time range.

## Syntax

`ABSENT_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the absence for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the absence.

## Examples

Calculates the maximum absence of the `events_received` field for each pod within 2-minute time buckets, filtering for the "prod" cluster and pod named "two".

```esql
TS k8s
| WHERE cluster == "prod" AND pod == "two"
| STATS events_received = MAX(ABSENT_OVER_TIME(events_received)) BY pod, time_bucket = TBUCKET(2 minute)
```
