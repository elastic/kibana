# ABSENT_OVER_TIME

Calculates the absence of a field in the output result over a specified time range.

## Syntax

`ABSENT_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the absence for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the absence.

## Examples

The following query calculates the maximum absence of the `events_received` field for each pod in 2-minute time buckets. It filters for records where the cluster is "prod" and the pod is "two", then groups the results by pod and 2-minute time intervals, computing the maximum absence of `events_received` within each group.

```esql
TS k8s
| WHERE cluster == "prod" AND pod == "two"
| STATS events_received = MAX(ABSENT_OVER_TIME(events_received)) BY pod, time_bucket = TBUCKET(2 minute)
```
