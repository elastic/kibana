# COUNT_DISTINCT_OVER_TIME

Calculates the count of distinct values over time for a specified field.

## Syntax

`COUNT_DISTINCT_OVER_TIME(field, precision)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the distinct count for.

#### precision

Precision threshold. The maximum supported value is 40000. Thresholds above this number will have the same effect as a threshold of 40000. The default value is 3000. For more details, refer to `AGG-COUNT-DISTINCT-APPROXIMATE`.

## Examples

Calculate the count of distinct `network.cost` values over time, using both the default and a custom precision threshold:

This query calculates the number of unique `network.cost` values for each cluster and 1-minute time bucket, comparing results using the default precision and a lower precision threshold.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS distincts=COUNT_DISTINCT(COUNT_DISTINCT_OVER_TIME(network.cost)),
        distincts_imprecise=COUNT_DISTINCT(COUNT_DISTINCT_OVER_TIME(network.cost, 100))
  BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(1minute)
```

## Limitations

- The maximum supported precision value is 40000. Any value above this will be treated as 40000.
