# INFIX OPERATORS

Infix operators provide convenient ways to perform type casting, pattern matching, and membership tests directly within queries. These operators include `::` for casting, `IN` for membership, `LIKE` and `RLIKE` for pattern matching, and `:` for match queries.

## Syntax

- Cast: `expression::TYPE`
- IN: `expression IN (value1, value2, ...)`
- LIKE: `expression LIKE pattern` or `expression LIKE (pattern1, pattern2, ...)`
- RLIKE: `expression RLIKE pattern` or `expression RLIKE (pattern1, pattern2, ...)`
- Match: `field:query`

### Parameters

#### Cast (`::`)

Provides an alternative syntax to the TO_<type> conversion functions, allowing you to cast values to a specific type.

#### IN

Tests whether a field or expression equals any element in a list of literals, fields, or expressions.

#### LIKE

Filters data based on string patterns using wildcards. The left-hand side is typically a field or literal, and the right-hand side is the pattern. Supports `*` (zero or more characters) and `?` (one character) wildcards. Patterns can be single or multiple, and escaping is done with backslash `\`. Triple-quoted strings `"""` can be used to simplify escaping.

#### RLIKE

Filters data using regular expression patterns. The left-hand side is typically a field or literal, and the right-hand side is the regular expression. Supports single or multiple patterns, and escaping is done with backslash `\`. Triple-quoted strings `"""` can be used to simplify escaping.

#### Match (`:`)

Performs a match query on the specified field, returning true if the provided query matches the row. Equivalent to the match function.

## Examples

This example casts the string "0" to an integer, adds 1, casts the result to a string, concatenates ".2.3", and finally casts the result to a VERSION type.
```esql
ROW ver = CONCAT(("0"::INT + 1)::STRING, ".2.3")::VERSION
```

This example checks if the result of `c-a` is present in the list `(3, b / 2, a)`.
```esql
ROW a = 1, b = 4, c = 3
| WHERE c-a IN (3, b / 2, a)
```

This example filters employees whose first name matches the pattern "?b*".
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE first_name LIKE """?b*"""
| KEEP first_name, last_name
```

This example matches the string "foo * bar" by escaping the asterisk.
```esql
ROW message = "foo * bar"
| WHERE message LIKE "foo \\* bar"
```

This example matches "foo * bar" using triple-quoted strings for easier escaping.
```esql
ROW message = "foo * bar"
| WHERE message LIKE """foo \* bar"""
```

This example returns true if the message matches either "foo*" or "bar?".
```esql
ROW message = "foobar"
| WHERE message like ("foo*", "bar?")
```

This example uses a placeholder for the pattern in the LIKE operator.
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE first_name LIKE ?pattern
| KEEP first_name, last_name
```

This example filters employees whose first name matches the regular expression `.leja.*`.
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE first_name RLIKE """.leja.*"""
| KEEP first_name, last_name
```

This example matches the string "foo ( bar" by escaping the parenthesis.
```esql
ROW message = "foo ( bar"
| WHERE message RLIKE "foo \\( bar"
```

This example matches "foo ( bar" using triple-quoted strings for easier escaping.
```esql
ROW message = "foo ( bar"
| WHERE message RLIKE """foo \( bar"""
```

This example returns true if the message matches either "foo.*" or "bar.".
```esql
ROW message = "foobar"
| WHERE message RLIKE ("foo.*", "bar.")
```

This example uses a placeholder for the pattern in the RLIKE operator.
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE first_name RLIKE ?pattern
| KEEP first_name, last_name
```

This example returns books where the author field matches "Faulkner".
```esql
FROM books
| WHERE author:"Faulkner"
```
