# INFIX OPERATORS

- Cast `::`
- `IN`
- `LIKE`
- `RLIKE`
- Match `:` `stack: preview` `serverless: preview`

### Cast (`::`)

The `::` operator provides a convenient alternative syntax to the TO_<type> conversion functions.
**Example**
```esql
ROW ver = CONCAT(("0"::INT + 1)::STRING, ".2.3")::VERSION
```

### `IN`

The `IN` operator allows testing whether a field or expression equals an element in a list of literals, fields or expressions.
**Example**
```esql
ROW a = 1, b = 4, c = 3
| WHERE c-a IN (3, b / 2, a)
```

### `LIKE`

Use `LIKE` to filter data based on string patterns using wildcards. `LIKE` usually acts on a field placed on the left-hand side of the operator, but it can also act on a constant (literal) expression. The right-hand side of the operator represents the pattern.
The following wildcard characters are supported:
- `*` matches zero or more characters.
- `?` matches one character.

**Supported types**

**Example**
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE first_name LIKE """?b*"""
| KEEP first_name, last_name
```

Matching the exact characters `*` and `.` will require escaping.
The escape character is backslash `\`. Since also backslash is a special character in string literals,
it will require further escaping.
```esql
ROW message = "foo * bar"
| WHERE message LIKE "foo \\* bar"
```

To reduce the overhead of escaping, we suggest using triple quotes strings `"""`
```esql
ROW message = "foo * bar"
| WHERE message LIKE """foo \* bar"""
```

```
stack: ga 9.1
serverless: ga
```

Both a single pattern or a list of patterns are supported. If a list of patterns is provided,
the expression will return true if any of the patterns match.
```esql
ROW message = "foobar"
| WHERE message like ("foo*", "bar?")
```

Patterns may be specified with REST query placeholders as well
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE first_name LIKE ?pattern
| KEEP first_name, last_name
```

```
stack: ga 9.3
```

### `RLIKE`

Use `RLIKE` to filter data based on string patterns using regular expressions. `RLIKE` usually acts on a field placed on the left-hand side of the operator, but it can also act on a constant (literal) expression. The right-hand side of the operator represents the pattern.
**Supported types**

**Example**
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE first_name RLIKE """.leja.*"""
| KEEP first_name, last_name
```

Matching special characters (eg. `.`, `*`, `(`...) will require escaping.
The escape character is backslash `\`. Since also backslash is a special character in string literals,
it will require further escaping.
```esql
ROW message = "foo ( bar"
| WHERE message RLIKE "foo \\( bar"
```

To reduce the overhead of escaping, we suggest using triple quotes strings `"""`
```esql
ROW message = "foo ( bar"
| WHERE message RLIKE """foo \( bar"""
```

```
stack: ga 9.2
serverless: ga
```

Both a single pattern or a list of patterns are supported. If a list of patterns is provided,
the expression will return true if any of the patterns match.
```esql
ROW message = "foobar"
| WHERE message RLIKE ("foo.*", "bar.")
```

Patterns may be specified with REST query placeholders as well
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE first_name RLIKE ?pattern
| KEEP first_name, last_name
```

```
stack: ga 9.3
```

### Match operator (`:`)

```
stack: preview 9.0, ga 9.1
```

The only search operator is match (`:`).
**Syntax**
`INFIX OPERATORS()`

The match operator performs a match query on the specified field. Returns true if the provided query matches the row.
The match operator is equivalent to the match function.
For using the function syntax, or adding match query parameters, you can use the match function.
**Supported types**

**Example**
```esql
FROM books
| WHERE author:"Faulkner"
```
