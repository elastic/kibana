# CLAMP_MIN

The CLAMP_MIN function limits all input sample values to a specified lower bound. Any value below the given minimum is set to that minimum.

## Syntax

`CLAMP_MIN(field, min)`

### Parameters

#### field

The field to clamp.

#### min

The minimum value to clamp data to.

## Examples

The following query calculates the sum of network cost values after applying different clamping functions, grouped by 1-minute time buckets. Specifically, it computes:
- `full_clamped_cost`: the sum of network cost values clamped between 1 and 2,
- `clamped_cost`: the sum of network cost values clamped to a maximum of 1,
- `clamped_min_cost`: the sum of network cost values clamped to a minimum of 10.
All results are grouped by 1-minute intervals based on the `@timestamp` field.

```esql
FROM k8s
| STATS full_clamped_cost=sum(clamp(network.cost, 1, 2)), clamped_cost=sum(clamp_max(network.cost, 1)), clamped_min_cost=sum(clamp_min(network.cost, 10)) BY time_bucket = bucket(@timestamp,1minute)
```
