# CLAMP_MIN

The CLAMP_MIN function restricts all input sample values to a specified lower bound. Any value below the minimum is set to the minimum value.

## Syntax

`CLAMP_MIN(field, min)`

### Parameters

#### field

The field whose values you want to clamp.

#### min

The minimum value to clamp data to.

## Examples

Calculates the sum of network costs using different clamping functions, and groups the results by one-minute time buckets.

```esql
FROM k8s
| STATS full_clamped_cost=sum(clamp(network.cost, 1, 2)), clamped_cost=sum(clamp_max(network.cost, 1)), clamped_min_cost=sum(clamp_min(network.cost, 10)) BY time_bucket = bucket(@timestamp,1minute)
```
