# CLAMP_MIN

The CLAMP_MIN function restricts all input sample values to a specified lower bound. Any value below the minimum is set to the minimum value.

## Syntax

`CLAMP_MIN(field, min)`

### Parameters

#### field

The field whose values you want to clamp.

#### min

The minimum value to clamp data to.

## Examples

The following query demonstrates how to clamp the minimum value of `network.cost` to 10, and aggregate the results by minute:

```esql
FROM k8s
| STATS full_clamped_cost=sum(clamp(network.cost, 1, 2)), clamped_cost=sum(clamp_max(network.cost, 1)), clamped_min_cost=sum(clamp_min(network.cost, 10)) BY time_bucket = bucket(@timestamp,1minute)
```
This query retrieves data from the `k8s` index and calculates three different sums for the `network.cost` field, each using a different clamping function. Specifically, it computes the sum of `network.cost` values clamped to a minimum of 10 using `clamp_min`, ensuring that no value below 10 is included in the sum. The results are grouped into one-minute intervals based on the `@timestamp` field.
