## DATE_DIFF

Calculates the difference between two timestamps in multiples of a specified time unit. If the start timestamp is later than the end timestamp, the result is negative.

## Syntax

`DATE_DIFF(unit, startTimestamp, endTimestamp)`

### Parameters

#### `unit`

The unit of time for the difference calculation.

#### `startTimestamp`

A string representing the starting timestamp.

#### `endTimestamp`

A string representing the ending timestamp.

## Examples

### Example 1: Calculating the difference in microseconds

```esql
ROW date1 = TO_DATETIME("2023-12-02T11:00:00.000Z"), date2 = TO_DATETIME("2023-12-02T11:00:00.001Z")
| EVAL dd_ms = DATE_DIFF("microseconds", date1, date2)
```

This example calculates the difference in microseconds between two timestamps.

### Example 2: Subtracting calendar units

When subtracting calendar units (e.g., years, months), only fully elapsed units are counted. To include remainders, switch to a smaller unit and perform additional calculations.

```esql
ROW end_23=TO_DATETIME("2023-12-31T23:59:59.999Z"),
  start_24=TO_DATETIME("2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"),
    end_24=TO_DATETIME("2024-12-31T23:59:59.999")
| EVAL end23_to_start24 = DATE_DIFF("year", end_23, start_24)
| EVAL end23_to_end24 = DATE_DIFF("year", end_23, end_24)
| EVAL start_to_end_24 = DATE_DIFF("year", start_24, end_24)
```

This example demonstrates how to calculate the difference in years between various timestamps.

## Limitations

- The supported units for `DATE_DIFF` are distinct from ES|QL’s time span literals and are not interchangeable.
- Supported abbreviations align with other established implementations but may differ from Elasticsearch’s date-time nomenclature.
