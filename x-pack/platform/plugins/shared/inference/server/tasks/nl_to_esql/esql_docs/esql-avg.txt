# AVG

The AVG function calculates the average value of a numeric field or expression.

## Syntax

`AVG(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

Expression that outputs the values to be averaged.

## Examples

Calculate the average height of employees:

This query retrieves all records from the `employees` index and calculates the average value of the `height` field across all employees.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS AVG(height)
```

Calculate the average salary change, first averaging multiple values per employee with `MV_AVG` and then using the result with `AVG`:

This query retrieves all records from the `employees` index, computes the average of the `salary_change` field for each employee using `MV_AVG` (in case there are multiple values per employee), then calculates the overall average of these per-employee averages. The result is rounded to 10 decimal places and stored in the `avg_salary_change` field.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS avg_salary_change = ROUND(AVG(MV_AVG(salary_change)), 10)
```
