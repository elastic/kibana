# AVG

The AVG function calculates the average value of a numeric field.

## Syntax

`AVG(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

Expression that outputs the values to be averaged.

## Examples

Calculate the average height of employees:

This query retrieves all records from the `employees` index and calculates the average value of the `height` field across all employees.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS AVG(height)
```

Calculate the average salary change, first averaging multiple values per row with `MV_AVG` and then using the result with `AVG`:

This query first computes the average salary change for each employee using `MV_AVG` (which averages multiple values per row), then calculates the overall average of these per-employee averages, rounding the result to 10 decimal places.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS avg_salary_change = ROUND(AVG(MV_AVG(salary_change)), 10)
```
