Calculates the maximum presence of the `events_received` field for each pod within 2-minute time buckets, filtering for pods named "two" in the "prod" cluster.

```esql
TS k8s
| WHERE cluster == "prod" AND pod == "two"
| STATS events_received = MAX(PRESENT_OVER_TIME(events_received)) BY pod, time_bucket = TBUCKET(2 minute)
```
