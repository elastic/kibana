# PRESENT_OVER_TIME

Calculates the presence of a field in the output result over a specified time range.

## Syntax

`PRESENT_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the presence for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the presence.

## Examples

The following query calculates the maximum presence of the `events_received` field for each pod named "two" in the "prod" cluster, grouping the results into 2-minute time buckets. This helps you understand how often the `events_received` field is present for each pod over time.

```esql
TS k8s
| WHERE cluster == "prod" AND pod == "two"
| STATS events_received = MAX(PRESENT_OVER_TIME(events_received)) BY pod, time_bucket = TBUCKET(2 minute)
```
