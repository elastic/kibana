# PRESENT_OVER_TIME

Calculates the presence of a field in the output result over a specified time range.

## Syntax

`PRESENT_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the presence for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the presence.

## Examples

The following query calculates the maximum presence of the `events_received` field for each pod in 2-minute time buckets. It filters the data to only include records from the "prod" cluster and the pod named "two", then groups the results by pod and 2-minute time intervals, computing the maximum presence of the `events_received` field within each bucket.

```esql
TS k8s
| WHERE cluster == "prod" AND pod == "two"
| STATS events_received = MAX(PRESENT_OVER_TIME(events_received)) BY pod, time_bucket = TBUCKET(2 minute)
```
