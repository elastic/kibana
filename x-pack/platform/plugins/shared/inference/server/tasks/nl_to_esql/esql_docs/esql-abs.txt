# ABS

Returns the absolute value of a numeric expression.

## Syntax

`ABS(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

Numeric expression to calculate the absolute value for. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

This query creates a single row with a column named `number` set to -1.0, then calculates its absolute value and stores it in a new column called `abs_number`.

```esql
ROW number = -1.0
| EVAL abs_number = ABS(number)
```

This query retrieves the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `height` columns from the `employees` index, then calculates the absolute value of the difference between 0.0 and each employee's `height`, storing the result in a new column called `abs_height`.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL abs_height = ABS(0.0 - height)
```
