# MV_MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION

The MV_MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION function converts a multivalued field into a single value representing the median absolute deviation. This is calculated as the median of the absolute differences between each value and the median of the entire set. For a variable `X`, it computes `median(|median(X) - X|)`. If the field contains an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values, rounded towards zero if not a floating point number.

## Syntax

`MV_MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

A multivalue expression containing the values to calculate the median absolute deviation from.

## Examples

Calculate the median absolute deviation and the median for a list of values:

This query creates a row with a field called `values` containing the list `[0, 2, 5, 6]`. It then calculates two new fields: `median_absolute_deviation`, which is the median absolute deviation of the values, and `median`, which is the median of the values.

```esql
ROW values = [0, 2, 5, 6]
| EVAL median_absolute_deviation = MV_MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(values), median = MV_MEDIAN(values)
```
