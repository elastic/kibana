This query creates a row with a field called `values` containing the list `[0, 2, 5, 6]`. It then calculates two new fields: `median_absolute_deviation`, which is the median absolute deviation of the values, and `median`, which is the median of the values.

```esql
ROW values = [0, 2, 5, 6]
| EVAL median_absolute_deviation = MV_MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(values), median = MV_MEDIAN(values)
```
