# CIDR_MATCH

The CIDR_MATCH function returns true if the given IP address is contained within any of the specified CIDR blocks.

## Syntax

`CIDR_MATCH(ip, blockX)`

### Parameters

#### ip

The IP address to check. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported.

#### blockX

One or more CIDR blocks to test the IP address against.

## Examples

The following query filters the `hosts` data to only include rows where the `ip1` field matches either of the two specified CIDR blocks ("127.0.0.2/32" or "127.0.0.3/32"). It then keeps only the `card`, `host`, `ip0`, and `ip1` fields in the output.

```esql
FROM hosts
| WHERE CIDR_MATCH(ip1, "127.0.0.2/32", "127.0.0.3/32")
| KEEP card, host, ip0, ip1
```
