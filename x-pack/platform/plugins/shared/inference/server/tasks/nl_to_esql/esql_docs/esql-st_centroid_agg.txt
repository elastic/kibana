### Parameters

#### field

The column containing spatial point geometry values to aggregate.

## Examples

Calculate the spatial centroid of airport locations:

This query retrieves data from the `airports` index and calculates the spatial centroid of all airport locations by aggregating the `location` field. The result is a single centroid point representing the average geographic center of all airport locations.
