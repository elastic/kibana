# TO_DATE_NANOS

Converts an input value to a nanosecond-resolution date value (date_nanos). The supported range is from 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z to 2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775807Z. Values outside this range will result in null with a warning. Integers cannot be converted into date nanos, as the integer nanosecond range only covers about 2 seconds after the epoch.

## Syntax

`TO_DATE_NANOS(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

Input value to convert. The input can be a single- or multi-valued column or an expression.

## Examples

This query selects data from the `date_nanos` index, filters for rows where the minimum value in the `nanos` column is less than the nanosecond date corresponding to `"2023-10-23T12:27:28.948Z"` and where the `millis` field is after `"2000-01-01"`. The results are then sorted by the `nanos` field in descending order.

```esql
FROM date_nanos
| WHERE MV_MIN(nanos) < TO_DATE_NANOS("2023-10-23T12:27:28.948Z")
    AND millis > "2000-01-01"
| SORT nanos DESC
```

Filter rows where the minimum value in the `nanos` column is less than the specified nanosecond date and `millis` is after January 1, 2000, then sort the results by `nanos` in descending order.

## Limitations

- The supported range for date nanos is 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z to 2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775807Z. Values outside this range will result in null with a warning.
- Integers cannot be converted into date nanos, as the integer nanosecond range only covers about 2 seconds after the epoch.
