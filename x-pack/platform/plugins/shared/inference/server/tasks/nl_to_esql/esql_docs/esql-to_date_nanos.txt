# TO_DATE_NANOS

Converts an input value to a nanosecond-resolution date value (date_nanos). The valid range for date nanos is from 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z to 2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775807Z. Attempting to convert values outside this range will result in null and a warning. Integers cannot be converted into date nanos, as the range of integer nanoseconds only covers about 2 seconds after the epoch.

## Syntax

`TO_DATE_NANOS(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The input value to convert. This can be a single- or multi-valued column or an expression.

## Examples

The following query compares the minimum value in a multi-valued `nanos` column to a specific nanosecond-resolution date, filters for rows where the `millis` field is after the year 2000, and sorts the results by the `nanos` field in descending order.

```esql
FROM date_nanos
| WHERE MV_MIN(nanos) < TO_DATE_NANOS("2023-10-23T12:27:28.948Z")
    AND millis > "2000-01-01"
| SORT nanos DESC
```

## Limitations

- The valid range for date nanos is 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z to 2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775807Z. Values outside this range will result in null and a warning.
- Integers cannot be converted into date nanos, as the integer nanosecond range only covers about 2 seconds after the epoch.
