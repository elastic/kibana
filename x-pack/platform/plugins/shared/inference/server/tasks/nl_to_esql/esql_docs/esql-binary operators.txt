### Equality

**Syntax**
`BINARY OPERATORS()`

Check if two fields are equal. If either field is multivalued then the result is `null`.
<note>
  This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant and the other side is a field in the index that has both an mapping-index and doc-values.
</note>

**Supported types**

### Inequality `!=`

Check if two fields are unequal. If either field is multivalued then the result is `null`.
<note>
  This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant and the other side is a field in the index that has both an mapping-index and doc-values.
</note>

**Supported types**

### Less than `<`

Check if one field is less than another. If either field is multivalued then the result is `null`.
<note>
  This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant and the other side is a field in the index that has both an mapping-index and doc-values.
</note>

**Supported types**

### Less than or equal to `<=`

Check if one field is less than or equal to another. If either field is multivalued then the result is `null`.
<note>
  This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant and the other side is a field in the index that has both an mapping-index and doc-values.
</note>

**Supported types**

### Greater than `>`

Check if one field is greater than another. If either field is multivalued then the result is `null`.
<note>
  This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant and the other side is a field in the index that has both an mapping-index and doc-values.
</note>

**Supported types**

### Greater than or equal to `>=`

Check if one field is greater than or equal to another. If either field is multivalued then the result is `null`.
<note>
  This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant and the other side is a field in the index that has both an mapping-index and doc-values.
</note>

**Supported types**

### Add `+`

Add two numbers together. If either field is multivalued then the result is `null`.
**Supported types**

### Subtract `-`

Subtract one number from another. If either field is multivalued then the result is `null`.
**Supported types**

### Multiply `*`

Multiply two numbers together. If either field is multivalued then the result is `null`.
**Supported types**

### Divide `/`

Divide one number by another. If either field is multivalued then the result is `null`.
<note>
  Division of two integer types will yield an integer result, rounding towards 0. If you need floating point division, `Cast (::)` one of the arguments to a `DOUBLE`.
</note>

**Supported types**

### Modulus `%`

Divide one number by another and return the remainder. If either field is multivalued then the result is `null`.
