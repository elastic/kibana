# BINARY OPERATORS

Binary operators perform comparisons and arithmetic operations between two fields or values. These include equality, inequality, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. If either field is multivalued, the result is `null`. For comparison operators, if one side is a constant and the other is a field with both a mapping-index and doc-values, the operation is pushed to the underlying search index.

## Syntax

`<field_or_value> <operator> <field_or_value>`

### Parameters

#### <field_or_value>

Represents the left or right operand for the binary operation. This can be a field or a constant value.

#### <operator>

The binary operator to apply. Supported operators are:
- `==` (equality)
- `!=` (inequality)
- `<` (less than)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)
- `>` (greater than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `+` (addition)
- `-` (subtraction)
- `*` (multiplication)
- `/` (division)
- `%` (modulus)

## Examples

Checks whether the values of `a` and `b` are equal and stores the result in `is_equal`.
```esql
ROW a = 5, b = 5
| EVAL is_equal = a == b
```

Checks whether the values of `a` and `b` are not equal and stores the result in `is_not_equal`.
```esql
ROW a = 5, b = 3
| EVAL is_not_equal = a != b
```

Checks if the value of `a` is less than the value of `b` and stores the result in `is_less`.
```esql
ROW a = 2, b = 5
| EVAL is_less = a < b
```

Checks if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `b` and stores the result in `is_greater_or_equal`.
```esql
ROW a = 7, b = 7
| EVAL is_greater_or_equal = a >= b
```

Adds the values of `a` and `b` and stores the result in `sum`.
```esql
ROW a = 2, b = 3
| EVAL sum = a + b
```

Subtracts the value of `b` from `a` and stores the result in `difference`.
```esql
ROW a = 5, b = 2
| EVAL difference = a - b
```

Multiplies the values of `a` and `b` and stores the result in `product`.
```esql
ROW a = 4, b = 3
| EVAL product = a * b
```

Divides the value of `a` by `b` and stores the result in `quotient`.
```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 2
| EVAL quotient = a / b
```

Divides the value of `a` by `b`, casts the result to a floating point value, and stores it in `quotient`.
```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 3
| EVAL quotient = a / b::DOUBLE
```

Calculates the remainder when `a` is divided by `b` and stores the result in `remainder`.
```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 3
| EVAL remainder = a % b
```

## Limitations

- If either operand is multivalued, the result of the binary operation is `null`.
- For division, dividing two integer types yields an integer result, rounded towards zero. To obtain a floating point result, cast one of the operands to `DOUBLE`.
- For comparison operators, the operation is pushed to the underlying search index only if one side is a constant and the other is a field with both a mapping-index and doc-values.
