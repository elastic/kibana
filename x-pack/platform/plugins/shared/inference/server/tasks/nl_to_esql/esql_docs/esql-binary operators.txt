# BINARY OPERATORS

Binary operators perform comparisons and arithmetic operations between two fields or values. These include equality, inequality, relational comparisons, and mathematical calculations. If either field is multivalued, the result is `null`. For comparison operators, if one side is a constant and the other is a field with both a mapping-index and doc-values, the operation is pushed to the underlying search index.

## Syntax

`<field_or_value> <operator> <field_or_value>`

### Parameters

#### field_or_value

Represents the left or right operand in the binary operation. This can be a field from your data or a constant value.

#### operator

The binary operator to apply. Supported operators include:
- Equality (`==`)
- Inequality (`!=`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)
- Greater than (`>`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Add (`+`)
- Subtract (`-`)
- Multiply (`*`)
- Divide (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`)

## Examples

Filter employees whose department is "Engineering".
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE department == "Engineering"
```

Filter employees whose status is not "inactive".
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE status != "inactive"
```

Filter employees younger than 30.
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE age < 30
```

Filter employees with 5 or fewer years of experience.
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE years_experience <= 5
```

Filter employees with a salary greater than 50,000.
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE salary > 50000
```

Filter employees who have completed at least 10 projects.
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE projects_completed >= 10
```

Calculate total compensation by adding salary and bonus.
```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL total_compensation = salary + bonus
```

Calculate remaining vacation days.
```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL remaining_vacation = vacation_days - vacation_taken
```

Calculate annual bonus by multiplying monthly bonus by 12.
```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL annual_bonus = monthly_bonus * 12
```

Calculate average monthly salary.
```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL average_monthly_salary = salary / 12
```

Determine if employee ID is odd or even.
```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL odd_even = employee_id % 2
```

## Limitations

- If either operand is multivalued, the result is `null`.
- For division (`/`), dividing two integer types yields an integer result, rounding towards 0. For floating point division, cast one of the arguments to `DOUBLE`.
- Comparison operators are pushed to the underlying search index only if one side is a constant and the other is a field with both a mapping-index and doc-values.
