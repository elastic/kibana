# BINARY OPERATORS

Binary operators perform comparisons and arithmetic operations between two fields or values. These include equality, inequality, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. If either operand is multivalued, the result is `null`. For comparison operators, if one side is a constant and the other is a field with both a mapping-index and doc-values, the operation is pushed to the underlying search index. For division, integer division rounds towards zero; use casting for floating point division.

## Syntax

`<field_or_value> <operator> <field_or_value>`

### Parameters

#### field_or_value

Represents the left or right operand in the binary operation.

#### operator

The binary operator to apply. Supported operators are:
- Equality (`==`)
- Inequality (`!=`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)
- Greater than (`>`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Add (`+`)
- Subtract (`-`)
- Multiply (`*`)
- Divide (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`)

## Examples

Determines if the values in columns `a` and `b` are equal.
```esql
ROW a = 5, b = 5
| EVAL is_equal = a == b
```

Determines if the values in columns `a` and `b` are not equal.
```esql
ROW a = 5, b = 3
| EVAL is_unequal = a != b
```

Checks if the value in column `a` is less than the value in column `b`.
```esql
ROW a = 2, b = 5
| EVAL is_less = a < b
```

Checks if the value in column `a` is less than or equal to the value in column `b`.
```esql
ROW a = 5, b = 5
| EVAL is_less_or_equal = a <= b
```

Checks if the value in column `a` is greater than the value in column `b`.
```esql
ROW a = 7, b = 5
| EVAL is_greater = a > b
```

Checks if the value in column `a` is greater than or equal to the value in column `b`.
```esql
ROW a = 5, b = 5
| EVAL is_greater_or_equal = a >= b
```

Adds the values in columns `a` and `b`.
```esql
ROW a = 2, b = 3
| EVAL sum = a + b
```

Subtracts the value in column `b` from the value in column `a`.
```esql
ROW a = 5, b = 3
| EVAL difference = a - b
```

Multiplies the values in columns `a` and `b`.
```esql
ROW a = 2, b = 3
| EVAL product = a * b
```

Divides the value in column `a` by the value in column `b`, rounding towards zero for integer types.
```esql
ROW a = 7, b = 2
| EVAL quotient = a / b
```

Calculates the remainder of dividing the value in column `a` by the value in column `b`.
```esql
ROW a = 7, b = 2
| EVAL remainder = a % b
```

## Limitations

- If either operand is multivalued, the result is `null`.
- For division, dividing two integer types yields an integer result, rounded towards zero. To obtain a floating point result, cast one of the operands to `DOUBLE`.
- For comparison operators, the operation is pushed to the underlying search index only if one side is a constant and the other is a field with both a mapping-index and doc-values.
