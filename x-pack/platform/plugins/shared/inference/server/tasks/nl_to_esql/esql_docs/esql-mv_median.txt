# MV_MEDIAN

The MV_MEDIAN function converts a multivalued field into a single valued field containing the median value. If the field contains an even number of values, the result is the average of the two middle values. For non-floating point columns, the average rounds down.

## Syntax

`MV_MEDIAN(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

A multivalue expression containing the values for which the median will be calculated.

## Examples

Calculates the median value from the array `[3, 5, 1]` and assigns it to the field `median_a`.

```esql
ROW a=[3, 5, 1]
| EVAL median_a = MV_MEDIAN(a)
```

Calculates the median value from the array `[3, 7, 1, 6]`, averaging the two middle values and rounding down if necessary, and assigns it to the field `median_a`.

```esql
ROW a=[3, 7, 1, 6]
| EVAL median_a = MV_MEDIAN(a)
```
