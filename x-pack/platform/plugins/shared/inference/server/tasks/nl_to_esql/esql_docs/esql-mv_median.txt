# MV_MEDIAN

The MV_MEDIAN function converts a multivalued field into a single value containing the median of the values. If the number of values is even, the result is the average of the two middle values. For non-floating point columns, the average is rounded down.

## Syntax

`MV_MEDIAN(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

A multivalue expression containing the values from which to calculate the median.

## Examples

This query creates a row with an array of values `[3, 5, 1]` and calculates the median value from that array, storing the result in the field `median_a`.

```esql
ROW a=[3, 5, 1]
| EVAL median_a = MV_MEDIAN(a)
```

This query creates a row with an array of values `[3, 7, 1, 6]` and calculates the median value. Since the array has an even number of elements, the result is the average of the two middle values (rounded down if not floating point), and the result is stored in the field `median_a`.

```esql
ROW a=[3, 7, 1, 6]
| EVAL median_a = MV_MEDIAN(a)
```
