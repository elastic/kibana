# MV_MEDIAN

The MV_MEDIAN function converts a multivalued field into a single valued field containing the median value. If the field has an even number of values, the result is the average of the middle two entries. For non-floating point columns, the average rounds down.

## Syntax

`MV_MEDIAN(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

A multivalue expression containing the values for which the median will be calculated.

## Examples

Calculate the median value from a list of numbers in a row:

This query creates a row with a field `a` containing the values `[3, 5, 1]`, then computes the median of those values and stores it in a new field called `median_a`.

```esql
ROW a=[3, 5, 1]
| EVAL median_a = MV_MEDIAN(a)
```

Calculate the median for a row with an even number of values; the result is the average of the middle two entries, rounded down for non-floating point columns:

This query creates a row with a field `a` containing the values `[3, 7, 1, 6]`, then calculates the median of those values. Since there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers (rounded down if not a floating point), and the result is stored in the field `median_a`.

```esql
ROW a=[3, 7, 1, 6]
| EVAL median_a = MV_MEDIAN(a)
```
