# MV_EXPAND

The `MV_EXPAND` command expands multivalued columns into one row per value, duplicating other columns.

## Syntax

`MV_EXPAND column`

### Parameters

#### column

The multivalued column to expand.

## Notes

The output rows produced by `MV_EXPAND` can be in any order and may not respect preceding `SORT` commands. To ensure a specific ordering, place a `SORT` command after any `MV_EXPAND` commands.

## Examples

```esql
ROW a=[1,2,3], b="b", j=["a","b"]
| MV_EXPAND a
```

This example expands the multivalued column `a` into separate rows, duplicating the values in columns `b` and `j`.
