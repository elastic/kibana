# MV_EXPAND

The MV_EXPAND command expands multivalued columns so that each value appears in its own row, duplicating the other columns for each expanded value.

## Syntax

`MV_EXPAND column`

### Parameters

#### column

The multivalued column to expand.

## Examples

Expands each value in the multivalued column `a` into its own row, while duplicating the values of columns `b` and `j` for each expanded value.

```esql
ROW a=[1,2,3], b="b", j=["a","b"]
| MV_EXPAND a
```

## Limitations

The output rows produced by MV_EXPAND can be in any order and may not respect preceding SORT commands. To guarantee a specific ordering, place a SORT after any MV_EXPAND commands.
