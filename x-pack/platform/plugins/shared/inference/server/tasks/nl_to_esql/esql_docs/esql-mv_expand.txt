# MV_EXPAND

The `MV_EXPAND` command expands multivalued columns into one row per value, duplicating other columns.

> **Note:** This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

## Syntax

`MV_EXPAND column`

### Parameters

#### column

The multivalued column to expand.

## Notes

The output rows produced by `MV_EXPAND` can be in any order and may not respect preceding `SORT` commands. To ensure a specific ordering, place a `SORT` command after any `MV_EXPAND` commands.


## Examples

```esql
ROW a=[1,2,3], b="b", j=["a","b"]
| MV_EXPAND a
```
Expand a multivalued column `a` into individual rows:

```esql
ROW a=[1,2,3], b="b", j=["a","b"]
| MV_EXPAND a
| MV_EXPAND j
```
Expand two multivalued columns `a` and `j` into individual rows:

```esql
ROW a=[1,2,3,4,5], b="b"
| MV_EXPAND a
| WHERE a > 2
```
Expand a multivalued column and then filtering the results:
