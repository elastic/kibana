## MV_EXPAND

The `MV_EXPAND` processing command expands multivalued columns into one row per value, duplicating other columns.

## Syntax

`MV_EXPAND column`

### Parameters

#### column

The multivalued column to expand.

*Note:* The output rows produced by `MV_EXPAND` can be in any order and may not respect preceding `SORT` commands. To ensure a specific order, apply a `SORT` command after using `MV_EXPAND`.

## Examples

Expand the multivalued column `a` into separate rows, duplicating the values in other columns:

```esql
ROW a=[1,2,3], b="b", j=["a","b"]
| MV_EXPAND a
```
