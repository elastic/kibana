# MV_EXPAND

The MV_EXPAND command expands multivalued columns so that each value appears in its own row, duplicating the other columns for each value.

## Syntax

`MV_EXPAND column`

### Parameters

#### column

The multivalued column to expand.

## Examples

This query takes a single row with multivalued columns and expands the column `a` so that each value in `a` (1, 2, and 3) appears in its own row. The other columns (`b` and `j`) are duplicated for each expanded value of `a`.

```esql
ROW a=[1,2,3], b="b", j=["a","b"]
| MV_EXPAND a
```

## Limitations

The output rows produced by MV_EXPAND can be in any order and may not respect preceding SORT commands. To guarantee a specific ordering, place a SORT after any MV_EXPAND commands.
