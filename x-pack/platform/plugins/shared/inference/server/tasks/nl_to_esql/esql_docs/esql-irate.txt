# IRATE

Calculates the irate of a counter field. The irate is the per-second rate of increase between the last two data points, making it highly responsive to recent changes in the rate of increase. Only the last two data points in each time period are considered.

## Syntax

`IRATE(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the irate for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the irate.

## Examples

The following query calculates the irate of the `network.total_bytes_in` metric for pods named "one", grouping the results by cluster and by 10-minute time buckets. This helps you see how quickly the total bytes in are increasing for each cluster over recent 10-minute intervals, focusing only on the most recent data points.

```esql
TS k8s | WHERE pod == "one"
| STATS irate_bytes_in = SUM(IRATE(network.total_bytes_in)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(10minute)
```
