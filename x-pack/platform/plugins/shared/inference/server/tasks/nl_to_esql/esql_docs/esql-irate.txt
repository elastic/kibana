# IRATE

Calculates the irate (instantaneous rate) of a counter field. The irate is the per-second rate of increase between the last two data points, making it more responsive to recent changes compared to the rate function.

## Syntax

`IRATE(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the irate for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the irate.

## Examples

Calculates the sum of the instantaneous rate of increase for the `network.total_bytes_in` field for pods named "one", grouped by cluster and 10-minute time buckets.

```esql
TS k8s | WHERE pod == "one"
| STATS irate_bytes_in = SUM(IRATE(network.total_bytes_in)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(10minute)
```
