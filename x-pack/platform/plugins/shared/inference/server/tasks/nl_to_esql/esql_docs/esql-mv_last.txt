# MV_LAST

The MV_LAST function converts a multivalue expression into a single-valued column containing the last value. This is especially useful when working with functions that produce multivalued columns in a known order, such as `SPLIT`. The order in which multivalued fields are read from storage is not guaranteed and is frequently ascending, but you should not rely on this. If you need the maximum value, use `MV_MAX` instead, as it is optimized for sorted values and offers better performance.

## Syntax

`MV_LAST(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

A multivalue expression to be reduced to its last value.

## Examples

Extract the last value from a semicolon-separated string:

This query creates a row with a field `a` containing the string "foo;bar;baz", splits this string into multiple values using the semicolon as a separator, and then extracts the last value from the resulting list (which would be "baz") into a new field called `last_a`.

```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL last_a = MV_LAST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```
