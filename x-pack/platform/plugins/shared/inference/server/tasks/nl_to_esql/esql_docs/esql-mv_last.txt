# MV_LAST

Converts a multivalue expression into a single-valued column containing the last value. This is particularly useful when working with functions that produce multivalued columns in a known order, such as `SPLIT`.

The order in which multivalued fields are read from underlying storage is not guaranteed. While it is often ascending, this behavior should not be relied upon. If you need the maximum value, use `MV_MAX` instead of `MV_LAST`. `MV_MAX` is optimized for sorted values and does not offer a performance advantage over `MV_LAST`.

## Syntax

`MV_LAST(field)`

### Parameters

#### `field`

A multivalue expression.

## Examples

### Example 1: Extracting the last value from a split string

The following example splits a string into multiple values and retrieves the last value:

```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL last_a = MV_LAST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```

## Limitations

- The order in which multivalued fields are read is not guaranteed. If you require a specific order, consider using other functions like `MV_MAX` for maximum values.
