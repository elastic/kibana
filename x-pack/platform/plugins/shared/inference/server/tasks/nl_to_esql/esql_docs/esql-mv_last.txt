# MV_LAST

Converts a multivalue expression into a single valued column containing the last value. This is most useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued columns in a known order like `SPLIT`.
The order that multivalued fields are read from
underlying storage is not guaranteed. It is

**Syntax**
`MV_LAST(field)`

### Parameters

#### `field`

Multivalue expression.

**frequently** ascending, but don’t
rely on that. If you need the maximum value use `MV_MAX` instead of
`MV_LAST`. `MV_MAX` has optimizations for sorted values so there isn’t a
performance benefit to `MV_LAST`.
**Supported types**

**Example**
```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL last_a = MV_LAST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```
