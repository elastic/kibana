# MV_LAST

The MV_LAST function converts a multivalue expression into a single-valued column containing the last value. This is especially useful when working with functions that produce multivalued columns in a known order, such as `SPLIT`. Note that the order in which multivalued fields are read from storage is not guaranteed and is frequently ascending, but you should not rely on this. If you need the maximum value, use `MV_MAX` instead, as it is optimized for sorted values and offers no performance benefit over MV_LAST.

## Syntax

`MV_LAST(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

A multivalue expression.

## Examples

Extract the last value from a semicolon-separated string:

This query creates a row with a column `a` containing the string "foo;bar;baz". It then splits the string by semicolons into multiple values and uses `MV_LAST` to select the last value from the resulting list, which is "baz".

```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL last_a = MV_LAST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```
This example splits the string in column `a` by semicolons and returns the last value, which is `baz`.
