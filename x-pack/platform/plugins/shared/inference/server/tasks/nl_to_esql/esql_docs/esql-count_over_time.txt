# COUNT_OVER_TIME

Calculates the count over time value for a specified field within a given time window.

## Syntax

`COUNT_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the value for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the count over time.

## Examples

Calculate the count over time for the `network.cost` field, grouped by cluster and 1-minute time buckets:

This query retrieves data from the `k8s` time series, calculates the count over time for the `network.cost` field, and then aggregates the results by `cluster` and 1-minute time intervals. The output shows the count of `network.cost` events for each cluster in each 1-minute bucket.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS count=COUNT(COUNT_OVER_TIME(network.cost))
  BY cluster, time_bucket = BUCKET(@timestamp,1minute)
```
