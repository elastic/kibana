# COUNT_OVER_TIME

Calculates the count over time value of a field within a specified time window.

## Syntax

`COUNT_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the value for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the count over time.

## Examples

The following query calculates the count over time for the `network.cost` field, grouping the results by `cluster` and by 1-minute time buckets. This helps you see how many `network.cost` events occurred in each cluster for every minute.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS count=COUNT(COUNT_OVER_TIME(network.cost))
  BY cluster, time_bucket = BUCKET(@timestamp,1minute)
```
