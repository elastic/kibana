# ST_ENVELOPE

Determines the minimum bounding box of the supplied geometry.

## Syntax

`ST_ENVELOPE(geometry)`

### Parameters

#### `geometry`

Expression of type `geo_point`, `geo_shape`, `cartesian_point`, or `cartesian_shape`. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Calculate the bounding box for a city boundary

```esql
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE abbrev == "CPH"
| EVAL envelope = ST_ENVELOPE(city_boundary)
| KEEP abbrev, airport, envelope
```

This example calculates the minimum bounding box for the city boundary of the airport with the abbreviation "CPH" and keeps the abbreviation, airport name, and the calculated bounding box.
