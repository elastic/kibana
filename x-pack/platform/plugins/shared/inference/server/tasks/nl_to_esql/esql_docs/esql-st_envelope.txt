# ST_ENVELOPE

The ST_ENVELOPE function determines the minimum bounding box of the supplied geometry.

## Syntax

`ST_ENVELOPE(geometry, point, point, point, point)`

### Parameters

#### geometry

Expression of type `geo_point`, `geo_shape`, `cartesian_point`, or `cartesian_shape`. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

Finds the minimum bounding box for the city boundary of Copenhagen airport and displays the abbreviation, airport name, and the bounding box.
```esql
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE abbrev == "CPH"
| EVAL envelope = ST_ENVELOPE(city_boundary)
| KEEP abbrev, airport, envelope
```

Calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates from the bounding box of Copenhagen airport's city boundary and displays them along with the abbreviation and airport name.
```esql
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE abbrev == "CPH"
| EVAL envelope = ST_ENVELOPE(city_boundary)
| EVAL xmin = ST_XMIN(envelope), xmax = ST_XMAX(envelope), ymin = ST_YMIN(envelope), ymax = ST_YMAX(envelope)
| KEEP abbrev, airport, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax
```
