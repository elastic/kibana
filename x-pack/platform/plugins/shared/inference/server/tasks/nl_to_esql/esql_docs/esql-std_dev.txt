# STD_DEV

Calculates the population standard deviation of a numeric field.

## Syntax

`STD_DEV(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

The numeric field or expression for which to calculate the population standard deviation.

## Examples

The following query calculates the population standard deviation of the `height` field for all employees. This helps you understand how much employee heights vary from the average.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS std_dev_height = STD_DEV(height)
```

This query calculates the population standard deviation of the maximum salary change for each employee. It first finds the maximum value in the `salary_change` field (if it contains multiple values) for each employee, and then computes how much these maximum salary changes vary across all employees.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS stddev_salary_change = STD_DEV(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```
