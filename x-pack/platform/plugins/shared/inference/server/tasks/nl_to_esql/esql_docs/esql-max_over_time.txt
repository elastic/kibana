# MAX_OVER_TIME

Calculates the maximum value of a field over a specified time window.

## Syntax

`MAX_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field for which to calculate the maximum value.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the maximum.

## Examples

Calculate the maximum network cost per cluster in 1-minute time buckets:

This query retrieves data from the `k8s` time series, calculates the maximum value of `network.cost` over each time window, sums these maximum values, and then groups the results by `cluster` and 1-minute time buckets.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS cost=SUM(MAX_OVER_TIME(network.cost)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(1minute)
```
