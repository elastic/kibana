# MAX_OVER_TIME

Calculates the maximum value of a field within a specified time window.

## Syntax

`MAX_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the maximum value for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the maximum.

## Examples

The following query calculates the maximum network cost per cluster in 1-minute time buckets. It first selects data from the `k8s` time series, then computes the sum of the maximum network cost over each 1-minute window, grouping the results by cluster and by each 1-minute time bucket.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS cost=SUM(MAX_OVER_TIME(network.cost)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(1minute)
```
