# EVAL

The EVAL command allows you to add new columns to your results with calculated values. You can use literals, expressions, or functions to define the values of these new columns.

## Syntax

`EVAL [column1 =] value1[, ..., [columnN =] valueN]`

### Parameters

#### columnX

The name of the column to add. If a column with the same name already exists, it will be replaced by the new column. If a column name is used more than once, only the rightmost one is kept.

#### valueX

The value to assign to the column. This can be a literal, an expression, or a function. You can reference columns defined to the left of the current one.

## Examples

Adds two new columns to the results: one converting the `height` field to feet and another converting it to centimeters.

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height_feet = height * 3.281, height_cm = height * 100
```

Replaces the existing `height` column with its value converted to feet.

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height = height * 3.281
```

Adds a new column to the results containing the value of `height` converted to feet, with the column name automatically set to the expression.

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height * 3.281
```

Calculates a new column by converting `height` to feet, then computes the average of that new column, referencing it by quoting the expression.

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL height * 3.281
| STATS avg_height_feet = AVG(`height * 3.281`)
```
