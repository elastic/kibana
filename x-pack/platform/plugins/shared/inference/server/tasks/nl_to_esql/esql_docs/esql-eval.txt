# EVAL

The EVAL command allows you to add new columns to your results by calculating values using expressions, literals, or functions. You can use existing columns or previously defined columns in your calculations.

## Syntax

`EVAL [column1 =] value1[, ..., [columnN =] valueN]`

### Parameters

#### columnX

The name of the column to be created. If a column with the same name already exists, it will be replaced by the new column. If a column name is used more than once, only the rightmost duplicate creates a column.

#### valueX

The value assigned to the column. This can be a literal, an expression, or a function. You can reference columns defined to the left of this one.

## Examples

Calculate height in feet and centimeters for each employee:

This query retrieves employee data, sorts it by employee number, keeps only the first name, last name, and height columns, and then adds two new columns: `height_feet`, which converts height to feet, and `height_cm`, which converts height to centimeters.

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height_feet = height * 3.281, height_cm = height * 100
```

Replace an existing column with a calculated value:

This query retrieves employee data, sorts it by employee number, keeps only the first name, last name, and height columns, and then replaces the `height` column with a new value that converts the height to feet.

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height = height * 3.281
```

Add a new column without specifying a name, resulting in a column named after the expression:

This query retrieves employee data, sorts it by employee number, keeps only the first name, last name, and height columns, and then adds a new column named after the expression `height * 3.281`, which contains the height converted to feet.

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height * 3.281
```

Reference a column with special characters in its name by quoting it with backticks:

This query retrieves employee data, calculates a new column `height * 3.281` (height in feet), and then computes the average of this column using the STATS command. The column name with special characters is referenced using backticks.

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL height * 3.281
| STATS avg_height_feet = AVG(`height * 3.281`)
```
