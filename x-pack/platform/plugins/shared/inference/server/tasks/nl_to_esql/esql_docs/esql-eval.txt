# EVAL

The `EVAL` processing command enables you to append new columns with calculated
values. `EVAL` supports various functions for calculating values. Refer to
Functions for more information.

The `EVAL` processing command enables you to append new columns with calculated
values.
**Syntax**
```esql
EVAL [column1 =] value1[, ..., [columnN =] valueN]
```

### Parameters

#### `columnX`

The column name.
 If a column with the same name already exists, the existing column is dropped.
 If a column name is used more than once, only the rightmost duplicate creates a column.

#### `valueX`

The value for the column. Can be a literal, an expression, or a
 function.
 Can use columns defined left of this one.

**Examples**
```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height_feet = height * 3.281, height_cm = height * 100
```

If the specified column already exists, the existing column will be dropped, and
the new column will be appended to the table:
```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height = height * 3.281
```

Specifying the output column name is optional. If not specified, the new column
name is equal to the expression. The following query adds a column named
`height*3.281`:
```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height * 3.281
```

Because this name contains special characters,
it needs to be quoted
with backticks (```) when using it in subsequent commands:
```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL height * 3.281
| STATS avg_height_feet = AVG(`height * 3.281`)
```
