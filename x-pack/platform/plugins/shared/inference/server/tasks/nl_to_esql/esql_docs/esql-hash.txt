Calculate the MD5 and SHA-256 hashes of the `message` field for all records where the message is not "Connection error":

```esql
FROM sample_data
| WHERE message != "Connection error"
| EVAL md5 = hash("md5", message), sha256 = hash("sha256", message)
| KEEP message, md5, sha256
```
This query retrieves records from `sample_data` where the `message` is not "Connection error", computes both MD5 and SHA-256 hashes of the `message` field, and displays the original message along with its hashes.
