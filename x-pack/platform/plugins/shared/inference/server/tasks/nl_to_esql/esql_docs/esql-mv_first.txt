# MV_FIRST

Converts a multivalued expression into a single valued column containing the first value. This is most useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued columns in a known order like `SPLIT`.
The order that multivalued fields are read from
underlying storage is not guaranteed. It is

**Syntax**
`MV_FIRST(field)`

### Parameters

#### `field`

Multivalue expression.

**frequently** ascending, but don’t
rely on that. If you need the minimum value use `MV_MIN` instead of
`MV_FIRST`. `MV_MIN` has optimizations for sorted values so there isn’t a
performance benefit to `MV_FIRST`.
**Supported types**

**Example**
```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL first_a = MV_FIRST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```
