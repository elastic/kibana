# MV_FIRST

The MV_FIRST function converts a multivalued expression into a single-valued column containing the first value. This is especially useful when working with functions that produce multivalued columns in a known order, such as `SPLIT`. Note that the order in which multivalued fields are read from storage is not guaranteed and is often ascending, but this should not be relied upon. If you need the minimum value, use `MV_MIN` instead, as it is optimized for sorted values and offers no performance benefit over `MV_FIRST`.

## Syntax

`MV_FIRST(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

A multivalue expression.

## Examples

Extract the first value from a semicolon-separated string:

```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL first_a = MV_FIRST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```
Splits the value in column `a` into multiple values using semicolons as separators, then selects only the first value and assigns it to `first_a`.
