# MV_FIRST

Converts a multivalued expression into a single-valued column containing the first value. This is particularly useful when working with functions that produce multivalued columns in a known order, such as `SPLIT`.

The order in which multivalued fields are read from underlying storage is not guaranteed. While it is often ascending, this behavior should not be relied upon. If you need the minimum value, use `MV_MIN` instead, as it is optimized for sorted values and offers no performance advantage over `MV_FIRST`.

## Syntax

`MV_FIRST(field)`

### Parameters

#### `field`

A multivalued expression.

## Examples

### Example 1: Extracting the first value from a split string

```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL first_a = MV_FIRST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```

This example splits the string `a` into multiple values using the `SPLIT` function and extracts the first value, resulting in `first_a = "foo"`.
