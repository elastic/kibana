# MV_FIRST

The MV_FIRST function converts a multivalued expression into a single-valued column containing the first value. This is especially useful when working with functions that produce multivalued columns in a known order, such as `SPLIT`. The order in which multivalued fields are read from storage is not guaranteed and is frequently ascending, but you should not rely on this. If you need the minimum value, use `MV_MIN` instead, as it is optimized for sorted values and offers no performance benefit over MV_FIRST.

## Syntax

`MV_FIRST(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

A multivalue expression.

## Examples

Extract the first value from a semicolon-separated string:

This query creates a row with a field `a` containing the string "foo;bar;baz", splits this string into multiple values using the semicolon as a separator, and then extracts the first value from the resulting list into a new column called `first_a`.

```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL first_a = MV_FIRST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```
