# MV_COUNT

The MV_COUNT function converts a multivalued expression into a single-valued column that contains the count of values.

## Syntax

`MV_COUNT(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The multivalue expression to count the number of values in.

## Examples

Count the number of values in a multivalued column:

This query creates a row with a column `a` containing three values: "foo", "zoo", and "bar". It then calculates how many values are present in `a` using the `MV_COUNT` function, and stores the result in a new column called `count_a`.

```esql
ROW a=["foo", "zoo", "bar"]
| EVAL count_a = MV_COUNT(a)
```
