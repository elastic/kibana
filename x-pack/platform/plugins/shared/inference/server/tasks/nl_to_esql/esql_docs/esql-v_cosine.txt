# V_COSINE

Calculates the cosine similarity between two dense_vectors.

## Syntax

`V_COSINE(left, right)`

### Parameters

#### left

The first dense_vector to calculate cosine similarity.

#### right

The second dense_vector to calculate cosine similarity.

## Examples

This query retrieves all records from the `colors` index where the color is not "black". It then calculates the cosine similarity between each record's `rgb_vector` and the vector `[0, 255, 255]`, storing the result in a new column called `similarity`. Finally, it sorts the results by similarity in descending order and by color in ascending order.

```esql
from colors
| where color != "black"
| eval similarity = v_cosine(rgb_vector, [0, 255, 255])
| sort similarity desc, color asc
```
