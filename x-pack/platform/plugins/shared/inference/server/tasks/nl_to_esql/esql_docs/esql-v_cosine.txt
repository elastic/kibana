# V_COSINE

Calculates the cosine similarity between two dense_vectors.

## Syntax

`V_COSINE(left, right)`

### Parameters

#### left

The first dense_vector used to calculate cosine similarity.

#### right

The second dense_vector used to calculate cosine similarity.

## Examples

This query calculates the cosine similarity between the `rgb_vector` column and the vector `[0, 255, 255]` for each row in the `colors` index, excluding rows where the color is "black". It then sorts the results first by similarity in descending order (most similar first), and then by color in ascending order.

```esql
from colors
| where color != "black"
| eval similarity = v_cosine(rgb_vector, [0, 255, 255])
| sort similarity desc, color asc
```
