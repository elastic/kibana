Calculates the cosine similarity between the `rgb_vector` column and the vector `[0, 255, 255]` for each color except black, then sorts the results by highest similarity and alphabetically by color.

```esql
from colors
| where color != "black"
| eval similarity = v_cosine(rgb_vector, [0, 255, 255])
| sort similarity desc, color asc
```
