# ROW

The ROW command creates a row with one or more columns and values that you specify. This is useful for testing or generating sample data.

## Syntax

`ROW column1 = value1[, ..., columnN = valueN]`

### Parameters

#### columnX

The column name. If there are duplicate column names, only the rightmost duplicate creates a column.

#### valueX

The value assigned to the column. This can be a literal, an expression, or a function.

## Examples

This query creates a row with three columns: `a` with value 1, `b` with value "two", and `c` with a null value.

```esql
ROW a = 1, b = "two", c = null
```

This query creates a row with a single column `a`, which contains a multi-value array with the values 2 and 1.

```esql
ROW a = [2, 1]
```

This query creates a row with column `a` set to the result of rounding 1.23 to 0 decimal places, which results in the value 1.

```esql
ROW a = ROUND(1.23, 0)
```
