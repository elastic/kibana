# ROW

The ROW command creates a single row with one or more columns, each assigned a value you specify. This is useful for testing or generating example data.

## Syntax

`ROW column1 = value1[, ..., columnN = valueN]`

### Parameters

#### columnX

The name of the column. If duplicate column names are provided, only the rightmost duplicate creates a column.

#### valueX

The value assigned to the column. This can be a literal, an expression, or a function.

## Examples

The following query creates a single row with three columns: `a` is assigned the integer value 1, `b` is assigned the string "two", and `c` is assigned a null value.

```esql
ROW a = 1, b = "two", c = null
```

This query creates a single row with one column `a`, which contains a multi-value array with the values 2 and 1.

```esql
ROW a = [2, 1]
```

This query creates a single row with one column `a`, where the value is the result of rounding 1.23 to zero decimal places (resulting in 1).

```esql
ROW a = ROUND(1.23, 0)
```
