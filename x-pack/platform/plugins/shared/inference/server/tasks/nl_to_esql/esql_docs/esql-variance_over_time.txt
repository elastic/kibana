# VARIANCE_OVER_TIME

Calculates the population variance over time for a numeric field within a specified time window.

## Syntax

`VARIANCE_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the variance for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the variance.

## Examples

Calculates the average variance of network cost for each cluster, grouped by one-minute time buckets.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS avg_var_cost=AVG(VARIANCE_OVER_TIME(network.cost)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(1minute)
```
