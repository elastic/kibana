# ENRICH

The ENRICH command allows you to add data from existing indices as new columns using an enrich policy. This is useful for augmenting your results with additional information from other datasets. Before using ENRICH, you must create and execute an enrich policy.

## Syntax

`ENRICH policy [ON match_field] [WITH [new_name1 = ]field1, [new_name2 = ]field2, ...]`

### Parameters

#### policy

The name of the enrich policy. You need to create and execute the enrich policy first.

#### mode

(Optional) The mode of the enrich command in cross cluster usage.

#### match_field

(Optional) The column used to match records in the enrich index. If not specified, the match is performed on the column with the same name as the match_field defined in the enrich policy.

#### fieldX

(Optional) The enrich fields from the enrich index that are added to the result as new columns. If a column with the same name as the enrich field already exists, it will be replaced by the new column. If not specified, all enrich fields defined in the policy are added.

#### new_nameX

(Optional) Allows you to rename the column that’s added for each enrich field. Defaults to the enrich field name. If a column has the same name as the new name, it will be discarded. If a name (new or original) occurs more than once, only the rightmost duplicate creates a new column.

## Examples

Add enrich fields defined in the policy using the default match field:

This query creates a single row with a column `language_code` set to `"1"`, then uses the `languages_policy` enrich policy to add additional columns from the enrich index, matching on the `language_code` column.

```esql
ROW language_code = "1"
| ENRICH languages_policy
```

Use a different column as the match field:

This query creates a row with a column `a` set to `"1"`, then enriches the data using the `languages_policy` policy, matching records based on the value in the `a` column instead of the default match field.

```esql
ROW a = "1"
| ENRICH languages_policy ON a
```

Select specific enrich fields to add:

This query creates a row with a column `a` set to `"1"`, then enriches the data using the `languages_policy` policy, matching on column `a` and adding only the `language_name` field from the enrich index.

```esql
ROW a = "1"
| ENRICH languages_policy ON a WITH language_name
```

Rename the added enrich field column:

This query creates a row with a column `a` set to `"1"`, then enriches the data using the `languages_policy` policy, matching on column `a` and adding the `language_name` field from the enrich index as a new column named `name`.

```esql
ROW a = "1"
| ENRICH languages_policy ON a WITH name = language_name
```

In case of name collisions, the newly created columns will override existing columns.
