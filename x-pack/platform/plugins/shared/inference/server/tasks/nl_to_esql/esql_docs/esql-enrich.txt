# ENRICH

The ENRICH command adds data from existing indices as new columns using an enrich policy. This allows you to augment your data with additional information from other sources. Before using ENRICH, you must create and execute an enrich policy.

## Syntax

`ENRICH policy [ON match_field] [WITH [new_name1 = ]field1, [new_name2 = ]field2, ...]`

### Parameters

#### policy

The name of the enrich policy. You must create and execute the enrich policy before using it.

#### mode

(Optional) The mode of the enrich command in cross-cluster scenarios.

#### match_field

(Optional) The column whose value is used to look for records in the enrich index. If not specified, the match is performed on the column with the same name as the match_field defined in the enrich policy.

#### fieldX

The enrich fields from the enrich index that are added as new columns. If a column with the same name as the enrich field already exists, it will be replaced. If not specified, all enrich fields defined in the policy are added. Columns with the same name as the enrich field will be dropped unless the enrich field is renamed.

#### new_nameX

(Optional) Allows you to rename the column that is added for each enrich field. Defaults to the enrich field name. If a column has the same name as the new name, it will be discarded. If a name (new or original) occurs more than once, only the rightmost duplicate creates a new column.

## Examples

Enriches a row with additional columns from the `languages_policy` policy, matching on the `language_code` column.

```esql
ROW language_code = "1"
| ENRICH languages_policy
```

Enriches a row using the value in column `a` as the match field for the `languages_policy` policy.

```esql
ROW a = "1"
| ENRICH languages_policy ON a
```

Enriches a row and adds only the `language_name` field from the `languages_policy` policy as a new column.

```esql
ROW a = "1"
| ENRICH languages_policy ON a WITH language_name
```

Enriches a row and adds the `language_name` field from the `languages_policy` policy as a new column named `name`.

```esql
ROW a = "1"
| ENRICH languages_policy ON a WITH name = language_name
```
