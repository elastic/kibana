# MV_INTERSECTION

The MV_INTERSECTION function returns the values that appear in both input fields. If either field is null or if no values match, it returns `null`.

## Syntax

`MV_INTERSECTION(field1, field2)`

### Parameters

#### field1

Multivalue expression. If null, the function returns null.

#### field2

Multivalue expression. If null, the function returns null.

## Examples

Find the intersection of two arrays of integers:

This query creates two arrays of integers, `a` and `b`, and then computes the values that are present in both arrays. The result is stored in the `finalValue` field and only this field is kept in the output.

```esql
ROW a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], b = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
| EVAL finalValue = MV_INTERSECTION(a, b)
| KEEP finalValue
```

Find the intersection of two arrays of long integers:

This query defines two arrays of long integers, `a` and `b`, and calculates their intersection. The resulting values that appear in both arrays are stored in `finalValue` and displayed.

```esql
ROW a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]::long, b = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]::long
| EVAL finalValue = MV_INTERSECTION(a, b)
| KEEP finalValue
```

Find the intersection of boolean arrays:

This query creates two boolean arrays, `a` and `b`, and finds the values that are present in both arrays. The intersection is stored in `finalValue` and shown in the output.

```esql
ROW a = [true, false, false, false], b = [false]
| EVAL finalValue = MV_INTERSECTION(a, b)
| KEEP finalValue
```

Find the intersection of floating point arrays:

This query defines two arrays of floating point numbers, `a` and `b`, and computes the intersection of these arrays. The shared values are stored in `finalValue` and returned.

```esql
ROW a = [5.2, 10.5, 1.12345, 2.6928], b = [10.5, 2.6928]
| EVAL finalValue = MV_INTERSECTION(a, b)
| KEEP finalValue
```

Find the intersection of string arrays:

This query creates two arrays of strings, `a` and `b`, and determines which values are present in both arrays. The intersection is stored in `finalValue` and displayed.

```esql
ROW a = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"], b = ["one", "four"]
| EVAL finalValue = MV_INTERSECTION(a, b)
| KEEP finalValue
```
