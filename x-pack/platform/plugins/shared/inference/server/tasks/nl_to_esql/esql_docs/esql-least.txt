## LEAST

Returns the minimum value from multiple columns. This function is similar to `MV_MIN` but is designed to operate on multiple columns simultaneously.

## Syntax

`LEAST(first, rest)`

### Parameters

#### `first`

The first column to evaluate.

#### `rest`

The remaining columns to evaluate.

## Examples

```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 20
| EVAL l = LEAST(a, b)
```

This example calculates the minimum value between columns `a` and `b`.
