# LEAST

The LEAST function returns the minimum value from multiple columns. It is designed to evaluate several columns at once, similar to `MV_MIN` but operates across columns rather than multiple values within a single column.

## Syntax

`LEAST(first, rest)`

### Parameters

#### first

The first column to evaluate.

#### rest

The remaining columns to evaluate.

## Examples

Calculate the minimum value between two columns:

This query creates a row with two columns, `a` and `b`, assigned the values 10 and 20 respectively. It then uses the `LEAST` function to compute the minimum value between `a` and `b`, storing the result in a new column called `l`.

```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 20
| EVAL l = LEAST(a, b)
```
