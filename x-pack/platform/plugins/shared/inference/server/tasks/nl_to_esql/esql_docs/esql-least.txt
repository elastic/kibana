# LEAST

The LEAST function returns the minimum value from multiple columns. It is designed to evaluate several columns at once, similar to `MV_MIN` but operates across columns rather than within multi-value fields.

## Syntax

`LEAST(first, rest)`

### Parameters

#### first

The first column to evaluate.

#### rest

The remaining columns to evaluate.

## Examples

Calculates the smallest value between columns `a` and `b` and stores it in column `l`.

```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 20
| EVAL l = LEAST(a, b)
```
