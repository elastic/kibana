# LEAST

The LEAST function returns the minimum value from multiple columns. It is similar to `MV_MIN`, but is designed to operate across several columns at once.

## Syntax

`LEAST(first, rest)`

### Parameters

#### first

The first column to evaluate.

#### rest

The remaining columns to evaluate.

## Examples

This query creates a row with columns `a` set to 10 and `b` set to 20, then adds a new column `l` containing the minimum value between `a` and `b`.

```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 20
| EVAL l = LEAST(a, b)
```
