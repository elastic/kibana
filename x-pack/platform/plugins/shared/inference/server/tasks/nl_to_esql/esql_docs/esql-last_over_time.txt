# LAST_OVER_TIME

Calculates the latest value of a field, with recency determined by the `@timestamp` field.

## Syntax

`LAST_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the latest value for.

#### window

The time window over which to find the latest value.

## Examples

The following query calculates the maximum value of the most recent `network.cost` for each cluster and each 1-minute time bucket. It first retrieves data from the `k8s` source, then uses the `LAST_OVER_TIME` function to get the latest `network.cost` value, and finally computes the maximum of these values grouped by `cluster` and by 1-minute intervals.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS max_cost=MAX(LAST_OVER_TIME(network.cost)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(1minute)
```
