## Syntax

## Supported Types

This function can be used with any column type, including `keyword` columns. For `keyword` columns, it selects the first string by comparing their UTF-8 representation byte by byte.

## Examples

#```esql
ROW a=[2, 1]
| EVAL min_a = MV_MIN(a)
```

#```esql
FROM bag_of_numbers
| EVAL min = MV_MIN(numbers)
```
