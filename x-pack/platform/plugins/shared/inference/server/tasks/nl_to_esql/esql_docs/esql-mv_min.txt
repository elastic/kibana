# MV_MIN

The MV_MIN function converts a multivalued expression into a single-valued column containing the minimum value. For string columns, it selects the first string based on their UTF-8 byte representation.

## Syntax

`MV_MIN(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

A multivalue expression to be reduced to its minimum value.

## Examples

Calculates the minimum value from the array `[2, 1]` and stores it in the column `min_a`.

```esql
ROW a=[2, 1]
| EVAL min_a = MV_MIN(a)
```

Finds the minimum string value from the array `["foo", "bar"]` by comparing their UTF-8 byte representations and stores it in `min_a`.

```esql
ROW a=["foo", "bar"]
| EVAL min_a = MV_MIN(a)
```
