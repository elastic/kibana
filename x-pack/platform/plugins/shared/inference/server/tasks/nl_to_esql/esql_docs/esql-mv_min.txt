# MV_MIN

The MV_MIN function converts a multivalued expression into a single valued column containing the minimum value.

## Syntax

`MV_MIN(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The multivalue expression to be evaluated.

## Examples

Calculate the minimum value from a list of numbers:

This query creates a row with a multivalued field `a` containing the numbers 2 and 1, then computes the minimum value in `a` and stores it in a new column called `min_a`.

```esql
ROW a=[2, 1]
| EVAL min_a = MV_MIN(a)
```

Find the minimum value from a list of strings by comparing their utf-8 representation byte by byte:

This query creates a row with a multivalued field `a` containing the strings "foo" and "bar", then determines the minimum string based on their UTF-8 byte values and stores it in a new column called `min_a`.

```esql
ROW a=["foo", "bar"]
| EVAL min_a = MV_MIN(a)
```
