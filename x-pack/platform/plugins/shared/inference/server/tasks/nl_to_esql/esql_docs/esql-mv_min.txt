# MV_MIN

Converts a multivalued expression into a single-valued column containing the minimum value.

## Syntax

`MV_MIN(field)`

### Parameters

#### `field`

A multivalued expression.

## Supported Types

This function can be used with any column type, including `keyword` columns. For `keyword` columns, it selects the first string by comparing their UTF-8 representation byte by byte.

## Examples

### Example 1

```esql
ROW a=[2, 1]
| EVAL min_a = MV_MIN(a)
```

Finds the minimum value in the multivalued column `a`, which contains numeric values.

### Example 2

```esql
ROW a=["foo", "bar"]
| EVAL min_a = MV_MIN(a)
```

Finds the minimum value in the multivalued column `a`, which contains string values. The comparison is based on the UTF-8 byte-by-byte representation.
