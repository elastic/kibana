# SUM

The SUM function calculates the total of a numeric expression.

## Syntax

`SUM(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

The numeric expression to be summed. Inline functions can be used within this parameter.

## Examples

Calculate the sum of the `languages` column:

This query retrieves all records from the `employees` index and calculates the total sum of the values in the `languages` column.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS SUM(languages)
```

Calculate the sum of each employee’s maximum salary changes using the `MV_MAX` function:

This query retrieves all records from the `employees` index, computes the maximum value in the `salary_change` field for each record (using `MV_MAX`), and then calculates the total sum of these maximum salary changes across all employees. The result is stored in a column named `total_salary_changes`.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS total_salary_changes = SUM(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```
