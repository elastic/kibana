## Examples

Calculate the sum of the `languages` field for all employees:

This query retrieves all records from the `employees` index and calculates the total sum of the `languages` field across all employees.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS SUM(languages)
```

Calculate the sum of each employee’s maximum salary changes by applying the `MV_MAX` function to each row and then summing the results:

This query retrieves all records from the `employees` index, finds the maximum value in the `salary_change` field for each employee (if it contains multiple values), and then calculates the total sum of these maximum salary changes across all employees.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS total_salary_changes = SUM(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```
