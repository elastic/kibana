# V_DOT_PRODUCT

Calculates the dot product between two dense_vectors.

## Syntax

`V_DOT_PRODUCT(left, right)`

### Parameters

#### left

The first dense_vector used to calculate the dot product similarity.

#### right

The second dense_vector used to calculate the dot product similarity.

## Examples

Calculates the dot product similarity between the `rgb_vector` column and the vector `[0, 255, 255]`, then sorts the results by similarity in descending order and color in ascending order.

```esql
from colors
| eval similarity = v_dot_product(rgb_vector, [0, 255, 255])
| sort similarity desc, color asc
```
