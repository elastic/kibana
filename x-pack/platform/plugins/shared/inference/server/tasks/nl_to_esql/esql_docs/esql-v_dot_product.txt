# V_DOT_PRODUCT

Calculates the dot product between two dense_vectors.

## Syntax

`V_DOT_PRODUCT(left, right)`

### Parameters

#### left

The first dense_vector to use in the dot product calculation.

#### right

The second dense_vector to use in the dot product calculation.

## Examples

This query calculates the dot product similarity between the `rgb_vector` column and the vector `[0, 255, 255]` for each row in the `colors` table. It then sorts the results by the computed similarity in descending order (showing the most similar colors first) and by the color name in ascending order.

```esql
from colors
| eval similarity = v_dot_product(rgb_vector, [0, 255, 255])
| sort similarity desc, color asc
```
