# TO_DOUBLE

Converts an input value to a double value. If the input is a date type, its value is interpreted as milliseconds since the Unix epoch and converted to double. Boolean `true` is converted to `1.0`, and `false` to `0.0`.

## Syntax

`TO_DOUBLE(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

The input value to convert. This can be a single- or multi-valued column or an expression.

## Examples

This query demonstrates how to convert string representations of numbers to double values. It creates a row with two string fields, then uses the `TO_DOUBLE` function to convert a numeric string, a scientific notation string, and a non-numeric string to double values. If the conversion is not possible (as with `"foo"`), the result is `null` and a warning header is added to the response indicating the failure.

```esql
ROW str1 = "5.20128E11", str2 = "foo"
| EVAL dbl = TO_DOUBLE("520128000000"), dbl1 = TO_DOUBLE(str1), dbl2 = TO_DOUBLE(str2)
```
