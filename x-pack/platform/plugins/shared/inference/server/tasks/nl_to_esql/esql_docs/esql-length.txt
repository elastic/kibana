# LENGTH

Returns the character length of a string. All strings are in UTF-8, so a single character can use multiple bytes.

## Syntax

`LENGTH(string)`

### Parameters

#### string

String expression to measure the length of. If the value is `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

This query retrieves all airports in India, keeps only the city name, and then calculates the number of characters in each city name, storing the result in a new column called `fn_length`:

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE country == "India"
| KEEP city
| EVAL fn_length = LENGTH(city)
```
