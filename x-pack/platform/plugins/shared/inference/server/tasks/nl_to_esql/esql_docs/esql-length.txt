# LENGTH

Returns the character length of a string.

**Note:** All strings are in UTF-8, so a single character can use multiple bytes.

## Syntax

`LENGTH(string)`

### Parameters

#### `string`

String expression. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE country == "India"
| KEEP city

```

This example calculates the character length of the `city` field for airports located in India.
