# MV_ZIP

The MV_ZIP function combines the values from two multivalued fields, joining them together with a specified delimiter.

## Syntax

`MV_ZIP(string1, string2, delim)`

### Parameters

#### string1

A multivalue expression representing the first set of values to combine.

#### string2

A multivalue expression representing the second set of values to combine.

#### delim

Optional. The delimiter used to join the values from the two fields. If omitted, a comma (`,`) is used by default.

## Examples

The following query creates two multivalued fields, `a` and `b`, and then combines their corresponding elements using a hyphen (`-`) as the delimiter. The result is stored in a new field `c`, and only the fields `a`, `b`, and `c` are kept in the output.

```esql
ROW a = ["x", "y", "z"], b = ["1", "2"]
| EVAL c = mv_zip(a, b, "-")
| KEEP a, b, c
```
