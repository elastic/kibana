# ST_INTERSECTS

Returns true if two geometries intersect. They intersect if they have any point in common, including their interior points (points along lines or within polygons). This is the inverse of the ST_DISJOINT function. In mathematical terms: ST_Intersects(A, B) ⇔ A ⋂ B ≠ ∅

## Syntax

`ST_INTERSECTS(geomA, geomB)`

### Parameters

#### geomA

Expression of type `geo_point`, `cartesian_point`, `geo_shape` or `cartesian_shape`. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### geomB

Expression of type `geo_point`, `cartesian_point`, `geo_shape` or `cartesian_shape`. If `null`, the function returns `null`. The second parameter must also have the same coordinate system as the first. This means it is not possible to combine `geo_*` and `cartesian_*` parameters.

## Examples

Check if airport locations intersect with a given polygon:

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE ST_INTERSECTS(location, TO_GEOSHAPE("POLYGON((42 14, 43 14, 43 15, 42 15, 42 14))"))
```

## Limitations

- Both parameters must use the same coordinate system; mixing `geo_*` and `cartesian_*` types is not supported.
- If either parameter is `null`, the function returns `null`.
