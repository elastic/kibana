# ST_INTERSECTS

Determines whether two geometries intersect. Two geometries intersect if they share any point in common, including interior points such as those along lines or within polygons. This function is the inverse of `ST_DISJOINT`.

## Syntax

`ST_INTERSECTS(geomA, geomB)`

### Parameters

#### geomA

Expression of type `geo_point`, `cartesian_point`, `geo_shape`, or `cartesian_shape`. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### geomB

Expression of type `geo_point`, `cartesian_point`, `geo_shape`, or `cartesian_shape`. If `null`, the function returns `null`. The second parameter must use the same coordinate system as the first. Combining `geo_*` and `cartesian_*` parameters is not allowed.

## Examples

### Example 1: Filtering airports within a polygon

The following query filters airports whose locations intersect with a specified polygon:

```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE ST_INTERSECTS(location, TO_GEOSHAPE("POLYGON((42 14, 43 14, 43 15, 42 15, 42 14))"))
```

## Limitations

- The two geometries must use the same coordinate system. For example, you cannot mix `geo_*` and `cartesian_*` types.
