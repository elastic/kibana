# SUBSTRING

The SUBSTRING function extracts a portion of a string, starting from a specified position and optionally for a given length.

## Syntax

`SUBSTRING(string, start, length)`

### Parameters

#### string

The string expression to extract the substring from. If the value is `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### start

The position to start extracting the substring.

#### length

Optional. The number of characters to extract from the start position. If omitted, all characters after the start position are returned.

## Examples

Return the first three characters of every last name:

This query selects the `last_name` field from the `employees` data, and then creates a new field `ln_sub` containing the first three characters of each last name.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP last_name
| EVAL ln_sub = SUBSTRING(last_name, 1, 3)
```

Return the last three characters of every last name using a negative start position:

This query selects the `last_name` field from the `employees` data, and then creates a new field `ln_sub` containing the last three characters of each last name by starting the substring three characters from the end.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP last_name
| EVAL ln_sub = SUBSTRING(last_name, -3, 3)
```

Return all characters except for the first by omitting the length parameter:

This query selects the `last_name` field from the `employees` data, and then creates a new field `ln_sub` containing all characters of each last name except for the first character.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP last_name
| EVAL ln_sub = SUBSTRING(last_name, 2)
```
