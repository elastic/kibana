# SUBSTRING

Returns a substring from a string, based on a specified start position and an optional length.

## Syntax

`SUBSTRING(string, start, length)`

### Parameters

#### string

The string expression to extract the substring from. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### start

The position to start extracting the substring.

#### length

(Optional) The number of characters to extract from the start position. If omitted, all characters after `start` are returned.

## Examples

The following query returns the first three characters of every last name in the employees dataset:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP last_name
| EVAL ln_sub = SUBSTRING(last_name, 1, 3)
```

This query returns the last three characters of every last name by using a negative start position, which counts from the end of the string:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP last_name
| EVAL ln_sub = SUBSTRING(last_name, -3, 3)
```

This query returns all characters of each last name except for the first character, by omitting the length parameter so that the substring starts at the second character and continues to the end:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP last_name
| EVAL ln_sub = SUBSTRING(last_name, 2)
```
