# CLAMP_MAX

The CLAMP_MAX function limits all input sample values to an upper bound specified by `max`. Any value above `max` is reduced to `max`.

## Syntax

`CLAMP_MAX(field, max)`

### Parameters

#### field

The field whose values you want to clamp.

#### max

The upper bound to which values are clamped.

## Examples

Calculates the sum of network costs per minute, applying different clamping functions to restrict values within specified bounds.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS full_clamped_cost=sum(clamp(network.cost, 1, 2)), clamped_cost=sum(clamp_max(network.cost, 1)), clamped_min_cost=sum(clamp_min(network.cost, 10)) BY time_bucket = bucket(@timestamp,1minute)
```
