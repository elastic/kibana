# MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION

The `MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION` function calculates the median absolute deviation, a robust measure of variability. It is particularly useful for datasets with outliers or non-normal distributions, as it can provide a more descriptive measure of variability than standard deviation. The calculation involves finding the median of the absolute deviations from the median of the dataset.

## Syntax

`MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(number)`

### Parameters

#### `number`

The input numeric values for which the median absolute deviation is calculated.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(salary)
```

Calculate the median and the median absolute deviation of employee salaries.

### Example 2: Using Inline Functions

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS m_a_d_max_salary_change = MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

Calculate the median absolute deviation of the maximum values in a multivalued column by first using `MV_MAX` to extract the maximum value per row.

## Limitations

- The `MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION` function is non-deterministic, meaning that repeated calculations on the same dataset may yield slightly different results.
- Like the `PERCENTILE` function, `MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION` typically provides approximate results.
