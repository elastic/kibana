# MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION

Returns the median absolute deviation, a robust measure of variability that is useful for describing data with outliers or non-normal distributions. It is calculated as the median of the absolute deviations from the median of the entire sample: `median(|median(X) - X|)`. This function is usually approximate and non-deterministic, so results may vary slightly for the same data.

## Syntax

`MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

The numeric column or expression for which to calculate the median absolute deviation.

## Examples

Calculates both the median and the median absolute deviation for the `salary` column in the `employees` dataset.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(salary)
```

Computes the median absolute deviation of the maximum value in the multivalued `salary_change` column, assigning the result to `m_a_d_max_salary_change`.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS m_a_d_max_salary_change = MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

## Limitations

- The result is usually approximate.
- The function is non-deterministic, so repeated runs on the same data may yield slightly different results.
