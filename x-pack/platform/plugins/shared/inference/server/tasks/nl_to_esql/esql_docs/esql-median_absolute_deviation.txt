# MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION

The MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION function calculates the median absolute deviation, a robust measure of variability. It is particularly useful for describing data with outliers or data that is not normally distributed, and can be more informative than standard deviation in such cases. The value is computed as the median of the absolute deviations from the median of the entire sample: `median(|median(X) - X|)`. The result is usually approximate and may vary slightly between runs.

## Syntax

`MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

The numeric column or expression for which to calculate the median absolute deviation.

## Examples

This query retrieves data from the `employees` index and calculates both the median and the median absolute deviation of the `salary` column, providing insights into the central tendency and variability of employee salaries.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(salary)
```

This query calculates the median absolute deviation of the maximum values found in the multivalued `salary_change` column for each document in the `employees` index. The result, labeled as `m_a_d_max_salary_change`, helps measure the variability of the largest salary changes among employees.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS m_a_d_max_salary_change = MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

## Limitations

- The result of MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION is usually approximate.
- The function is non-deterministic, so results may vary slightly even with the same data.
