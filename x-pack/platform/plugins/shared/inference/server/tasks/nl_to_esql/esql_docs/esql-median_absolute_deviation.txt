# MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION

The MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION function calculates the median absolute deviation, a robust measure of variability. It is particularly useful for describing data with outliers or non-normal distributions, and can be more informative than standard deviation in such cases. The value is computed as the median of the absolute differences between each data point and the median of the entire sample. For a variable `X`, this is expressed as `median(|median(X) - X|)`. The result is usually approximate.

## Syntax

`MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

The column or expression containing numeric values for which the median absolute deviation will be calculated.

## Examples

The following query calculates both the median and the median absolute deviation of the `salary` field for all employees. This helps you understand the central tendency and the variability of employee salaries, even in the presence of outliers.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(salary)
```

This query computes the median absolute deviation of the maximum salary change for each employee. It first finds the maximum salary change per employee (using `MV_MAX(salary_change)`), then calculates how much these maximum changes deviate from their median value.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS m_a_d_max_salary_change = MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

## Limitations

- The result of MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION is usually approximate.
- The function is non-deterministic, meaning you may get slightly different results using the same data.
