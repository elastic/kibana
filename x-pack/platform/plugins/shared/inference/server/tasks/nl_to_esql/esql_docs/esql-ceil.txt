# CEIL

Rounds a number up to the nearest integer. For `long` (including unsigned) and `integer` types, this function does nothing. For `double`, it returns the closest `double` value that is greater than or equal to the input, similar to `Math.ceil`.

## Syntax

`CEIL(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

Numeric expression to round up. If the value is `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

This query creates a row with the value `a` set to 1.8, then applies the `CEIL` function to round it up to the nearest integer, resulting in 2.

```esql
ROW a=1.8
| EVAL a=CEIL(a)
```
Rounds the value 1.8 up to 2.
