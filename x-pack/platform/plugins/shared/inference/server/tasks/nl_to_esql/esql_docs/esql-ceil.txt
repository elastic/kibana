# CEIL

Rounds a number up to the nearest integer. For `double` values, it returns the closest `double` value that is greater than or equal to the input, similar to `Math.ceil`. For `long` (including unsigned) and `integer` types, this function does not change the value.

## Syntax

`CEIL(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

Numeric expression to be rounded up. If the value is `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

Rounds the value 1.8 up to the next highest integer, resulting in 2.

```esql
ROW a=1.8
| EVAL a=CEIL(a)
```
