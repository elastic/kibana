# SCALB

The SCALB function returns the result of multiplying a number by 2 raised to the power of a scale factor, equivalent to `d * 2 ^ scaleFactor`. The result is rounded as if performed by a single correctly rounded floating-point multiply to a member of the double value set.

## Syntax

`SCALB(d, scaleFactor)`

### Parameters

#### d

Numeric expression for the multiplier. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### scaleFactor

Numeric expression for the scale factor. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

The following query creates a row with two columns, `x` set to 3.0 and `y` set to 10, then calculates a new column `z` as the result of multiplying `x` by 2 raised to the power of `y` (i.e., `3.0 * 2^10`).

```esql
row x = 3.0, y = 10 | eval z = scalb(x, y)
```
