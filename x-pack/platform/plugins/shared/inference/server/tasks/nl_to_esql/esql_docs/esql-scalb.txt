# SCALB

The SCALB function returns the result of multiplying a number by 2 raised to the power of a scale factor, equivalent to `d * 2 ^ scaleFactor`. The result is rounded as if performed by a single correctly rounded floating-point multiply to a member of the double value set.

## Syntax

`SCALB(d, scaleFactor)`

### Parameters

#### d

Numeric expression for the multiplier. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

#### scaleFactor

Numeric expression for the scale factor. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

This query creates a row with two columns, `x` set to 3.0 and `y` set to 10, then calculates the value of `x` multiplied by 2 to the power of `y` using the `scalb` function. The result is stored in a new column named `z`.

```esql
row x = 3.0, y = 10 | eval z = scalb(x, y)
```
