# KEEP

The KEEP command lets you specify which columns are returned and the order in which they appear. When a field name matches multiple expressions, precedence rules determine which expression is used. Fields are added in the order they are listed. The precedence rules are:
1. Complete field name (no wildcards)
2. Partial wildcard expressions (e.g., `fieldNam*`)
3. Wildcard only (`*`)

If a field matches two expressions with the same precedence, the rightmost expression takes priority.

## Syntax

`KEEP columns`

### Parameters

#### columns

A comma-separated list of columns to keep. Wildcards are supported. If a column matches multiple expressions, precedence rules determine which one is used.

## Examples

The columns are returned in the specified order:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP emp_no, first_name, last_name, height
```
Returns only the `emp_no`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `height` columns from the `employees` table, in that order.

Use wildcards to return all columns matching a pattern:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*
```
Returns all columns from the `employees` table whose names start with the letter `h`.

The asterisk wildcard (`*`) by itself includes all columns not matched by other arguments. This query returns columns starting with `h`, followed by all other columns:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*, *
```
Returns columns from the `employees` table that start with `h` first, then includes all remaining columns.

Complete field name has precedence over wildcard expressions:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, first_name*
```
Ensures that the `first_name` column is selected based on its exact name, taking precedence over the `first_name*` wildcard.

When wildcard expressions have the same priority, the rightmost one wins:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name*, last_name, first_na*
```
Uses the rightmost wildcard expression (`first_na*`) to match columns when multiple wildcards have the same precedence.

A simple wildcard expression `*` has the lowest precedence. Output order is determined by the other arguments:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP *, first_name
```
Returns all columns from the `employees` table, with `first_name` appearing last in the output.
