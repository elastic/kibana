# KEEP

The `KEEP` processing command enables you to specify what columns are returned
and the order in which they are returned.
Precedence rules are applied when a field name matches multiple expressions.
Fields are added in the order they appear. If one field matches multiple expressions, the following precedence rules apply (from highest to lowest priority):
1. Complete field name (no wildcards)
2. Partial wildcard expressions (for example: `fieldNam*`)
3. Wildcard only (`*`)

If a field matches two expressions with the same precedence, the rightmost expression wins.
Refer to the examples for illustrations of these precedence rules.

The `KEEP` processing command enables you to specify what columns are returned
and the order in which they are returned.
**Syntax**
```esql
KEEP columns
```

### Parameters

#### `columns`

A comma-separated list of columns to keep. Supports wildcards.
 See below for the behavior in case an existing column matches multiple
 given wildcards or column names.

**Examples**
The columns are returned in the specified order:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP emp_no, first_name, last_name, height
```

Rather than specify each column by name, you can use wildcards to return all
columns with a name that matches a pattern:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*
```

The asterisk wildcard (`*`) by itself translates to all columns that do not
match the other arguments.
This query will first return all columns with a name
that starts with `h`, followed by all other columns:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*, *
```

The following examples show how precedence rules work when a field name matches multiple expressions.
Complete field name has precedence over wildcard expressions:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, first_name*
```

Wildcard expressions have the same priority, but last one wins (despite being less specific):
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name*, last_name, first_na*
```

A simple wildcard expression `*` has the lowest precedence.
Output order is determined by the other arguments:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP *, first_name
```
