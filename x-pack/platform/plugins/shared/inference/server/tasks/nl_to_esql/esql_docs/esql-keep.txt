# KEEP

The KEEP command allows you to specify which columns are returned and the order in which they appear. When a field name matches multiple expressions, precedence rules determine which expression is used: complete field names have the highest priority, followed by partial wildcard expressions, and finally the wildcard-only expression. If two expressions have the same precedence, the rightmost one is chosen.

## Syntax

`KEEP columns`

### Parameters

#### columns

A comma-separated list of columns to keep. Wildcards are supported. If a column matches multiple expressions, precedence rules are applied to determine which expression is used.

## Examples

The columns are returned in the specified order:

This query retrieves data from the `employees` table and returns only the `emp_no`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `height` columns, in that specific order.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP emp_no, first_name, last_name, height
```

Select all columns with names that match a pattern using wildcards:

This query returns all columns from the `employees` table whose names start with the letter `h`.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*
```

Use the asterisk wildcard (`*`) to include all columns not matched by other arguments. This returns columns starting with `h` first, followed by all other columns:

This query first includes all columns from `employees` whose names start with `h`, and then adds all remaining columns, ensuring columns starting with `h` appear first in the result.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*, *
```

Demonstrate precedence rules: a complete field name takes precedence over wildcard expressions:

This query keeps the `first_name` and `last_name` columns from `employees`, and also matches any columns starting with `first_name`. However, the exact match for `first_name` takes precedence over the wildcard.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, first_name*
```

Show that when wildcard expressions have the same priority, the rightmost one wins:

This query keeps all columns from `employees` whose names start with `first_name` or `first_na`, as well as the `last_name` column. If a column matches both wildcard patterns, the rightmost pattern (`first_na*`) is used.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name*, last_name, first_na*
```

The simple wildcard expression `*` has the lowest precedence, and output order is determined by the other arguments:

This query returns all columns from `employees`, but ensures that the `first_name` column appears last in the result.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP *, first_name
```
