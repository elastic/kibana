# KEEP

The KEEP command allows you to specify which columns are returned and the order in which they appear. When a field name matches multiple expressions, precedence rules determine which expression is used. Fields are added in the order they are listed. The precedence rules, from highest to lowest, are:
1. Complete field name (no wildcards)
2. Partial wildcard expressions (e.g., `fieldNam*`)
3. Wildcard only (`*`)

If a field matches two expressions with the same precedence, the rightmost expression takes priority. See the examples for how these rules are applied.

## Syntax

`KEEP columns`

### Parameters

#### columns

A comma-separated list of columns to keep. Wildcards are supported. If a column matches multiple wildcards or names, precedence rules determine which one is used.

## Examples

The columns are returned in the specified order:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP emp_no, first_name, last_name, height
```
This example returns the columns `emp_no`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `height` in the specified order.

You can use wildcards to return all columns matching a pattern:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*
```
This example returns all columns whose names start with `h`.

The asterisk wildcard (`*`) by itself includes all columns not matched by other arguments. This query returns all columns starting with `h`, followed by all other columns:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*, *
```
This example first returns columns starting with `h`, then all remaining columns.

Complete field name has precedence over wildcard expressions:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, first_name*
```
This example returns `first_name` and `last_name`, with `first_name` taking precedence over the wildcard `first_name*`.

When wildcard expressions have the same priority, the rightmost one wins:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name*, last_name, first_na*
```
This example shows that if a column matches multiple wildcard expressions of the same precedence, the rightmost expression is used.

A simple wildcard expression `*` has the lowest precedence. Output order is determined by the other arguments:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP *, first_name
```
This example returns all columns, with `first_name` appearing last due to the order specified.
