## KEEP

The `KEEP` command specifies which columns are returned and the order in which they appear in the output.

## Syntax

`KEEP columns`

### Parameters

#### `columns`

A comma-separated list of columns to retain. Supports wildcards. If a column matches multiple expressions, precedence rules determine the final output.

## Examples

### Return columns in a specific order

The following query returns the `emp_no`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `height` columns in the specified order:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP emp_no, first_name, last_name, height
```

### Use wildcards to match column names

This query keeps all columns with names starting with `h`:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*
```

### Combine specific columns and wildcards

The asterisk wildcard (`*`) matches all columns not explicitly specified. This query returns all columns starting with `h` first, followed by all other columns:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*, *
```

### Precedence of complete field names over wildcards

When a column matches both a complete field name and a wildcard, the complete field name takes precedence:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, first_name*
```

### Wildcard precedence and ordering

If a column matches multiple wildcard expressions, the rightmost expression takes precedence, even if it is less specific:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name*, last_name, first_na*
```

### Lowest precedence for the `*` wildcard

The `*` wildcard has the lowest precedence. The order of other arguments determines the output order:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP *, first_name
```
