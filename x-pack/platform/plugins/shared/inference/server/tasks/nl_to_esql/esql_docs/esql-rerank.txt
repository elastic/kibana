# RERANK

The RERANK command uses an inference model to compute a new relevance score for an initial set of documents within your queries. Typically, you first retrieve a set of documents using a `WHERE` clause and a function like `MATCH`, sort by `_score`, and reduce the results with `LIMIT`. RERANK then processes this refined subset to balance performance and accuracy.

> **Note:**  
> RERANK processes each row through an inference model, which can impact performance and costs.
> - Starting in version 9.3.0, RERANK automatically limits processing to 1000 rows by default to prevent accidental high consumption. This limit is applied before RERANK executes. You can adjust this limit or disable the command using cluster settings.
> - In version 9.2.x, no automatic row limit is applied. You should always use LIMIT before or after RERANK to control the number of documents processed.

## Syntax

`RERANK [column =] query ON field [, field, ...] [WITH { "inference_id" : "my_inference_endpoint" }]`

### Parameters

#### column

(Optional) The name of the output column containing the reranked scores. If not specified, the results are stored in a column named `_score`. If the specified column already exists, it will be overwritten with the new results.

#### query

The query text used to rerank the documents. This is typically the same query used in the initial search.

#### field

One or more fields to use for reranking. These fields should contain the text that the reranking model will evaluate.

#### my_inference_endpoint

The ID of the inference endpoint to use for the task. The inference endpoint must be configured with the `rerank` task type.

## Examples

Rerank search results using a simple query and a single field:

This query retrieves book documents whose descriptions match the term "hobbit", sorts them by their initial relevance score, and limits the results to the top 100. It then uses the RERANK command with an inference model to compute new relevance scores based on the "hobbit" query and the description field. Finally, it returns the top 3 books with their titles and reranked scores.

```esql
FROM books METADATA _score
| WHERE MATCH(description, "hobbit")
| SORT _score DESC
| LIMIT 100
| RERANK "hobbit" ON description WITH { "inference_id" : "test_reranker" }
| LIMIT 3
| KEEP title, _score
```

Rerank search results using a query and multiple fields, and store the new score in a column named `rerank_score`:

This query retrieves books where either the description matches "hobbit" or the author matches "Tolkien", sorts them by their initial relevance score, and limits the results to the top 100. It then reranks these results using both the description and author fields, storing the new score in a column named `rerank_score`. The results are sorted by the reranked score, and the top 3 books are returned with their titles, original scores, and reranked scores.

```esql
FROM books METADATA _score
| WHERE MATCH(description, "hobbit") OR MATCH(author, "Tolkien")
| SORT _score DESC
| LIMIT 100
| RERANK rerank_score = "hobbit" ON description, author WITH { "inference_id" : "test_reranker" }
| SORT rerank_score
| LIMIT 3
| KEEP title, _score, rerank_score
```

Combine the original score with the reranked score:

This query retrieves books matching "hobbit" in the description or "Tolkien" as the author, sorts them by their initial score, and limits the results to 100. It reranks these results using both the description and author fields, storing the new score in `rerank_score`. It then creates a new column `original_score` to preserve the initial score, and updates `_score` to be the sum of the original and reranked scores. The results are sorted by this combined score, and the top 3 books are returned with all score columns.

```esql
FROM books METADATA _score
| WHERE MATCH(description, "hobbit") OR MATCH(author, "Tolkien")
| SORT _score DESC
| LIMIT 100
| RERANK rerank_score = "hobbit" ON description, author WITH { "inference_id" : "test_reranker" }
| EVAL original_score = _score, _score = rerank_score + original_score
| SORT _score
| LIMIT 3
| KEEP title, original_score, rerank_score, _score
```

## Limitations

- RERANK processes each row through an inference model, which can impact performance and costs.
- Starting in version 9.3.0, RERANK automatically limits processing to 1000 rows by default. You can adjust this limit or disable the command using cluster settings.
- In version 9.2.x, no automatic row limit is applied. Always use LIMIT before or after RERANK to control the number of documents processed.
- RERANK commands may time out when processing large datasets or complex queries. The default timeout is 10 minutes, but you can increase this limit depending on your deployment type.
- The inference endpoint must be configured with the `rerank` task type.
