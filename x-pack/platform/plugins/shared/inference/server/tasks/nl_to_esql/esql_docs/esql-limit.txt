# LIMIT

The LIMIT command restricts the number of rows returned by a query. It is useful for controlling the size of the result set, especially when you only need a subset of the data.

## Syntax

`LIMIT max_number_of_rows`

### Parameters

#### max_number_of_rows

The maximum number of rows to return.

## Examples

Limit the result to the first 5 employees sorted by employee number:

This query retrieves data from the `employees` index, sorts the employees in ascending order by their employee number, and then returns only the first 5 rows from the sorted results.

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no ASC
| LIMIT 5
```

## Limitations

Queries do not return more than 10,000 rows, regardless of the value specified in the LIMIT command. This is a configurable upper limit. The default and maximum limits can be changed using the following dynamic cluster settings:
- `esql.query.result_truncation_default_size`
- `esql.query.result_truncation_max_size`

The upper limit applies only to the number of rows output by the query, not to the number of documents processed. Increasing the limit may result in higher memory usage, longer processing times, and increased network traffic. These limitations are similar to those enforced by the search API for pagination.
