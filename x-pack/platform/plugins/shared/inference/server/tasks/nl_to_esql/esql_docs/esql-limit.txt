## LIMIT

The `LIMIT` command restricts the number of rows returned by a query.

## Syntax

`LIMIT max_number_of_rows`

### Parameters

#### `max_number_of_rows`

The maximum number of rows to return.

## Examples

### Example 1: Limiting the number of rows

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no ASC
| LIMIT 5
```

This query retrieves the first 5 rows from the `employees` index, sorted by the `emp_no` column in ascending order.

## Limitations

- Queries cannot return more than 10,000 rows, regardless of the value specified in the `LIMIT` command. This is a configurable upper limit.
- To address this limitation:
  - Modify the query to reduce the result set size by using filters, such as the `WHERE` command, to select a smaller subset of data.
  - Perform post-query processing within the query itself, for example, by using the `STATS` command to aggregate data.
- The 10,000-row limit applies only to the number of rows output by the query, not to the number of documents processed. The query operates on the full dataset.

### Additional Notes

- The default and maximum limits can be adjusted using the following dynamic cluster settings:
  - `esql.query.result_truncation_default_size`
  - `esql.query.result_truncation_max_size`
- Increasing these limits may lead to higher memory usage, longer processing times, and increased internode traffic within and across clusters.
