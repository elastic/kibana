## LIMIT

The `LIMIT` command restricts the number of rows returned by a query.

## Syntax

`LIMIT max_number_of_rows`

### Parameters

#### `max_number_of_rows`

The maximum number of rows to return.

## Description

The `LIMIT` command restricts the number of rows returned by a query. For example:

```esql
FROM index
| WHERE field == "value"
| LIMIT 1000
```

## Examples

Limit the result to the first 5 rows, sorted by `emp_no` in ascending order:

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no ASC
| LIMIT 5
```

## Limitations

- Queries cannot return more than 10,000 rows, even if the `LIMIT` value exceeds this threshold.

To work around this limitation:
  - Reduce the size of the result set by modifying the query to only return relevant data. This can be achieved by using the WHERE command to select a smaller subset of the data.
  - Shift any post-query processing to the query itself. The ES|QL STATS ... BY command can be used to aggregate data within the query.
