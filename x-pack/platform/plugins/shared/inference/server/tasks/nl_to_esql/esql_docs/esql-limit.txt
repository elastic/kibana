# LIMIT

The LIMIT command restricts the number of rows returned by a query. This is useful for controlling the size of the result set and for pagination.

## Syntax

`LIMIT max_number_of_rows`

### Parameters

#### max_number_of_rows

The maximum number of rows to return.

## Examples

Returns the first 5 employees from the employees index, sorted in ascending order by employee number.

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no ASC
| LIMIT 5
```

## Limitations

Queries do not return more than 10,000 rows, regardless of the LIMIT value. This is a configurable upper limit. The default and maximum limits can be changed using the dynamic cluster settings:
- `esql.query.result_truncation_default_size`
- `esql.query.result_truncation_max_size`

A larger result set increases memory usage, processing time, and network traffic. The upper limit applies only to the number of rows output by the query, not to the number of documents processed. These limitations are similar to those enforced by the search API for pagination.
