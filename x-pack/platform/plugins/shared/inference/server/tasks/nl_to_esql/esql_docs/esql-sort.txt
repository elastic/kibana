## SORT

The `SORT` command organizes a table by one or more columns.

## Syntax

`SORT column1 [ASC/DESC][NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST][, ..., columnN [ASC/DESC][NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST]]`

### Parameters

#### `columnX`

The column to sort on.

## Examples

### Basic sorting
Sort the table by the `height` column in ascending order (default behavior).

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height
```

### Explicitly sorting in descending order with `DESC`
Sort the table by the `height` column in descending order.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC
```

### Providing additional sort expressions to act as tie breakers
Sort the table by `height` in descending order, and use `first_name` in ascending order as a tie breaker.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC, first_name ASC
```

### Sorting `null` values first using `NULLS FIRST`
Sort the table by `first_name` in ascending order, placing `null` values first.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT first_name ASC NULLS FIRST
```
