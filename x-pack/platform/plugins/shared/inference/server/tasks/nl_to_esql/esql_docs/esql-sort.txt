# SORT

The SORT command arranges the rows of a table based on one or more columns. By default, sorting is in ascending order, but you can specify ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order explicitly. If multiple rows have the same value for the primary sort column, you can add additional columns as tie breakers. When sorting on columns with multiple values, the lowest value is used for ascending order and the highest for descending. By default, null values are considered larger than any other value, so they appear last in ascending order and first in descending order. You can override this behavior using NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST.

## Syntax

`SORT column1 [ASC/DESC][NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST][, ..., columnN [ASC/DESC][NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST]]`

### Parameters

#### columnX

The column to sort on.

## Examples

Sort employees by height in ascending order:

This query retrieves the first name, last name, and height of all employees, and then sorts the results so that employees with the smallest height appear first.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height
```

Sort employees by height in descending order:

This query fetches the first name, last name, and height of all employees, and sorts the results so that employees with the greatest height appear first.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC
```

Sort employees by height in descending order, using first name as a tie breaker in ascending order:

This query lists employees with their first name, last name, and height, sorting them by height from tallest to shortest. If two employees have the same height, it further sorts them by first name in alphabetical order.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC, first_name ASC
```

Sort employees by first name in ascending order, placing null values first:

This query displays employees' first name, last name, and height, sorting the results alphabetically by first name. Any employees with a missing (null) first name will appear at the top of the list.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT first_name ASC NULLS FIRST
```
