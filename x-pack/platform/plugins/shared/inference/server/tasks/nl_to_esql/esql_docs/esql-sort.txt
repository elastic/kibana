# SORT

The SORT command arranges the rows of a table based on one or more columns. By default, sorting is in ascending order, but you can specify ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order explicitly. If multiple rows have the same value for the primary sort column, you can provide additional columns as tie breakers. When sorting on multivalued columns, the lowest value is used for ascending order and the highest for descending. By default, null values are considered larger than any other value, so they appear last in ascending order and first in descending order. You can override this behavior with NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST.

## Syntax

`SORT column1 [ASC/DESC][NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST][, ..., columnN [ASC/DESC][NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST]]`

### Parameters

#### columnX

The column to sort on.

## Examples

Sort employees by height in ascending order:

This query selects the first name, last name, and height of each employee, then sorts the results so that employees are listed from shortest to tallest.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height
```

Sort employees by height in descending order:

This query selects the first name, last name, and height of each employee, then sorts the results so that employees are listed from tallest to shortest.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC
```

Sort employees by height in descending order, using first name as a tie breaker in ascending order:

This query selects the first name, last name, and height of each employee, sorts the results from tallest to shortest, and if two employees have the same height, it sorts those employees alphabetically by first name.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC, first_name ASC
```

Sort employees by first name in ascending order, placing null values first:

This query selects the first name, last name, and height of each employee, then sorts the results alphabetically by first name, with any rows where the first name is null appearing at the top of the list.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT first_name ASC NULLS FIRST
```
