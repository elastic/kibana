# SORT

The SORT command arranges the rows of a table based on one or more columns. By default, sorting is in ascending order, but you can specify `ASC` for ascending or `DESC` for descending order. If multiple rows have the same value for the primary sort column, you can add additional columns as tie breakers. When sorting on multivalued columns, the lowest value is used for ascending order and the highest for descending. By default, `null` values are considered larger than any other value, appearing last in ascending order and first in descending order. You can override this behavior with `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`.

## Syntax

`SORT column1 [ASC/DESC][NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST][, ..., columnN [ASC/DESC][NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST]]`

### Parameters

#### columnX

The column to sort on.

## Examples

Sorts the employees table by the `height` column in ascending order.
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height
```

Sorts the employees table by the `height` column in descending order.
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC
```

Sorts the employees table by `height` in descending order, and uses `first_name` in ascending order to break ties.
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC, first_name ASC
```

Sorts the employees table by `first_name` in ascending order, placing rows with `null` values in `first_name` at the top.
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT first_name ASC NULLS FIRST
```
