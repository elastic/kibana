Calculates the l2 norm similarity between the `rgb_vector` column and the vector `[0, 255, 255]`, then sorts the results by similarity in descending order and by color in ascending order.

```esql
from colors
| eval similarity = v_l2_norm(rgb_vector, [0, 255, 255])
| sort similarity desc, color asc
```
