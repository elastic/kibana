# V_L2_NORM

Calculates the l2 norm between two dense_vectors, which is a measure of similarity or distance between them.

## Syntax

`V_L2_NORM(left, right)`

### Parameters

#### left

The first dense_vector to calculate l2 norm similarity.

#### right

The second dense_vector to calculate l2 norm similarity.

## Examples

Calculates the l2 norm similarity between the `rgb_vector` column and the vector `[0, 255, 255]`, adds the result as a new column called `similarity`, and sorts the results by similarity in descending order and color in ascending order:

```esql
from colors
| eval similarity = v_l2_norm(rgb_vector, [0, 255, 255])
| sort similarity desc, color asc
```
