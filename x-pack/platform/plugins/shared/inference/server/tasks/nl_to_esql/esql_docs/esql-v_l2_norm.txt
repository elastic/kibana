# V_L2_NORM

The V_L2_NORM command calculates the l2 norm (Euclidean distance) between two dense vectors.

## Syntax

`V_L2_NORM(left, right)`

### Parameters

#### left

The first dense_vector used to calculate the l2 norm similarity.

#### right

The second dense_vector used to calculate the l2 norm similarity.

## Examples

The following query calculates the l2 norm (Euclidean distance) between the `rgb_vector` column and the vector `[0, 255, 255]` for each row in the `colors` table. It then creates a new column called `similarity` with the calculated values, and finally sorts the results by similarity in descending order and by color in ascending order.

```esql
from colors
| eval similarity = v_l2_norm(rgb_vector, [0, 255, 255])
| sort similarity desc, color asc
```
