# UNARY OPERATORS

The unary operator available is negation (`-`), which is used to invert the sign of a numeric value.

## Syntax

`-value`

### Parameters

#### value

The numeric value whose sign you want to invert.

## Examples

Negate a positive number:

Returns a row with column `a` set to 5 and column `b` set to -5 by applying negation.

```esql
ROW a = 5
| EVAL b = -a
```

Negate a negative number:

Returns a row with column `a` set to -10 and column `b` set to 10 by applying negation.

```esql
ROW a = -10
| EVAL b = -a
```

Negate a column value in a dataset:

Retrieves rows from the `numbers` index and adds a new column `negated` containing the negated value of the `number` field.

```esql
FROM numbers
| EVAL negated = -number
```
