# UNARY OPERATORS

The only unary operator is negation (`-`). Negation is used to invert the sign of a numeric value.

## Syntax

`-value`

### Parameters

#### value

The numeric value whose sign you want to invert.

## Examples

Negate a positive number:

This query creates a row with a column `a` set to 5, then uses the negation operator to create a new column `b` with the value -5.

```esql
ROW a = 5
| EVAL b = -a
```

Negate a negative number:

This query creates a row with a column `a` set to -3, then uses the negation operator to create a new column `b` with the value 3.

```esql
ROW a = -3
| EVAL b = -a
```

Negate a column value in a query:

This query retrieves data from the `numbers` table and creates a new column `negated` that contains the negated value of the `number` column for each row.

```esql
FROM numbers
| EVAL negated = -number
```
