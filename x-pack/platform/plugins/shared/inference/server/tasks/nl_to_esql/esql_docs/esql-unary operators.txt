# UNARY OPERATORS

The only unary operator is negation (`-`). It is used to invert the sign of a numeric value.

## Syntax

`-number`

### Parameters

#### number

The numeric value whose sign you want to invert.

## Examples

The following query creates a row with a salary value of 5000, then uses the negation operator to invert its sign, resulting in a new field `neg_salary` with the value -5000.

```esql
ROW salary = 5000
| EVAL neg_salary = -salary
```

This query creates a row with two fields, `a` and `b`, set to 10 and 3 respectively. It then calculates the difference (`a - b`), and applies the negation operator to invert the sign of the result, storing it in the field `result`.

```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 3
| EVAL result = -(a - b)
```
