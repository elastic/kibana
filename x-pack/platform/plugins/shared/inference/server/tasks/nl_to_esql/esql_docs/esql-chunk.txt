Splits a long sentence into multiple word-based chunks, each containing up to 10 words with a 1-word overlap between consecutive chunks, and then expands the results into individual rows.

```esql
ROW result = CHUNK("It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief.", {"strategy": "word", "max_chunk_size": 10, "overlap": 1})
| MV_EXPAND result
```
