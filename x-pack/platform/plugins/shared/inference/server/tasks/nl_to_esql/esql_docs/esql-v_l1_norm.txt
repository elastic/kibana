# V_L1_NORM

Calculates the l1 norm (Manhattan distance) between two dense_vectors.

## Syntax

`V_L1_NORM(left, right)`

### Parameters

#### left

First dense_vector to calculate l1 norm similarity.

#### right

Second dense_vector to calculate l1 norm similarity.

## Examples

Calculates the l1 norm similarity between each row's `rgb_vector` and the vector `[0, 255, 255]`, then sorts the results by similarity (highest first) and color (alphabetically).

```esql
from colors
| eval similarity = v_l1_norm(rgb_vector, [0, 255, 255])
| sort similarity desc, color asc
```
