# MIN_OVER_TIME

Calculates the minimum value of a field within a specified time window.

## Syntax

`MIN_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the minimum value for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the minimum.

## Examples

The following query calculates the minimum network cost over time, grouped by cluster and 1-minute time buckets. It first selects data from the `k8s` time series, then computes the sum of the minimum network cost within each 1-minute window for each cluster.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS cost=SUM(MIN_OVER_TIME(network.cost)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(1minute)
```
