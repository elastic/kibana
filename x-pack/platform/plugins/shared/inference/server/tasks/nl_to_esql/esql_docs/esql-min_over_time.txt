# MIN_OVER_TIME

Calculates the minimum value of a field over a specified time window.

## Syntax

`MIN_OVER_TIME(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the minimum value for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the minimum.

## Examples

Calculate the minimum network cost over time, grouped by cluster and 1-minute time buckets:

This query retrieves data from the `k8s` time series, calculates the minimum value of `network.cost` within each time window, sums these minimum values, and then groups the results by `cluster` and by 1-minute time buckets.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS cost=SUM(MIN_OVER_TIME(network.cost)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(1minute)
```
