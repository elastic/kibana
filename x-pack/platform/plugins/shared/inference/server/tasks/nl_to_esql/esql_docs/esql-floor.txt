# FLOOR

Rounds a number down to the nearest integer. For `double` values, it selects the closest `double` representation of the integer, similar to `Math.floor`. For `long` (including unsigned) and `integer`, this operation has no effect.

## Syntax

`FLOOR(number)`

### Parameters

#### `number`

Numeric expression. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

```esql
ROW a=1.8
| EVAL a = FLOOR(a)
```

Rounds the value `1.8` down to `1`.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height_floor = FLOOR(height)
```
Rounds all values in the column `height` down to nearest integer

## Notes

- The FLOOR function is a no-operation for `long` (including unsigned) and `integer` types. For `double` type, this function picks the closest `double` value to the integer, similar to the Math.floor method in programming languages.
