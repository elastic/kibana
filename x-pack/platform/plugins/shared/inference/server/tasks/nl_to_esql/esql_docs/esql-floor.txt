# FLOOR

Rounds a number down to the nearest integer. For `long` (including unsigned) and `integer` types, this operation does nothing. For `double` types, it selects the closest `double` value that is less than or equal to the input, similar to the behavior of Math.floor.

## Syntax

`FLOOR(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

Numeric expression to be rounded down. If the value is `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

This query creates a row with a column `a` set to 1.8, then uses the `FLOOR` function to round the value down to the nearest integer, resulting in `a` being 1.

```esql
ROW a=1.8
| EVAL a=FLOOR(a)
```
