# FLOOR

Rounds a number down to the nearest integer. For `double` values, it selects the closest `double` value to the integer, similar to Math.floor. For `long` (including unsigned) and `integer`, this operation has no effect.

## Syntax

`FLOOR(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

Numeric expression to be rounded down. If the value is `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

Rounds the value 1.8 down to the nearest integer using the FLOOR function:

```esql
ROW a=1.8
| EVAL a=FLOOR(a)
```
