# FLOOR

Rounds a number down to the nearest integer. For `long` (including unsigned) and `integer` types, this operation has no effect. For `double`, it returns the closest `double` value less than or equal to the input, similar to `Math.floor`.

## Syntax

`FLOOR(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

Numeric expression to round down. If the value is `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

Rounds the value 1.8 down to 1.
```esql
ROW a=1.8
| EVAL a=FLOOR(a)
```
