# MEDIAN

The MEDIAN function returns the value that is greater than half of all values and less than half of all values, also known as the 50th percentile. The result is usually approximate and may vary slightly for the same data due to its non-deterministic nature.

## Syntax

`MEDIAN(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

Expression that outputs the values to calculate the median of.

## Examples

The following query calculates both the median and the 50th percentile of the `salary` column from the `employees` data source. This helps you understand the central tendency of employee salaries.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
```

This query calculates the median of the maximum values found in a multivalued column called `salary_change`. It first determines the maximum salary change for each record using `MV_MAX`, and then computes the median of those maximum values.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS median_max_salary_change = MEDIAN(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

## Limitations

- The MEDIAN function is usually approximate.
- MEDIAN is non-deterministic, so results may vary slightly even with the same data.
