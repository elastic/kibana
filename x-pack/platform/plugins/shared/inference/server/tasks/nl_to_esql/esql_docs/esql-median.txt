# MEDIAN

The `MEDIAN` function calculates the value that is greater than half of all values and less than half of all values, also known as the 50th percentile (`PERCENTILE`). The result is usually approximate and non-deterministic, meaning repeated calculations on the same data may yield slightly different results.

## Syntax

`MEDIAN(number)`

### Parameters

#### `number`

The input numeric value for which the median is calculated.

## Examples

### Example 1: Calculating the median and 50th percentile of salaries

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
```

### Example 2: Calculating the median of maximum values in a multivalued column

To calculate the median of the maximum values of a multivalued column, use the `MV_MAX` function to get the maximum value per row, and then apply the `MEDIAN` function:

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS median_max_salary_change = MEDIAN(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

## Limitations

- The `MEDIAN` function is non-deterministic, meaning repeated calculations on the same dataset may produce slightly different results.
- The result is usually approximate, similar to the `PERCENTILE` function.
