# MEDIAN

The MEDIAN function returns the value that is greater than half of all values and less than half of all values, also known as the 50th percentile. The result is usually approximate and may be non-deterministic, meaning you can get slightly different results using the same data.

## Syntax

`MEDIAN(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

Expression that outputs the values to calculate the median of.

## Examples

Calculates both the median salary and the 50th percentile salary for all employees.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
```

Finds the median of the maximum salary change for each employee.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS median_max_salary_change = MEDIAN(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

## Limitations

- The MEDIAN function is usually approximate.
- MEDIAN is non-deterministic and may return slightly different results for the same data.
