# MEDIAN

The value that is greater than half of all values and less than half of all values, also known as the 50% `PERCENTILE`.
<note>
  Like `PERCENTILE`, `MEDIAN` is usually approximate.
</note>

**Syntax**
`MEDIAN(number)`

### Parameters

#### `number`

Expression that outputs values to calculate the median of.

**Supported types**

**Examples**
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
```

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the median of the maximum values of a multivalued column, first use `MV_MAX` to get the maximum value per row, and use the result with the `MEDIAN` function
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS median_max_salary_change = MEDIAN(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

<warning>
  `MEDIAN` is also non-deterministic.
  This means you can get slightly different results using the same data.
