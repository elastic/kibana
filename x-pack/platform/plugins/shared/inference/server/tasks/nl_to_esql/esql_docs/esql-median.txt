# MEDIAN

The MEDIAN function returns the value that is greater than half of all values and less than half of all values, also known as the 50th percentile. The result is usually approximate and can be non-deterministic, meaning you may get slightly different results using the same data.

## Syntax

`MEDIAN(number)`

### Parameters

#### number

Expression that outputs values to calculate the median of.

## Examples

The following query calculates both the median salary and the 50th percentile salary for all employees, allowing you to compare the results of the MEDIAN and PERCENTILE functions:

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
```

This query calculates the median of the maximum salary change for each employee. It first finds the maximum salary change per employee (if there are multiple values), and then computes the median of those maximum values:

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS median_max_salary_change = MEDIAN(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

## Limitations

- The MEDIAN function is usually approximate.
- The MEDIAN function is non-deterministic and may return slightly different results for the same data.
