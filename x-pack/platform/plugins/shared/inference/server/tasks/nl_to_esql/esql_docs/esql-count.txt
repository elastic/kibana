# COUNT

The COUNT function returns the total number of input values. If no field is specified, it returns the number of rows.

## Syntax

`COUNT(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

Expression that outputs values to be counted. If omitted, COUNT returns the number of rows.

## Examples

Counts the number of non-null values in the `height` field from the `employees` dataset.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS COUNT(height)
```

Counts the total number of rows for each language in the `employees` dataset and sorts the results by language in descending order.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS count = COUNT(*) BY languages
| SORT languages DESC
```

Counts how many words are present in the `words` string by splitting it using the semicolon as a delimiter.

```esql
ROW words="foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;foo"
| STATS word_count = COUNT(SPLIT(words, ";"))
```

Counts the number of times the value of `n` is less than 0 by filtering rows before counting.

```esql
ROW n=1
| WHERE n < 0
| STATS COUNT(n)
```

Counts how many times `n` is greater than 0 and how many times `n` is less than 0 in the same data stream.

```esql
ROW n=1
| STATS COUNT(n > 0 OR NULL), COUNT(n < 0 OR NULL)
```
