# COUNT

The COUNT function returns the total number of input values. If no field is specified, it counts the number of rows.

## Syntax

`COUNT(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

Expression that outputs values to be counted. If omitted, COUNT returns the number of rows.

## Examples

This query counts the number of non-null values in the `height` field from the `employees` data source.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS COUNT(height)
```

This query counts the number of rows for each language in the `employees` data source, assigns the result to the `count` field, and sorts the output by language in descending order.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS count = COUNT(*) BY languages
| SORT languages DESC
```

This query splits the string in the `words` field using the semicolon (`;`) as a delimiter, then counts the number of resulting values and assigns it to the `word_count` field.

```esql
ROW words="foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;foo"
| STATS word_count = COUNT(SPLIT(words, ";"))
```

This query creates a single row with the value `n=1`, filters for rows where `n` is less than 0 (which will result in no rows), and then counts the number of rows that meet this condition.

```esql
ROW n=1
| WHERE n < 0
| STATS COUNT(n)
```

This query creates a single row with `n=1` and then counts, using three-valued logic, how many times the expression `n > 0 OR NULL` and `n < 0 OR NULL` are true, respectively.

```esql
ROW n=1
| STATS COUNT(n > 0 OR NULL), COUNT(n < 0 OR NULL)
```
