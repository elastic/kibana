# COUNT

Returns the total number (count) of input values.

**Syntax**
`COUNT(field)`

### Parameters

#### `field`

Expression that outputs values to be counted. If omitted, equivalent to `COUNT(*)` (the number of rows).

**Supported types**

**Examples**
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS COUNT(height)
```

To count the number of rows, use `COUNT()` or `COUNT(*)`
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS count = COUNT(*) BY languages
| SORT languages DESC
```

The expression can use inline functions. This example splits a string into multiple values using the `SPLIT` function and counts the values
```esql
ROW words="foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;foo"
| STATS word_count = COUNT(SPLIT(words, ";"))
```

To count the number of times an expression returns `TRUE` use a `WHERE` command to remove rows that shouldn’t be included
```esql
ROW n=1
| WHERE n < 0
| STATS COUNT(n)
```

To count the same stream of data based on two different expressions use the pattern `COUNT(<expression> OR NULL)`. This builds on the three-valued logic (3VL) of the language: `TRUE OR NULL` is `TRUE`, but `FALSE OR NULL` is `NULL`, plus the way COUNT handles `NULL`s: `COUNT(TRUE)` and `COUNT(FALSE)` are both 1, but `COUNT(NULL)` is 0.
```esql
ROW n=1
| STATS COUNT(n > 0 OR NULL), COUNT(n < 0 OR NULL)
```
