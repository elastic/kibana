# COUNT

The COUNT function returns the total number of input values. If no field is specified, it counts the number of rows.

## Syntax

`COUNT(field)`

### Parameters

#### field

Expression that outputs values to be counted. If omitted, COUNT counts the number of rows, equivalent to `COUNT(*)`.

## Examples

Count the number of non-null values in the `height` field:

This query retrieves all records from the `employees` index and counts how many of them have a non-null value in the `height` field.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS COUNT(height)
```

Count the number of rows per language using `COUNT(*)`:

This query retrieves all records from the `employees` index, groups them by the `languages` field, and counts the total number of rows for each language. The results are then sorted in descending order by language.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS count = COUNT(*) BY languages
| SORT languages DESC
```

Count the number of values produced by splitting a string using the `SPLIT` function:

This query creates a single row with a field called `words` containing a semicolon-separated string. It splits the string into individual words using the `SPLIT` function and counts the number of resulting values.

```esql
ROW words="foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;foo"
| STATS word_count = COUNT(SPLIT(words, ";"))
```

Count the number of times an expression returns `TRUE` by filtering with `WHERE`:

This query creates a single row with the value `n=1`, filters the data to only include rows where `n < 0` (which will be none), and then counts the number of remaining rows (which will be zero).

```esql
ROW n=1
| WHERE n < 0
| STATS COUNT(n)
```

Count the same stream of data based on two different expressions using `COUNT(<expression> OR NULL)`:

This query creates a single row with `n=1` and then counts how many times `n > 0` is true and how many times `n < 0` is true, using the `COUNT(<expression> OR NULL)` pattern. The result will show counts for both expressions.

```esql
ROW n=1
| STATS COUNT(n > 0 OR NULL), COUNT(n < 0 OR NULL)
```

## Limitations

No specific limitations are mentioned for the COUNT function.
