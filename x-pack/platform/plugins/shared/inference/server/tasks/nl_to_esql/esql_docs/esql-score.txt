# SCORE

The SCORE function evaluates an expression and returns the relevance scores for all resulting documents. Only expressions using full text functions are scored.

## Syntax

`SCORE(query)`

### Parameters

#### query

## Examples

Calculates the relevance score for each document where the title matches "Return" and the author matches "Tolkien", and assigns the score for the title match to the `first_score` field.

```esql
FROM books METADATA _score
| WHERE match(title, "Return") AND match(author, "Tolkien")
| EVAL first_score = score(match(title, "Return"))
```
