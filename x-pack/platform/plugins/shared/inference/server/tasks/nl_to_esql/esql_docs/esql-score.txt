# SCORE

The SCORE function evaluates an expression and returns relevance scores for all resulting documents. Only full text functions are scored.

## Syntax

`SCORE(query)`

### Parameters

#### query

Boolean expression containing one or more full text functions to be scored.

## Examples

This query retrieves documents from the `books` index, including the metadata field `_score`. It filters for books where the title matches "Return" and the author matches "Tolkien". Then, it calculates the relevance score for the title match and stores it in a new field called `first_score`.

```esql
FROM books METADATA _score
| WHERE match(title, "Return") AND match(author, "Tolkien")
| EVAL first_score = score(match(title, "Return"))
```
