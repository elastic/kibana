# SCORE

The SCORE function calculates the relevance score of an expression. Only full text functions are scored, and it returns scores for all resulting documents.

## Syntax

`SCORE(query)`

### Parameters

#### query

A boolean expression containing full text function(s) to be scored.

## Examples

This query retrieves documents from the `books` index where the `title` matches "Return" and the `author` matches "Tolkien". It then calculates the relevance score for the title match and stores it in a new field called `first_score`.

```esql
FROM books METADATA _score
| WHERE match(title, "Return") AND match(author, "Tolkien")
| EVAL first_score = score(match(title, "Return"))
```
