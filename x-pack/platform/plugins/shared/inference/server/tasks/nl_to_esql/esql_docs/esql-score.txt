# SCORE

The SCORE function calculates the relevance score of an expression. Only full text functions are scored, and it returns scores for all resulting documents.

## Syntax

`SCORE(query)`

### Parameters

#### query

A boolean expression containing full text function(s) to be scored.

## Examples

Calculates the relevance score for documents where the title matches "Return" and the author matches "Tolkien", and assigns the score for the title match to a new field.

```esql
FROM books METADATA _score
| WHERE match(title, "Return") AND match(author, "Tolkien")
| EVAL first_score = score(match(title, "Return"))
```
