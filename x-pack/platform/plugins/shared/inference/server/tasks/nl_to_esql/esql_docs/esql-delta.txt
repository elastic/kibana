# DELTA

Calculates the absolute change of a gauge field within a specified time window.

## Syntax

`DELTA(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field for which to calculate the absolute change.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the delta.

## Examples

The following query calculates the sum of the absolute change in network bytes received for the pod named "one", grouping the results by cluster and by 10-minute time intervals:

```esql
TS k8s
| WHERE pod == "one"
| STATS tx = SUM(DELTA(network.bytes_in)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(10minute)
```
