# DELTA

Calculates the absolute change of a gauge field within a specified time window.

## Syntax

`DELTA(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field for which to calculate the change.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the delta.

## Examples

The following query calculates the sum of the change in `network.bytes_in` for each cluster and 10-minute time bucket, but only for pods named "one". This helps you understand how much incoming network traffic has changed over time for each cluster, grouped into 10-minute intervals.

```esql
TS k8s
| WHERE pod == "one"
| STATS tx = SUM(DELTA(network.bytes_in)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(10minute)
```
