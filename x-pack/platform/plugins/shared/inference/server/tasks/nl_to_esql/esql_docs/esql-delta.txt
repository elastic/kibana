# DELTA

Calculates the absolute change of a gauge field within a specified time window.

## Syntax

`DELTA(field, window)`

### Parameters

#### field

The metric field to calculate the value for.

#### window

The time window over which to compute the delta.

## Examples

Calculates the total change in incoming network bytes for pods named "one", grouped by cluster and 10-minute intervals.

```esql
TS k8s
| WHERE pod == "one"
| STATS tx = SUM(DELTA(network.bytes_in)) BY cluster, time_bucket = TBUCKET(10minute)
```
