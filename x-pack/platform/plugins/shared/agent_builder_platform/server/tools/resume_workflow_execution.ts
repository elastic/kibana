      cleanPrompt(`Resume a workflow execution that is paused and waiting for human input.

    Use this tool when a workflow execution returned with status "waiting_for_input".
    The execution's "waiting_input" field describes what input is expected (message and optional schema).
    Provide the executionId and the required input object to resume the workflow.

    **Important - read after resume:** a successful call means resume was **accepted and scheduled** in the engine.
    The execution record can **lag**: you may still briefly see the same "waiting_for_input" and the same form right after this tool returns. **Do not** tell the user there is another HITL step, a loop or a second approval round unless you have **confirmed** a genuinely new pause (clear evidence such as a new step, changed context, or repeated status checks that rule out a stale snapshot).

    **What you should do:** call ${platformCoreTools.getWorkflowExecutionStatus} on the same executionId. Compare **waiting_input.step_execution_id** between polls: if it **changes** while still waiting_for_input, that is evidence of a **new** HITL step; if it is the **same** id immediately after resume, treat it as likely stale until status moves on. Stop once the status clearly updates (e.g. completed, failed, running) or after **up to ~5 status polls** without any change.

    **If status has not changed after those polls:** tell the user their resume was **submitted**, but you **could not confirm** the new execution state from Kibana yet - do **not** invent a second approval workflow.
