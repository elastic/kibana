  content: `## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when a user asks about Agent Builder's own OTel (OpenTelemetry) traces or
runtime activity, for example:
- Token usage (input, output, total) overall or broken down by model/provider.
- LLM request counts and which models or providers are most used.
- Conversation, agent-execution, or tool-call latency (average, p95, max).
- Tool-call volume, the most-used tools, and tool error/success rates.
- Trends of any of the above over time.

## Questions This Skill Can Answer

- "How many tokens has Agent Builder used in the last 24 hours / 7 days?"
- "What's the input vs. output token breakdown by model?"
- "Which model (or provider) is used the most?"
- "How many LLM requests / conversations / agent executions happened today?"
- "What's the average and p95 conversation (or agent execution) latency?"
- "What's the slowest agent execution recently?"
- "How many tool calls were made, and which tools are used the most?"
- "What's the tool error rate / success rate?"
- "Show me token usage (or tool calls) over time."
- "Are there any errors in the Agent Builder OTel traces?"

Do **not** use this skill when:
- The user wants to query their *own* data indices (use the general data-exploration tools).
- The user wants to build or modify a dashboard (use the dashboard-management skill).

## Data Source

Agent Builder ships its traces as OpenTelemetry spans to a per-space ES|QL source:

\`\`\`
traces-agent_builder.otel-<space-id>
\`\`\`

Always use the \`${AGENT_BUILDER_TRACES_ESQL_INLINE_TOOL_ID}\` inline tool for trace questions.
It resolves the current space's index automatically. Do not use a
\`traces-agent_builder.otel-*\` wildcard, which would mix in other spaces' traces.

If you need to run ES|QL manually, use the exact index returned by the inline tool.

Always constrain the time range with \`@timestamp\` to the window the user asked about (default to
the last 24 hours when they do not specify one).

### Span names (\`span.name\` field)

Span names follow the OTel \`{operation} {identifier}\` convention:

- \`chat <model>\` — one span per LLM call (token usage lives here). Match with \`span.name LIKE "chat *"\`.
- \`execute_tool <toolId>\` — one span per tool call. Match with \`span.name LIKE "execute_tool *"\`.
- \`invoke_agent <name>\` — agent or conversation spans. Distinguish with \`attributes.elastic.inference.span.kind\`:
  - \`"CHAIN"\` — one span per conversation turn.
  - \`"AGENT"\` — one span per agent execution.

### Useful fields

- \`attributes.gen_ai.usage.input_tokens\` / \`attributes.gen_ai.usage.output_tokens\` — wrap in \`TO_LONG(...)\` before aggregating.
- \`attributes.gen_ai.request.model\` — model name.
- \`attributes.gen_ai.provider.name\` — provider name.
- \`attributes.gen_ai.agent.id\` — agent id (hashed for custom agents in exported traces).
- \`duration\` — span duration in **nanoseconds**; divide by \`1000000000.0\` for seconds.
- \`status.code\` — equals \`"Error"\` for failed spans.

## How to Answer

1. Call \`${AGENT_BUILDER_TRACES_ESQL_INLINE_TOOL_ID}\` with the user's question.
2. Use ${platformCoreTools.executeEsql} only when you already have a validated ES|QL query from the inline tool.
3. Prefer compact \`STATS\` aggregations over returning raw spans, and report the numbers in plain language.

### Example query patterns

These patterns assume the current space traces index. Replace \`<traces-index>\` with the index
returned by the inline tool.

Total tokens by model (last 24h):

\`\`\`esql
FROM <traces-index>
| WHERE @timestamp >= NOW() - 24 hours
| WHERE span.name LIKE "chat *"
| STATS \`Total Tokens\` = SUM(TO_LONG(attributes.gen_ai.usage.input_tokens))
      + SUM(TO_LONG(attributes.gen_ai.usage.output_tokens))
    BY \`Model\` = attributes.gen_ai.request.model
| SORT \`Total Tokens\` DESC
\`\`\`

LLM requests by provider:

\`\`\`esql
FROM <traces-index>
| WHERE @timestamp >= NOW() - 24 hours
| WHERE span.name LIKE "chat *"
| STATS \`Requests\` = COUNT(*) BY \`Provider\` = attributes.gen_ai.provider.name
| SORT \`Requests\` DESC
\`\`\`

Conversation latency (avg and p95, seconds):

\`\`\`esql
FROM <traces-index>
| WHERE @timestamp >= NOW() - 24 hours
| WHERE span.name LIKE "invoke_agent *" AND attributes.elastic.inference.span.kind == "CHAIN"
| EVAL duration_sec = duration / 1000000000.0
| STATS \`Avg (s)\` = ROUND(AVG(duration_sec), 2), \`P95 (s)\` = ROUND(PERCENTILE(duration_sec, 95), 2)
\`\`\`

Tool success rate:

\`\`\`esql
FROM <traces-index>
| WHERE @timestamp >= NOW() - 24 hours
| WHERE span.name LIKE "execute_tool *"
| STATS total = COUNT(*), errors = COUNT(*) WHERE status.code == "Error"
| EVAL \`Success Rate (%)\` = ROUND((total - errors) * 100.0 / total, 2)
| KEEP \`Success Rate (%)\`
\`\`\`

Most-used tools:

\`\`\`esql
FROM <traces-index>
| WHERE @timestamp >= NOW() - 24 hours
| WHERE span.name LIKE "execute_tool *"
| STATS \`Tool Calls\` = COUNT(*) BY \`Tool\` = span.name
| SORT \`Tool Calls\` DESC
| LIMIT 15
\`\`\`

## Edge Cases

- If a query returns no rows, explain that the time window may be empty or that
  the \`${AGENT_BUILDER_TRACING_ENABLED_SETTING_ID}\` UI setting is not enabled. Do not fabricate values.
- Token fields can be missing on non-LLM spans; always filter to \`span.name LIKE "chat *"\`
  before aggregating token usage.
- \`duration\` is in nanoseconds — never report it raw; convert to seconds (or ms) for the user.
