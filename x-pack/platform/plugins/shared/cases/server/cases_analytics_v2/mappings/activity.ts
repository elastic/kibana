/**
 * Mapping for the `.cases-activity` analytics index. One document per
 * `cases-user-actions` SO, keyed on the user-action SO id.
 *
 * Mirrors the user-actions SO mapping at
 * `server/saved_object_types/user_actions.ts` except where an
 * analytics-only divergence is noted inline. `dynamic: 'strict'` makes
 * a doc-builder field not declared here fail the write with
 * `mapper_parsing_exception`, surfacing in logs instead of silently
 * dropping. The three-layer drift guard in
 * `mappings/activity_schema_drift.test.ts` catches accidental drift
 * (see the README for the layered contract).
 *
 * Field group conventions:
 *   - `@timestamp` — required by Discover / Lens; set to the user
 *     action's `created_at` (immutable, no later edits).
 *   - `space_id` / `owner` — top-level (document-root) scoping fields for
 *     implicit-privileges DLS, matching the cases surface (see
 *     `mappings/case.ts`). `space_id` is singular — a user action belongs
 *     to exactly one case in one space.
 *   - `case.id` — denormalized from the SO `references[case]` so
 *     ES|QL `LOOKUP JOIN .cases ON case.id` works without an
 *     intermediate aggregation.
 *   - `actor.*` — flattened `created_by` so `actor.username` etc. are
 *     first-class analytics dimensions.
 *   - `action.*` — the user-action shape: `type`, `verb`, the
 *     polymorphic `payload` stringified as `action.payload_json`, plus
 *     a curated set of typed extracts for the common analytical pivots.
 *
 * Intentional divergences from the SO mapping:
 *   - `payload`: SO uses `dynamic: false` with a sparse set of indexed
 *     sub-fields. The analytics index strict-maps the curated extracts
 *     and also stringifies the full payload as `action.payload_json`
 *     (`wildcard`, no length cap). The string carries every payload
 *     sub-field so analysts can reach into it via ES|QL
 *     (`MV_AVG(MV_FROM_JSON(payload_json, "status"))` and similar);
 *     the curated extracts give first-class faceting in Lens without
 *     requiring users to know the JSON structure.
 *   - `payload.connector.fields`: dropped. Polymorphic per connector
 *     type and not an analytics dimension; the connector instance id
 *     (`connector_id_new`) is what tracks adoption.
 *
 * Curated extracts are bounded keyword fields chosen for value to
 * common analyses (status flow, severity changes, assignees changes,
 * tag churn, connector adoption). They're populated only when the
 * relevant action `type` carries a matching payload sub-field; other
 * action types leave them unset (no defaults, consistent with
 * `dynamic: 'strict'`). See `writer/activity_doc_builder.ts` for the
 * per-type extraction.
