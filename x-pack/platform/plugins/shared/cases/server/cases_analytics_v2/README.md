# Cases Analytics v2

Cluster-level analytics indices for the cases plugin, populated by real-time
saved-object hooks with periodic reconciliation as the durability backstop.
Replaces the per-(space × owner) reindex pipeline at `server/cases_analytics/`.

## Status

v2 is gated by `xpack.cases.analyticsV2.enabled` (default `false`). v1
(`server/cases_analytics/`) remains the primary path while v2 is being
validated.

v2 ships three surfaces: the **`case` surface** (`.cases`), the
**`activity` surface** (`.cases-activity`), and the
**`attachments` surface** (`.cases-attachments`).

```

**Two write paths** — fire-and-forget hooks on every case create / patch /
delete (primary, low-latency), and a periodic reconciliation task (backstop,
catches anything the primary path missed). Both call `writer.upsertCase` /
`writer.deleteCase`, which are idempotent against the same `_id`.

## Index layout

| Surface       | Index                | Mode                         | Source SO(s)                            |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `case`        | `.cases`             | `index.mode: lookup`, hidden | `cases`                                 |
| `activity`    | `.cases-activity`    | plain, hidden                | `cases-user-actions`                    |
| `attachments` | `.cases-attachments` | plain, hidden                | `cases-comments` AND `cases-attachments` |

`.cases` is **lookup-mode** so the fact-table surfaces (activity, attachments)
can `LOOKUP JOIN` it from ES|QL — "for each activity / attachment row,
what's the current case title / severity / owner?" without denormalization
at write time. Lookup mode is Technical Preview as of Elasticsearch 8.18 /
9.0; the breaking-change risk is acceptable for cases data because the
dataset fits comfortably (single shard handles ~50GB; a tenant with millions
of cases at ~2KB/doc is a few GB at most).

`.cases-activity` and `.cases-attachments` are plain regular indices — they
grow per-event and shouldn't be locked to a single shard.

### Attachments dual-source

The attachments surface is **populated from two source SO types** —
`cases-comments` (legacy) and `cases-attachments` (new unified shape).
Both types coexist: the unified `cases-attachments` SO is **always
registered** (since [#275225](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/275225)),
and legacy `cases-comments` SOs are never back-migrated, so any tenant
can hold attachments of either type at once. Both sources flow through
the same writer; the doc-builder calls
`getAttachmentTypeTransformers(...).toUnifiedSchema(...)` on the SO
attributes so the analytics index always reflects the **unified** shape
regardless of which source SO the AttachmentService wrote to (legacy →
unified projection, or an identity transform for already-unified
attributes).

Because both SO types are always registered, there is no source-type
gating: the reconciliation + reset runners unconditionally walk **both**
`cases-comments` and `cases-attachments`, and both are opted into the
v2 internal SO repository (`plugin.ts`) unconditionally. (Historically
this was gated on `xpack.cases.attachments.enabled` to avoid walking /
opting-in an unregistered SO type — `openPointInTimeForType` and
`createInternalRepository` both throw at start for an unregistered
type — but that flag no longer controls registration.)

Doc `_id` is the source SO id verbatim. SO ids are unique across both
source types (the `AttachmentService.bulkDelete` path issues parallel
deletes against both types with the same id, confirming the
constraint), so an attachment that gets migrated post-write doesn't
double-emit — the second write overwrites the first by `_id`.

## Configuration

```yaml
xpack.cases.analyticsV2:
  enabled: false # default — set to true to opt in
  reconciliationIntervalMinutes:
    30 # default — Task Manager cadence for the
    # reconciliation backstop. Min 5; lower
    # values catch up faster after a hook
    # failure but cost more SO walks against
    # the cases index. Picked up at plugin
    # start: on every Kibana boot, the
    # reconciliation task's persisted schedule
    # is reconciled against this value via
    # `bulkUpdateSchedules`. Changing the value
    # therefore requires a Kibana restart to
    # take effect — runtime changes are not
    # picked up automatically.
  enableAdminRoutes:
    false # default — set to true to register the
    # mutating administrator routes (/reset and
    # /reconcile/run_soon). The read-only /state
    # route is unaffected (always registered
    # while analyticsV2.enabled is true). See
    # "Debug-mode routes" below for the rationale.
  resetTaskTimeoutMinutes:
    60 # default — wall-clock budget for the
    # one-shot backfill task scheduled by /reset.
    # Comfortable through ~2K spaces; raise for
    # larger tenants (see "Tuning /reset at
    # scale" below). Min 5, max 1440 (24h).
  resetPageDelayMs:
    0 # default — inter-page sleep applied by the
    # reconciliation runners ONLY when invoked
    # from the reset task. Default 0 keeps the
    # post-reset backfill as fast as possible.
    # Administrators on shared / capacity-constrained
    # ES clusters raise this to throttle bulk-
    # write pressure during the backfill. Min 0,
    # max 5000.
```

When `analyticsV2.enabled: false`, the v2 service is a no-op. Nothing
registers, nothing schedules, nothing writes. v1 is unaffected regardless of
v2's state. When `analyticsV2.enableAdminRoutes: false` (the default) but
`analyticsV2.enabled: true`, v2 runs normally and `/state` is reachable; only
the two mutating routes return HTTP 404.

## Authorization

Out of the box, only **superusers** can read v2 indices — they're created
hidden and no Kibana feature privilege grants access. To allow specific users:

1. Define an Elasticsearch role with `read` on the index pattern.
2. Map the role to the user via Kibana role management or the ES `_security` API.

Sample role:

```json
PUT _security/role/cases_analytics_reader
{
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [".cases"],
      "privileges": ["read"],
      "allow_restricted_indices": true
    }
  ]
}
```

A future Kibana-side provider (built on the `ImplicitPrivilegesProvider` SPI
tracked in [elastic/elasticsearch#147176](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/147176))
will scope which case documents a user can read inside `.cases` via DLS on
the top-level `space_id` + `owner` fields. These are deliberately placed at
the document root (not under `case.*`) to match the implicit-privileges DLS
convention — `space_id` is singular because cases are space-isolated. Until
that provider lands, role-granted access to `.cases` is unrestricted across
cases — apply with care.

## Data views (per-space)

A managed data view named `Cases` is bootstrapped **per space**, lazily, on
the first Cases request in that space. The id is
`cases-analytics-managed-<spaceId>`, scoped to `namespaces: [<spaceId>]`.

**Why per-space, not global.** The runtime field map is derived from template
SOs — which are themselves space-scoped. A global data view would merge every
space's runtime fields into one view, with three problems on tenants with
many spaces:

- field-picker bloat for analysts (they see thousands of fields, most
  irrelevant to their space),
- cross-space naming collisions (two spaces declaring the same
  `riskScore_as_long` for different concepts; last-write-wins resolution is
  non-deterministic),
- info leakage of field names across space boundaries.

Per-space scoping fixes all three. The underlying `.cases` index stays
cluster-level — only the view is scoped.

**Bootstrap timing.** First Cases request in a space triggers the ensure.
After that, subsequent requests skip via an in-memory cache. A new template
in a space won't appear in that space's runtime fields until either a Kibana
process restart or an administrator `/reset`.

**Cross-space analytics.** No global data view is shipped. An administrator
who needs a cross-space dashboard can duplicate the per-space view (saving
it without the `managed` flag), edit it to use `namespaces: ['*']`, and
curate
the runtime fields they want to keep. Out of scope for the managed feature.

**DLS interaction.** A future Kibana-side provider (built on the
`ImplicitPrivilegesProvider` SPI tracked in
[elastic/elasticsearch#147176](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/147176))
will scope which case documents a user can read inside `.cases` (and
`.cases-activity`) via DLS on the top-level `space_id` + `owner` fields —
placed at the document root on both surfaces to match the implicit-privileges
DLS convention. Until that lands, role-granted access is unrestricted (see
"Authorization" above). The per-space data view
is orthogonal — it scopes the _runtime field set_, not the document set. The
two compose cleanly: a user in space A sees only space-A runtime fields
**and** (once DLS is enforced) only space-A case.

## Runtime field lift

Each template-declared extended field is stored at
`case.extended_fields.<name>_as_<type>` inside a `flattened` mapping, with
a typed runtime field published at `case.<name>_as_<type>` — Lens and
Discover get numeric / date / boolean filter operators instead of
string-contains. The runtime field reads the value via
`doc['case.extended_fields.<name>_as_<type>']` at query time (flattened
sub-keys are doc-values-backed under the parent's value stream).

`flattened` is used (not `dynamic_template`-per-key) so the index mapping
stays at one field for `extended_fields` regardless of how many distinct
snake-keys exist across templates cluster-wide. With per-key dynamic
mappings, a tenant with many templates trips ES's default
`index.mapping.total_fields.limit` (1000). The trade-off is per-doc
`_source` decode cost at query time vs `doc_values` — small for the
volumes this surface is sized for, and the runtime path was already on
the hot path for typed lookup.

## Schema

The `.cases` index mapping mirrors the cases SO mapping at
`server/saved_object_types/cases/cases.ts` with these deliberate divergences:

- **`status` and `severity`**: SO stores numeric enums; v2 converts to human
  strings (`"low"`, `"open"`, etc.) in the doc-builder so Lens shows readable
  labels.
- **`observables`**: SO stores nested `[{ typeKey, value, description }]`; v2
  denormalizes to per-type keyword arrays — `case.observables.url: ["..."]`,
  `case.observables.ipv4: [...]`. Type↔value relationship preserved via the
  field path; `description` dropped (free text, not an analytics dimension).
- **`extended_fields`**: SO uses `flattened`; v2 matches. Runtime fields
  at `case.<snake>` parse the raw string from `_source` at query time
  (see "Runtime field lift" above for the field-limit rationale).
- **`time_to_acknowledge` / `time_to_investigate` / `time_to_resolve` /
  `in_progress_at`**: present in the SO's persisted attributes but not the SO
  mapping (the SO uses `dynamic: false`); v2 maps them explicitly because
  they power SLA dashboards.
- **`settings`**: stored opaque (`enabled: false`). Per-case config isn't an
  analytics dimension.

The mapping is `dynamic: 'strict'` — any field the doc-builder emits that
isn't declared fails the write with `mapper_parsing_exception`. A
schema-drift guard test round-trips a fully-populated synthetic case and
asserts every emitted path resolves in the mapping (see
`mappings/schema_drift.test.ts`).

## Operations

### Health check

```
GET /internal/cases/_analyticsV2/state
```

Returns the enabled flag, per-surface index info (with backwards-
compatible top-level cases fields), and the reconciliation task's last
run + per-surface cursors. Superuser only.

Example response:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "index": ".cases",
  "index_exists": true,
  "surfaces": {
    "cases": {
      "index": ".cases",
      "index_exists": true
    },
    "activity": {
      "index": ".cases-activity",
      "index_exists": true
    },
    "attachments": {
      "index": ".cases-attachments",
      "index_exists": true
    }
  },
  "reconciliation": {
    "task_type": "cases.analyticsV2.reconciliation",
    "last_run": {
      "cases_last_run_at": "2026-05-13T15:30:00.000Z",
      "activity_last_run_at": "2026-05-13T15:30:00.000Z",
      "attachments_last_run_at": "2026-05-13T15:30:00.000Z",
      "runs": 0,
      "next_run_at": "2026-05-13T16:00:00.000Z",
      "status": "idle"
    }
  },
  "active_reset": null
}
```

`active_reset` is `null` when no reset is in flight AND the most recent
reset succeeded (Task Manager auto-removes one-shot tasks on success).
A non-null value reflects either an in-flight reset or the most recent
failed one.

**Live progress.** During the walk, the reset task's wall-clock-throttled
progress writer flushes the partial state to the task SO every ~30
seconds. Administrators polling `/state` see the cumulative
`cases_processed` / `activity_processed` / `attachments_processed`
counts tick up live, and the `phase` field discriminates which surface
is currently being walked:

```json
"active_reset": {
  "task_id": "cases-analyticsV2-reset",
  "status": "running",
  "scheduled_at": "2026-05-13T16:02:00.000Z",
  "attempts": 1,
  "state": {
    "phase": "attachments",
    "cases_processed": 50000,
    "activity_processed": 312000,
    "attachments_processed": 18000,
    "started_at": "2026-05-13T16:02:13.000Z"
  }
}
```

**Final state.** When the walk completes, Task Manager writes the full
`ResetTaskState` from the runner's return value (including
`cases_cursor`, `activity_cursor`, `attachments_cursor`,
`completed_at`, and any per-surface error messages) and then — on
success — removes the SO. The brief window between the final write
and the SO removal is when consumers polling `/state` see
`phase: "completed"`. After the SO removal, `active_reset` returns to
`null`. On total failure (every surface threw) the SO is preserved
with `status: "failed"` and the most-recent throttled state intact
(so `phase` shows which surface died and the `*_processed` counts
show how far the walks got). On partial failure (e.g. attachments
threw mid-walk but cases + activity completed), the SO returns
`status: "ok"` with the surviving cursors set and the failed
surface's `*_error` populated for the administrator to triage.

If `enabled: true` but any `index_exists` is `false`, the
corresponding bootstrap (`ensureCaseIndex` / `ensureActivityIndex` /
`ensureAttachmentsIndex`) hit an error at plugin start and logged at
ERROR; check Kibana logs and consider `POST /reset`.

### Debug-mode routes (mutating)

The two routes below mutate subsystem state cluster-wide and operate
**globally** across every space even when invoked from a single
space's URL. They're gated behind a second flag:

```yaml
xpack.cases.analyticsV2.enableAdminRoutes: true # default false
```

When the flag is off, neither route is registered — requests return
HTTP 404. The read-only `GET /state` route above is registered
regardless (a future Case Settings page polls it for health info).

Lives under `analyticsV2` to keep it isolated from the v1 `analytics`
namespace.

### Re-run reconciliation immediately

```
POST /internal/cases/_analyticsV2/reconcile/run_soon
```

Triggers Task Manager's `runSoon` for the reconciliation task. Useful if you
suspect the primary write path dropped a case. **Requires
`xpack.cases.analyticsV2.enableAdminRoutes: true`.** Superuser only.

### Reset the index

```
POST /internal/cases/_analyticsV2/reset
→ 202 Accepted
{
  "data_views_deleted": 12,
  "reset_task": {
    "id": "cases-analyticsV2-reset",
    "task_type": "cases.analyticsV2.fullReset",
    "scheduled_at": "2026-05-13T16:02:00.000Z",
    "poll": "/internal/cases/_analyticsV2/state"
  },
  "surfaces": {
    "cases": { "reset": ".cases" },
    "activity": { "reset": ".cases-activity" },
    "attachments": { "reset": ".cases-attachments" }
  }
}
```

**Two-phase contract.** The destructive cleanup is synchronous (drops all
three indices, recreates them from scratch using the same bootstrap path as
plugin start, deletes every per-space managed Case Analytics data view,
clears the data view bootstrap cache). The full backfill walk that
repopulates all three indices from the SO source of truth runs
**asynchronously** in a one-shot Task Manager job
(`cases.analyticsV2.fullReset`). The route returns 202 once the synchronous
portion completes; the administrator polls `/state.active_reset` to track the
backfill. **Requires `xpack.cases.analyticsV2.enableAdminRoutes: true`.**

**Why async.** At ~1K+ spaces the backfill walk runs for many minutes, and
at 10K+ spaces it can run for over an hour — well past any reasonable HTTP
request budget. Running the walk in a dedicated Task Manager job means:

- `/reset` returns in seconds at any tenant size.
- The walk is durable across Kibana node restarts (Task Manager re-claims
  a stuck task on another node).
- Two `/reset` calls can't race — the second call removes the in-flight reset
  task SO before scheduling its own (latest-wins).
- The walk timeout is configurable per tenant
  (`resetTaskTimeoutMinutes`) instead of capped by the HTTP request
  timeout.
- A configurable inter-page delay (`resetPageDelayMs`) lets administrators throttle
  bulk-write pressure on shared clusters.

**Polling for completion.** While the backfill task is running,
`/state.active_reset.status` reports `"running"`. On success, Task Manager
auto-removes the task SO and `/state.active_reset` returns `null`. On total
failure (both surfaces threw), the SO is preserved with `status: "failed"`
and `state.cases_error` / `state.activity_error` populated. A partial failure
(one surface succeeded, the other threw) is treated as success at the task
level — the per-surface error lands in Kibana logs at WARN. The seed step
omits the failed surface's cursor, so the next periodic tick falls back to
a full walk of that surface and recovers any docs the partial reset missed.

Use for mapping migrations, recovery from sustained writer failures, or
administrator-initiated full backfills. Superuser only.

**Per-space data views after `/reset`.** `/reset` deletes every managed
`Case Analytics` data view across all spaces (the SOs the cluster needs to
walk and remove are namespace-scoped, so this is unavoidable for a
correct reset). Data views are recreated **lazily** on the first cases
request in each space — opening the Cases UI or hitting any cases API
endpoint (e.g. `GET /api/cases/_find`) triggers the bootstrap and the
data view appears within seconds.

That means users in spaces that had a data view before `/reset` see "no
data view found" in Discover/Lens until someone exercises Cases in that
space. For an active space the gap is usually invisible (the first
person to load the Cases page recreates it). For spaces that are
rarely-visited but still need the analytics dashboard available
post-reset (e.g. audit / compliance views polled by a scheduled job),
the recommended workflow after a `/reset` is:

1. Wait for `/state.active_reset` to return `null` (reset task
   completed and `.cases` is repopulated).
2. For each space whose data view you want to pre-warm, hit any cases
   API endpoint in that space:
   ```bash
   curl -k -H 'kbn-xsrf: true' -H 'x-elastic-internal-origin: kibana' \
     "http://<kibana>/s/<spaceId>/api/cases/_find?perPage=1"
   ```
   The bootstrap runs in the request handler before the response
   returns. A successful 200 means the data view has been recreated
   for that space.

Eager recreation of pre-existing data views inside the `/reset` flow
itself was considered and deferred — `/reset` is intentionally rare,
and the implementation cost (bypassing the data views factory to write
SOs cross-namespace from an unscoped internal client) wasn't justified
for a workflow that's already an administrator-initiated, infrequent
operation.

### Tuning `/reset` at scale

Two configuration knobs control the post-reset backfill's behaviour:

| Setting | Default | Bounds | Effect |
| ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| `xpack.cases.analyticsV2.resetTaskTimeoutMinutes` | `60` | `5`–`1440` (24h) | Wall-clock budget for the one-shot reset task. Task Manager kills the task and marks it failed if it exceeds this. |
| `xpack.cases.analyticsV2.resetPageDelayMs` | `0` | `0`–`5000` | Inter-page sleep (in ms) between reconciliation runner pages. `0` = no throttle (runners still yield via `setImmediate`). |

**Sizing the timeout.** The backfill walk is `O(documents)` not `O(spaces)` —
what matters is total case + user-action volume. Approximate wall-clock at
typical tenant shapes (default `resetPageDelayMs: 0`):

| Tenant scale | Cases | User-actions | Wall-clock | `resetTaskTimeoutMinutes` |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| ≤ 100 spaces | ~5K | ~150K | < 2 min | `60` (default) |
| ~1K spaces | ~50K | ~1.5M | ~10 min | `60` (default) |
| ~5K spaces | ~250K | ~7.5M | ~40 min | `60` (default; tight margin) |
| ~10K spaces | ~500K | ~15M | ~75 min | `120` recommended |
| ≥ 25K spaces | ~1.25M | ~37.5M | ~3 hours | `240` recommended |

Numbers are extrapolated from a 3-space measurement of ~100 cases / ~1500 user-actions per space. Real tenants will vary — the WARN log line `cases-analyticsV2: reset failed: ... task timeout exceeded` is the signal to raise the timeout.

**Sizing the page delay.** A non-zero delay halves (at 50ms) or thirds (at 100ms) the sustained ES bulk-write rate the backfill puts on the cluster, at proportional cost to wall-clock. The default `0` is the right call for most administrators — set this above zero only when the backfill is observably impacting concurrent workloads on a shared ES cluster:

| `resetPageDelayMs` | Effect at 10K-space backfill |
| --- | --- |
| `0` (default) | ~75 min wall-clock, ~3,300 docs/sec sustained ES write rate |
| `50` | ~200 min, ~1,250 docs/sec |
| `100` | ~325 min, ~770 docs/sec |
| `500` | ~22 hours, ~190 docs/sec |

Always raise `resetTaskTimeoutMinutes` first if you raise `resetPageDelayMs` — a higher delay means a longer walk, which needs a bigger budget. The 24-hour timeout ceiling means tenants beyond ~10K-space scale running with high page delays may need the partitioned-walk architecture described under "Beyond 10K spaces" below.

**Beyond 10K spaces.** The architecture runs the entire backfill on a single Kibana node (Task Manager dedupes by task ID). At very large tenant sizes (~25K+ spaces) the walk becomes CPU-bound on doc-build and ES bulk serialization, so a single node's throughput is the limiting factor. The fix is to partition the walk across spaces — multiple reset tasks each handling a contiguous slice, running on different Kibana nodes. Not implemented today.

**PIT lifetime caveat.** The reset task's reconciliation runners hold a Point-In-Time snapshot open for the duration of each surface's walk. At multi-hour walks this prevents ES from merging segments that fall behind the snapshot's view, which can affect merge cadence and disk usage on busy clusters. Mitigation if you observe segment-merge stalls during a long backfill: drop the task timeout to a few hours (forcing a fresh PIT after each timeout) and let the periodic task fill in the residual delta — slower convergence but lighter merge pressure.

### Failure modes

| Symptom                                         | Likely cause                           | Action                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cases-analyticsV2: write failed [...]` at WARN | Transient ES blip                      | Reconciliation will repair within 30 min                        |
| Sustained write failures on every case event    | Mapping conflict (e.g. drifted schema) | Inspect mapping; consider POST /reset                           |
| Reconciliation tick logs `processed=0` forever  | Task state cursor stuck in the future  | POST /reset (clears state + repopulates)                        |
| Runtime fields missing from `Cases` data view   | Template SOs have no extended fields   | Check template SOs; reconciliation tick re-syncs runtime fields |

### Templates migration coupling

The cases templates v2 migration (`server/tasks/templates_migration`)
backfills `extended_fields` onto existing cases. That backfill writes
through a raw saved-objects `bulkUpdate`, which stamps the
**SO-framework** top-level `updated_at` but **not** the **case-domain**
`attributes.updated_at`. Incremental reconciliation filters on
`attributes.updated_at` (see `reconciliation/runner.ts`), so it would
**never** re-emit backfilled cases on its own — the miss would be
permanent, not a transient window, until the case's next real edit.

To close this, the migration fires a one-shot hook when its case
backfill reaches a terminal state (fully complete **or** gives up after
the failure cap). The hook calls
`CasesAnalyticsV2Service.triggerBackfillReconciliation()`, which
**schedules the dedicated full-reset task** — the same
`cases.analyticsV2.fullReset` task that `POST /reset` uses (see "Reset
the index"). That task re-walks every case with `lastRunAt: undefined`,
mirroring the freshly backfilled `extended_fields` into `.cases`, and
seeds the periodic cursors on completion so reconciliation returns to
incremental mode.

We deliberately route through the reset task rather than clearing the
periodic reconciliation cursor. The periodic task is tuned for
`O(delta)` ticks — no inter-page throttle, Task Manager's default
timeout — so forcing a full walk through it would run unthrottled and,
on a tenant large enough to exceed that timeout, would re-walk from
scratch every tick and never settle back into incremental mode (the
periodic cursor only advances on a full successful drain). The reset
task is purpose-built for full walks: it throttles inter-page writes
(`resetPageDelayMs`), runs under a larger configurable timeout
(`resetTaskTimeoutMinutes`), reports live progress under
`/state.active_reset`, and seeds the post-walk cursors itself.

Note the give-up case: the nudge still fires, and the reset walk
faithfully mirrors whatever is currently in the SOs — that re-indexes
the cases that _were_ backfilled but does **not** mean the backfill
succeeded for every case. Cases that never backfilled stay without
`extended_fields` until a later Kibana restart re-runs the migration to
completion (which fires the nudge again).

Safety properties (all covered by tests):

- **Restart-safe / no re-index storms.** The hook is gated on
  `hasPendingCaseBackfill(configures)`, derived from the restart-durable
  `legacyCasesMigrated` per-space flags — **not** a per-run write count.
  A no-op restart of an already-migrated cluster sees no pending work
  and triggers **no** reset. This also closes the boundary case where
  the migration's final run writes zero cases (e.g. a restart wiped the
  in-progress cursor and the last run only re-scans already-written
  cases) yet still needs to nudge analytics.
- **No feedback loop.** The reset walk reads case SOs and writes only to
  `.cases`; it never writes case SOs, so it cannot re-trigger the
  migration task.
- **No concurrent walks.** `scheduleResetTask` removes any in-flight
  reset first (singleton task id), so a nudge landing while an admin
  `/reset` is running replaces it rather than racing a second walk.
- **Decoupled + non-fatal.** The callback is dependency-injected from
  `plugin.ts`; it no-ops when analytics v2 is disabled and swallows its
  own errors (scheduling failures are logged, never propagated), so it
  can never fail or retry the migration task.

## Activity surface

`.cases-activity` mirrors the `cases-user-actions` SO — one analytics
doc per user-action, keyed on the SO id. Same fire-and-forget hook +
reconciliation backstop architecture as the cases surface, with a few
deliberate differences driven by the user-action shape:

- **Append-only.** User actions are immutable at the SO layer (`create`
  only, never `patch`). The reconciliation runner therefore filters on
  `created_at > tracker` only — no `updated_at IS NULL` branch — and
  the writer exposes only `upsertAction` / `bulkUpsertActions` on the
  write side. There is no per-action `delete` path; activity rows are
  removed only via the cascade-delete path described next.
- **Cascade on case delete.** When a case is deleted, the SO layer
  cascades to its user-action SOs. Reconciliation walks forward in
  time and never sees the gap, so the activity writer exposes a
  `bulkDeleteActionsByCaseIds` path that runs a `delete_by_query` on
  `case.id`. `CasesService.deleteCase` and `bulkDeleteCaseEntities`
  dispatch this immediately after the SO delete succeeds.
- **Polymorphic payload + curated extracts.** The user-action
  `attributes.payload` shape is union-typed by `attributes.type`. The
  doc-builder strict-maps a small set of curated extracts
  (`action.status_new`, `action.severity_new`, `action.assignees_changed`,
  `action.tags_changed`, `action.connector_id_new`) for the common
  analytical pivots, AND stringifies the full payload as
  `action.payload_json` (`wildcard`, no length cap) so analysts
  can dig into any payload sub-field via ES|QL `MV_FROM_JSON` without
  per-type mapping churn. `wildcard` (not `keyword`) is deliberate: a
  `keyword` past `ignore_above` silently drops the value from the index
  and doc values, so an oversized payload (large bulk-edit) would read
  back as `null` in ES|QL; `wildcard` has no such cap and is built for
  large, opaque strings queried with grep-style predicates.
- **No `index.mode: lookup`.** `.cases-activity` is the **fact** table
  in the analytics model. ES|QL queries `FROM .cases-activity | LOOKUP
  JOIN .cases ON case.id`; the lookup-mode index is on the cases side.
- **Same reconciliation page size as cases (100).** User-action docs are
  smaller than case docs, but the per-page sync CPU is dominated by the
  `JSON.stringify(payload)` for the polymorphic payload field (which can
  be large for bulk-attachment or push payloads). 100 keeps the worst-
  case sync span between event-loop yields bounded; throughput is
  limited by ES bulk roundtrip latency, not page count.

The same managed `Case Analytics` data view spans every surface — its
title is `.cases,.cases-activity,.cases-attachments`, so a single
Discover / Lens selection covers all three. A `LOOKUP JOIN` from the
activity or attachments surface to the cases surface is just
`LOOKUP JOIN .cases ON case.id` against the joined view.

The reconciliation task runs all three surfaces sequentially per tick,
with **independent cursors** (`cases_last_run_at`,
`activity_last_run_at`, `attachments_last_run_at`). A sustained outage
on one surface pins only its own cursor; the others keep advancing.
`/state` reports all three, and `/reset` rebuilds all three.

## Attachments surface

`.cases-attachments` mirrors **both** the legacy `cases-comments` SO
and the new unified `cases-attachments` SO into a single analytics
index in the unified shape — see "Attachments dual-source" above. Same
fire-and-forget hook + reconciliation backstop architecture as the
cases surface, with the following deliberate differences:

- **Mutable.** Attachments support create + patch + delete. The
  reconciliation runner uses the cases-surface filter shape
  (`updated_at > tracker OR (updated_at IS MISSING AND created_at > tracker)`)
  — same null-branch logic that handles never-patched cases applies
  to never-patched attachments.
- **Dual-source walk.** The reconciliation runner unconditionally walks
  `cases-comments` first, then `cases-attachments`, both into the same
  index (both SO types are always registered — no source-type gating).
  SO ids are unique across the two types so an attachment that's been
  migrated post-write doesn't double-emit (the second walk's upsert
  overwrites by `_id`). Per-source per-space counts in the summary log
  line surface the legacy/unified split at a glance — keys are
  `legacy:<space>` / `unified:<space>`.
- **Cascade on case delete.** Same shape as the activity cascade —
  `bulkDeleteAttachmentsByCaseIds` runs a `delete_by_query` on
  `case.id` from `CasesService.deleteCase` and
  `bulkDeleteCaseEntities`. Covers both source SO types in one
  query because the analytics index is the unified normalization
  point.
- **Polymorphic data + metadata + curated extracts.** The unified
  attachment shape carries `data` (for value subtypes — user comments,
  persistable state) and `metadata` (for reference subtypes — alert
  rule attribution, file metadata) as plugin-defined
  `Record<string, JsonValue>`. The doc-builder strict-maps a curated
  set of extracts — `attachment.comment` (value subtypes),
  `attachment.alert.rule.{id,name}` + `attachment.alert.indices` (alert
  subtypes), and `attachment.event.indices` (event subtypes) — for the
  common analytical pivots, AND stringifies the full blobs as
  `attachment.data_json` / `attachment.metadata_json` (`wildcard`, no
  length cap) so analysts can reach into any plugin-defined sub-field
  via ES|QL `MV_FROM_JSON`. Only these extracts are curated; every
  other subtype's shape stays fully queryable via the JSON blobs, so no
  signal is lost by not giving each subtype its own mapped column. Same
  `wildcard`-not-`keyword` rationale as the activity surface's
  `payload_json` (a `keyword` past `ignore_above` silently drops
  oversized values from the index).
- **No `index.mode: lookup`.** `.cases-attachments` is the **fact**
  table in the analytics model, joined to `.cases` via ES|QL `LOOKUP
  JOIN .cases ON case.id`.
- **`attachment_id` normalized to `string[]`.** Reference subtypes
  carry the referenced entity ids as `string | string[]` on the SO
  shape (single-id alert vs bulk multi-id alert). The doc-builder
  normalizes to `string[]` so downstream queries don't have to
  handle the union.
