/**
 * A Lens panel with a terms aggregation and "other bucket" enabled fires its searches
 * sequentially: the terms query first, then a follow-up filter query once the first results
 * arrive. Saving the dashboard as a background search before the follow-up has fired produces a
 * session that does not yet track it, so restoring that session issues a search the session has
 * never seen. This spec verifies the two halves of how that is handled:
 *
 *   1. The restore reports the session as still running, because the untracked follow-up search
 *      joins the session and puts it back into an incomplete state.
 *   2. Once that settles, the follow-up has been added to the session — the searches count grows —
 *      and restoring again is clean: no warnings, no panel errors.
 *
 * The backend contract — that a search submitted after a session's tracked searches have already
 * completed in Elasticsearch is still recorded — is covered at the API layer in
 * `api/tests/session_searches_integration.spec.ts`.
 *
 * No shard_delay aggregation or SNAPSHOT build is required: the dashboard uses a standard terms
 * aggregation, and page.route() gives us control over ESE response timing directly.
