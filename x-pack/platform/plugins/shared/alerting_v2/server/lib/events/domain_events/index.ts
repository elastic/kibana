/**
 * Catalog of every domain event that alerting framework publishes on its in-process
 * event bus.
 *
 * This module is the single import point for code that needs to talk about
 * "alerting framework events" as a whole (e.g. when typing `EventBus<...>` or
 * `EventBusSubscriber<...>`). It re-exports each publisher's event types and
 * exposes the {@link AlertingDomainEvent} discriminated union.
 *
 * New publishers (e.g. the rule executor or dispatcher) should:
 *  1. Define their concrete event type and runtime `*_TYPE` constant inside
 *     their own domain folder (alongside the code that publishes it).
 *  2. Add a re-export here.
 *  3. Extend the {@link AlertingDomainEvent} union below.
