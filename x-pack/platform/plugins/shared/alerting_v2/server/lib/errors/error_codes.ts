 *   `x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/alerting_v2/server/lib/errors/README.md`
 *   for status / details shape per code.
 * - {@link ALERTING_LOG_CODES} — codes attached to `logger.error(...)` /
 *   `logger.warn(...)` calls for fire-and-forget failure paths (degraded but
 *   recoverable). Stable identifiers for log-based monitoring; never
 *   serialized into HTTP responses.
 *
 * Both catalogs treat renaming or removing a code as a breaking change to
 * downstream consumers (API clients in one case, observability tooling in
 * the other). Adding new codes is backwards compatible.
