# Rule Executor

> **Prerequisite:** Read the [server-level README](../../README.md) first for the plugin-wide architecture and terminology.

The rule executor is the hot path for alerting v2. It runs one rule on its Task Manager schedule, executes ES|QL, converts rows into rule events, enriches alert rules with episode state, and persists the final append-only documents into `.rule-events`.

See also: [Director](../director/README.md) and [Dispatcher](../dispatcher/README.md).

## What the rule executor owns

- Running one rule execution from start to finish
- Building the ES|QL request from rule configuration
- Streaming result rows through the execution pipeline
- Materializing breach / recovery / no-data rule events
- Invoking the director for alert rules
- Writing rule events to `.rule-events`

## What the rule executor does not own

- Notification matching or dispatch
- Policy throttling / suppression
- Long-lived alert action history

Those responsibilities belong to the dispatcher.

## Signal vs alert rules

Rules declare a `kind` of `signal` or `alert`.

- `signal` rules are observation-only. They produce rule events but skip episode lifecycle and dispatcher processing.
- `alert` rules participate in recovery semantics, episode lifecycle enrichment, and downstream notification dispatch.

That split is the most important branch in the executor.

## Architecture

The executor combines three mechanisms:

- **steps** for domain work
- **middleware** for global cross-cutting concerns
- **decorators** for step-specific wrapping when needed

```text
Task Manager
   |
   v
RuleExecutorTaskRunner
   |
   v
RuleExecutionPipeline
   |
   +--> middleware chain wraps each step
   |
   +--> WaitForResourcesStep
   +--> FetchRuleStep
   +--> ValidateRuleStep
   +--> ExecuteRuleQueryStep
   +--> CreateAlertEventsStep
   +--> CreateRecoveryEventsStep
   +--> DirectorStep
   +--> StoreAlertEventsStep
```

## The most important design detail: streaming

The executor pipeline is streaming. `ExecuteRuleQueryStep` may emit multiple result batches, and downstream steps see each batch as it flows through the pipeline.

That means:

- later steps must tolerate multiple `continue` emissions for one logical execution
- `esqlRowBatch` and `alertEventsBatch` are per-batch, not global full-run accumulators
- a step must not assume it will be called exactly once per rule run

If you are adding a new step after `ExecuteRuleQueryStep`, design it with batch semantics in mind.

## How one execution works

Each run starts with Task Manager task params:

- `ruleId`
- `spaceId`
- schedule metadata

`RuleExecutorTaskRunner` turns that into `RuleExecutionInput` with:

- `ruleId`
- `spaceId`
- `scheduledAt`
- `executionContext` for cancellation and scoped cleanup

`RuleExecutionPipeline` then:

1. creates initial pipeline state
2. wraps every step with the middleware chain
3. streams state through the ordered steps
4. halts early on domain reasons when appropriate
5. refreshes `.rule-events` after the stream completes so freshly written documents become searchable

## Rule configuration

Rules are saved objects. Relevant attributes include:

- `kind`
- `metadata`
- `schedule`
- `evaluation`
- `grouping`
- `recovery_policy`
- `state_transition`
- `no_data`
- server-managed flags such as `enabled`

The persisted shape lives in `saved_objects/schemas/rule_saved_object_attributes/`. API schemas live in `@kbn/alerting-v2-schemas`.

## Operational parameters

| Parameter | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task type | `alerting_v2:rule_executor` | [`task_definition.ts`](task_definition.ts) |
| Task timeout | `5m` | [`task_definition.ts`](task_definition.ts) |
| Schedule | Per rule | [`schedule.ts`](schedule.ts) |

## Pipeline state

`RulePipelineState` in `types.ts` is the data contract between steps.

| Field | Produced by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | Pipeline / task runner | Rule id, space id, schedule, and execution context. |
| `rule` | `FetchRuleStep` | Current rule document. |
| `queryPayload` | `ExecuteRuleQueryStep` | ES\|QL query/filter/params for the current run. |
| `esqlRowBatch` | `ExecuteRuleQueryStep` | One streamed batch of ES\|QL rows. |
| `alertEventsBatch` | Event-creation steps and director | Materialized rule events for the current batch. |

## Execution steps

Step order is defined in `setup/bind_rule_executor.ts`.

| # | Step | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `WaitForResourcesStep` | Ensure required Elasticsearch resources exist before doing work. |
| 2 | `FetchRuleStep` | Load the current rule saved object. |
| 3 | `ValidateRuleStep` | Halt early if the rule cannot run, for example because it is disabled. |
| 4 | `ExecuteRuleQueryStep` | Build and run ES\|QL, emitting streamed row batches. |
| 5 | `CreateAlertEventsStep` | Turn a row batch into breached rule events. |
| 6 | `CreateRecoveryEventsStep` | Append recovery events for alert rules when configured. |
| 7 | `DirectorStep` | Enrich alert-type events with episode state. |
| 8 | `StoreAlertEventsStep` | Persist the final batch into `.rule-events`. |

## Recovery behavior

Recovery is implemented in `CreateRecoveryEventsStep` after `CreateAlertEventsStep`, so the current batch already contains breach documents when recovery logic runs.

Recovery only applies to `kind: alert` rules.

### `no_breach` recovery

Default mode. The executor:

1. queries `.rule-events` for group hashes that still have non-inactive episode state
2. compares that active set to the current breach batch
3. emits one recovered event for each active group missing from the current breached set

### `query` recovery

If `recovery_policy.query.base` is configured, the executor runs a separate recovery ES|QL query and only emits recovery events for rows whose computed `group_hash` matches the active set.

### Summary

| Mode | Recovery is emitted when |
| --- | --- |
| `no_breach` | An active group is absent from the current breach batch. |
| `query` | A recovery query row matches a currently active group. |

Recovered documents are appended to `alertEventsBatch` before `DirectorStep` and storage.

## Severity behavior

Severity is a best-effort enrichment applied when the executor materializes
breached rule events in `CreateAlertEventsStep`.

The framework supports the following fixed severity values:

- `info`
- `low`
- `medium`
- `high`
- `critical`

Rules do **not** define arbitrary framework severities. Instead, the rule's
ES\|QL query is expected to map source data into one of the supported values and
emit that result as a `severity` column.

### How extraction works

For each breached ES\|QL row, the executor:

1. Looks for a `severity` column in the row payload returned by the ES\QL query.
2. Skips enrichment if the value is not a string.
3. Lowercases the string value.
4. Checks whether the normalized value matches the fixed supported set.
5. If it matches, writes it to the top-level event field `severity`.
6. If it does not match, leaves the top-level field unset.

### Important constraints

- Severity is only considered for `breached` events.
- `recovered` and `no_data` events do not carry severity.
- The original ES\|QL row is still stored in `data`, so `data.severity`
  is preserved even when the top-level `severity` field is absent or normalized.
- Unsupported values never fail the rule execution.

## Halt reasons

`HaltReason` is defined in `types.ts`.

| Reason | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rule_deleted` | The saved object no longer exists. |
| `rule_disabled` | The rule is present but disabled. |
| `state_not_ready` | A step ran without required upstream state. Usually indicates ordering or stream wiring misuse. |

## Middleware vs decorators

| Mechanism | Use it for | Current examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Middleware | Global cross-cutting behavior for every step | cancellation, APM, error handling |
| Decorators | Optional wrapping for selected steps | step-specific extensions without changing middleware scope |

Choose the smallest tool that matches the concern.

## When to add a new step

Add a step when you need a new domain phase in the rule execution pipeline, especially if it:

- introduces a new piece of pipeline state
- needs to happen in a precise order relative to recovery or storage
- should remain understandable as a standalone unit of work

Do **not** add a step when:

- the logic is really global middleware
- the logic belongs inside the director
- the logic is only about notifications after events are written

## Creating a new rule executor step

### Step 1: Create the step class

```typescript
import { inject, injectable } from 'inversify';
import type { PipelineStateStream, RuleExecutionStep } from '../types';
import { mapStep, requireState } from '../stream_utils';
import type { RuleResponse } from '../../rules_client';
import {
  LoggerServiceToken,
  type LoggerServiceContract,
} from '../../services/logger_service/logger_service';

@injectable()
export class MyNewStep implements RuleExecutionStep {
  public readonly name = 'my_new_step';

  constructor(
    @inject(LoggerServiceToken) private readonly logger: LoggerServiceContract
  ) {}

  public executeStream(input: PipelineStateStream): PipelineStateStream {
    return mapStep(input, async (state) => {
      const requiredState = requireState(state, ['rule']);

      if (!requiredState.ok) {
        this.logger.debug({ message: `[${this.name}] State not ready, halting` });
        return requiredState.result;
      }

      const { rule } = requiredState.state;
      const myResult = await this.doSomething(rule);

      return {
        type: 'continue',
        state: { ...requiredState.state, myNewField: myResult },
      };
    });
  }

  private async doSomething(_rule: RuleResponse): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
    return {};
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Extend pipeline state if needed

```typescript
export interface RulePipelineState {
  readonly input: RuleExecutionInput;
  readonly rule?: RuleResponse;
  readonly queryPayload?: QueryPayload;
  readonly esqlRowBatch?: ReadonlyArray<Record<string, unknown>>;
  readonly alertEventsBatch?: ReadonlyArray<AlertEvent>;
  readonly myNewField?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

### Step 3: Export and bind it in order

Add the export to `steps/index.ts`, then register it in `setup/bind_rule_executor.ts`.

```typescript
bind(RuleExecutionStepsToken).to(WaitForResourcesStep).inSingletonScope();
bind(RuleExecutionStepsToken).to(FetchRuleStep).inRequestScope();
bind(RuleExecutionStepsToken).to(ValidateRuleStep).inSingletonScope();
bind(RuleExecutionStepsToken).to(ExecuteRuleQueryStep).inRequestScope();
bind(RuleExecutionStepsToken).to(CreateAlertEventsStep).inSingletonScope();
bind(RuleExecutionStepsToken).to(MyNewStep).inSingletonScope();
bind(RuleExecutionStepsToken).to(CreateRecoveryEventsStep).inRequestScope();
bind(RuleExecutionStepsToken).to(DirectorStep).inSingletonScope();
bind(RuleExecutionStepsToken).to(StoreAlertEventsStep).inSingletonScope();
```

Binding order is execution order. Match neighboring scope conventions unless you have a clear reason not to.

### Step 4: Add focused tests

```typescript
import { MyNewStep } from './my_new_step';
import {
  collectStreamResults,
  createPipelineStream,
  createRuleExecutionInput,
  createRuleResponse,
} from '../test_utils';
import { createLoggerService } from '../../services/logger_service/logger_service.mock';

describe('MyNewStep', () => {
  it('continues with data when successful', async () => {
    const { loggerService } = createLoggerService();
    const step = new MyNewStep(loggerService);

    const stream = step.executeStream(
      createPipelineStream([
        {
          input: createRuleExecutionInput(),
          rule: createRuleResponse(),
        },
      ])
    );

    const [result] = await collectStreamResults(stream);

    expect(result.type).toBe('continue');
    expect(result.state).toHaveProperty('myNewField');
  });
});
```

## Creating new middleware

Middleware is the right extension point for global concerns like tracing, timing, or cancellation-aware instrumentation.

```typescript
import { inject, injectable } from 'inversify';
import type { RuleExecutionMiddlewareContext, RuleExecutionMiddleware } from './types';
import type { PipelineStateStream } from '../types';
import {
  LoggerServiceToken,
  type LoggerServiceContract,
} from '../../services/logger_service/logger_service';

@injectable()
export class PerformanceMiddleware implements RuleExecutionMiddleware {
  public readonly name = 'performance';

  constructor(
    @inject(LoggerServiceToken) private readonly logger: LoggerServiceContract
  ) {}

  public execute(
    ctx: RuleExecutionMiddlewareContext,
    next: (input: PipelineStateStream) => PipelineStateStream,
    input: PipelineStateStream
  ): PipelineStateStream {
    const stream = next(input);
    const logger = this.logger;

    return (async function* () {
      const start = performance.now();
      try {
        for await (const result of stream) {
          yield result;
        }
      } finally {
        logger.debug({
          message: `Step [${ctx.step.name}] took ${performance.now() - start}ms`,
        });
      }
    })();
  }
}
```

Register middleware in `setup/bind_rule_executor.ts` on `RuleExecutionMiddlewaresToken`. Binding order defines wrapping order.

## Current middleware

| Middleware | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CancellationBoundaryMiddleware` | Cooperative cancellation / abort handling |
| `ApmMiddleware` | APM spans around step execution |
| `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` | Centralized logging for step failures |

## Testing guidance

Useful coverage points:

- `steps/*.test.ts` for step-local logic
- `execution_pipeline.test.ts` for pipeline ordering and halt semantics
- middleware tests for cross-cutting behavior
- `build_alert_events.test.ts`, `queries.test.ts`, and related helpers for event/query correctness

## Safe contribution guidelines

- Preserve the streaming contract. That is the easiest place to introduce subtle bugs.
- Prefer `requireState(...)` and explicit halts over assuming a field exists.
- Keep rule execution focused on event production. If a change is really about lifecycle transitions, move toward the director. If it is really about notifications, move toward the dispatcher.
- If you change stored event shape, verify the resources schema and downstream readers together.
