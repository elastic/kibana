 * Global kill switch for the alerting engine.

 * Reads the `alerting:v2:enabled` advanced setting and halts the pipeline
 * before any work is performed when the operator has turned the engine off.
 * Halting with `engine_disabled` preserves the task instance state so that
 * execution resumes cleanly when the setting is toggled back on.
 *
 * This step must run first in the pipeline so that subsequent steps (resource
 * waits, rule fetches, ES|QL execution, etc.) are skipped entirely while the
 * engine is disabled.
