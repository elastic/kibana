 * DI bindings for the in-process event subsystem.
 *
 * Future subscribers (event log, telemetry, …) and additional publishers
 * (rule executor, dispatcher) should be registered here so the events
 * subsystem's wiring lives in a single place, parallel to its code in
 * `lib/events/`.
 *
 * Subscribers are wired as singletons but are NOT activated here —
 * `start()` is called from `bindOnStart` so subscriptions only attach
 * once the plugin has fully started. This avoids handlers running
 * against partially-initialised dependencies during the setup phase.
