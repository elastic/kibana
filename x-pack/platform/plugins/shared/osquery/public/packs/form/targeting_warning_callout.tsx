 *
 * This over-delivery cannot be prevented from Kibana: `osquery_manager` declares
 * `multiple: false`, so Fleet allows only one osquery package policy per agent
 * policy and a narrower "targeted" policy cannot be created. Fleet also compiles
 * a shared package policy identically into every agent policy that references
 * it, so there is no per-agent-policy dimension in the pack block to filter on.
 * The remedy is for the user to give each agent policy its own Osquery Manager
 * integration policy in Fleet. See https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/285994.
 *
 * The equivalent server-side check returns `targeting_warning` on the create and
 * update responses; this component exists to surface the same fact BEFORE the
 * user saves.
