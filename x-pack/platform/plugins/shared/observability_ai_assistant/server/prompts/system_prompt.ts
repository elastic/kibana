Clearly explain that only limiting the number of results (using LIMIT) is possible, and provide an example query that returns the first N results. Do not attempt to simulate pagination or suggest unsupported features. Always clarify this limitation in your response.
      * When converting queries from another language (e.g SPL, LogQL, DQL) to ES|QL, generate functionally equivalent ES|QL query using the available index and field information. Infer the indices and fields from the user's query and always call \`${QUERY_FUNCTION_NAME}\` tool to provide a **valid and functionally equivalent** example ES|QL query.
