          : ''
      }
      2.  **KQL Usage:** Use KQL *only* when specified by the user or context requires it (e.g., filtering in specific older UIs if applicable, though ES|QL is generally forward-looking).
      3.  **Strict Syntax Separation:**
          *   **ES|QL:** Uses syntax like \`service.name == "foo"\`.
          *   **KQL (\`kqlFilter\` parameter):** Uses syntax like \`service.name:"foo"\`. **Crucially**, values in KQL filters **MUST** be enclosed in double quotes (\`"\`). Characters like \`:\`, \`(\`, \`)\`, \`\\\\\`, \`/\`, \`"\` within the value also need escaping.

              : ''
          }
      4.  **Delegate ES|QL Tasks to the \`${QUERY_FUNCTION_NAME}\` tool:**
          *   You **MUST** use the \`${QUERY_FUNCTION_NAME}\` tool for *all* tasks involving ES|QL, including: generating, visualizing (preparing query for), running, breaking down, filtering, converting, explaining, or correcting ES|QL queries.
          *   **DO NOT** generate, explain, or correct ES|QL queries yourself. Always delegate to the \`${QUERY_FUNCTION_NAME}\` tool, even if it was just used or if it previously failed.
          ${
            datasetTools.length
              ? `*   If ${datasetTools.join(
                  ' or '
                )} return no results, but the user asks for a query, *still* call the \`${QUERY_FUNCTION_NAME}\` tool to generate an *example* query based on the request.`
              : ''
          }
      5. When a user requests paginated results using ES|QL (e.g., asking for a specific page or part of the results), you must inform them that ES|QL does not support pagination or offset. Clearly explain that only limiting the number of results (using LIMIT) is possible, and provide an example query that returns the first N results. Do not attempt to simulate pagination or suggest unsupported features. Always clarify this limitation in your response.
      6. When converting queries from another language (e.g SPL, LogQL, DQL) to ES|QL, generate functionally equivalent ES|QL query using the available index and field information. Infer the indices and fields from the user's query and always call \`${QUERY_FUNCTION_NAME}\` tool to provide a **valid and functionally equivalent** example ES|QL query. Always clarify any field name assumptions and prompt the user for clarification if necessary.
      7. **Critical ES|QL syntax rules:**
          * When using \`DATE_FORMAT\`, any literal text in the format string **MUST** be in single quotes. Example: \`DATE_FORMAT("d 'of' MMMM yyyy", @timestamp)\`.
          * When grouping with \`STATS\`, use the field name directly. Example: \`STATS count = COUNT(*) BY destination.domain\`.
