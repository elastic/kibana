/**
 * Kibana-specific dashboard *rendering* guidance.
 *
 * The generation core is environment-agnostic and never touches Kibana state:
 * it receives the prior dashboard payload + resolved panel configs and returns
 * a new dashboard payload. The Kibana \`${dashboardTools.generateDashboard}\`
 * tool wraps that core with attachment persistence, so the LLM works against a
 * lightweight reference (an \`attachment_id\`) instead of the heavy payload:
 * - the prior dashboard payload is read server-side from the referenced id,
 * - the generated payload is persisted as a \`${DASHBOARD_ATTACHMENT_TYPE}\`
 *   attachment server-side,
 * - the tool returns only the \`attachment_id\`, \`version\`, and a compact summary.
 *
 * This keeps the dashboard payload out of the LLM transcript: the model renders
 * by referencing the returned \`attachment_id\` (e.g. \`<render_attachment>\`)
 * rather than copying the payload into a follow-up tool call. A different
 * environment would substitute its own persistence/rendering primitives.

export const kibanaRenderingGuidance = `## Kibana Workflow

In Kibana, a dashboard request follows three stages: resolve inputs, generate (which also persists), then render.

1. **Resolve inputs**:
   - To work with a saved dashboard, search for it with \`platform.core.sml_search\`, then attach it with \`platform.core.sml_attach\` using the exact \`chunk_id\` from the search result. The attached \`${DASHBOARD_ATTACHMENT_TYPE}\` attachment is your editable working copy; pass its \`attachment_id\` to generation as \`dashboardAttachmentId\`.
   - To put an existing visualization onto a dashboard, read that visualization attachment's content with \`${attachmentTools.read}\` and pass its configuration as a \`panelConfig\` panel input (with the appropriate panel \`type\` and \`config\`). The generation core never reads attachments itself, so the visualization config must be passed by value here.
2. **Generate** (persists automatically):
   - Call ${dashboardTools.generateDashboard} with \`dashboardAttachmentId\` set to the dashboard you are editing (omit it for a new dashboard) and your batched \`operations\`. The tool reads the current payload from that reference, applies the operations, and persists the result as a \`${DASHBOARD_ATTACHMENT_TYPE}\` attachment for you.
   - It returns \`data.attachment_id\`, \`data.version\`, a compact \`data.dashboard\` summary, and optional \`data.failures\`. Do **not** pass the dashboard payload back into any tool — reference \`data.attachment_id\` instead.
3. **Render**:
   - Render the persisted attachment inline with a render-attachment tag using the returned \`attachment_id\` and \`version\`:
     \`<render_attachment id="{attachment_id}" version="{version}" />\`

## Discovering Dashboards

- When a user asks what dashboards are available, search with \`platform.core.sml_search\`.
- Use specific keywords from the user's request. For a broad listing, you may use \`keywords: ["*"]\`.
- Summarize matches in plain language by title and description, and include lightweight structure when available such as panel and section counts.
- Do **not** attach dashboards by default when only listing or comparing available dashboards.

## After Rendering

- Render only the final dashboard attachment inline, as the last part of your response, after any text. Never render individual visualization attachments during dashboard composition.
- Remember the dashboard's \`attachment_id\`. On later updates, pass the same \`attachment_id\` back as \`dashboardAttachmentId\` so generation edits the existing dashboard in place.
- Use returned panel \`id\` values for future panel removals, and section \`id\` values for future section-targeted changes.
- Never invent an \`attachment_id\`, panel \`id\`, or \`sectionId\`. Reuse values returned by prior tool results.
- If the generation result includes \`data.failures\`, explain which panel creations failed and report each returned \`type\`, \`identifier\`, and \`error\`.

## Rendering Edge Cases

- If the user asks to update a dashboard but no \`attachment_id\` is available in conversation context, ask which dashboard they mean or offer to create a new one.
- If generation fails, surface the returned error message rather than retrying blindly.`;
