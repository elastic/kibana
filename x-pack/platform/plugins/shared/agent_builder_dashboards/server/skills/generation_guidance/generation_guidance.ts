The ${dashboardTools.generateDashboard} tool applies the changes you describe to the current dashboard (if any). Describe the desired result, keyed by id, rather than steps: \`title\`, \`description\`, and \`time_range\` for dashboard fields, \`sections\` and \`panels\` to create or update, \`controls\` to add, and \`remove\` for ids to delete. Everything you leave out stays unchanged. See the environment workflow below for how the current dashboard is referenced and how the result is surfaced.

## Improving an Existing Dashboard (Enhance)

When asked to enhance, improve, or clean up an existing dashboard, read \`${ENHANCE_GUIDANCE_PATH}\` with \`read_file\` before inspecting the dashboard or calling any other tool. Follow that file. It takes precedence over the create-dashboard guidance in this skill. Do not enhance without reading it.

## Describing Changes

The tool schema describes each field. The rules below cover what the schema cannot express.

Make all changes in a single ${dashboardTools.generateDashboard} call whenever possible. The tool applies them together: sections first, then panels, then controls, then removals. Place panels in a new section in the same call that creates it.

For a new dashboard, set both \`title\` and \`description\`.

For an existing dashboard:
- Edit a panel by listing its id with \`content\` of the same kind. Reorganizing or enhancing a dashboard does not require replacing panels.
- For focused edits, pass only the requested change in the \`query\` (e.g. "make the error series blue"). The chart author preserves unrelated presentation settings.
- If a requested change targets a DSL, form-based, or other non-ES|QL Lens visualization panel, explicitly tell the user direct editing is not supported and ask for confirmation before replacing that panel with a newly created ES|QL-based Lens panel.

## Panel Inputs

Each visualization request is authored in a separate context. New-panel authors do not see the dashboard attachment or other panels, so describe the measure, fields, and filters in \`query\`. Edits of existing panels receive the original configuration and queries automatically through the panel id.

- Use \`source: "request"\` to create or edit a Lens, Vega, or custom content panel from a natural-language query — this is the only way to make a **new** generated panel.
- Use \`source: "attachment"\` to place a visualization that \`${platformCoreTools.createVisualization}\` already returned in this conversation. A \`source: "request"\` would generate a **new**, different panel instead.
- Use \`source: "config"\` for panels you author by value: markdown and ML anomaly panels.

## Panel Type Selection

Choose the panel type in this priority order:

1. **Lens** (\`source: "request"\`, \`renderer: "lens"\` or omit renderer) — default for metric, time series, bar, line, pie, area, and data table visualizations.
2. **Vega** (\`source: "request"\`, \`renderer: "vega"\`) — for scatter/bubble plots, small multiples/faceting, layered or combination charts, or when the user explicitly asks for Vega.
3. **Markdown** (\`source: "config"\`, \`type: "markdown"\`) — for static explanatory text, links, or simple formatted notes with no data.
4. **Custom content** (\`source: "request"\`, \`renderer: "custom_content"\`) — a last resort for HTML-based layouts that Lens and Vega cannot express, such as KPI scorecards with colored status badges, health/status boards, or panels that mix narrative text with live data values.

### Custom content panels

Reach for custom content only when nothing above fits:
- Any standard time series, bar, pie, metric, or data table → use Lens.
- Scatter plots, faceted charts, layered charts, combination charts → use Vega.
- Plain explanatory text with no data → use markdown.
- The content needs an HTML/CSS layout no single Lens chart type can express, or mixes narrative text with live data, or the user explicitly asks for a custom/HTML panel → use custom content.

## Chart Type Guidance

Before adding panels, pick 1–2 primary time-series XY (the overview trend that matches the title or intent).
On a new dashboard, phrase at least one and at most two of those primary time-series XY queries as "<measure> over time, show avg/min/max in the legend" (e.g. "log volume over time, show avg/min/max in the legend"). Skip categorical bar charts and queries whose measure is already AVG/MIN/MAX of a field.

## Controls

Controls are interactive filters pinned above the dashboard that let users explore data without editing queries.

**When building a new dashboard from scratch**, proactively add 3–5 \`options_list_control\` dropdowns for the most useful categorical fields. Pick fields that appear in panel \`BY\` / \`WHERE\` clauses, prefer low-cardinality keyword fields (e.g. \`service.name\`, \`host.name\`, \`env\`, \`region\`, \`kubernetes.namespace\`, \`http.response.status_code\`). Avoid high-cardinality identifiers (trace IDs, request IDs, UUIDs). Add a \`range_slider_control\` only when filtering by a numeric threshold is useful across multiple panels.

Do not add controls to dashboards already scoped to a single entity (one host, one service, etc.).

Controls query the index directly, so columns created in ES|QL (\`DISSECT\`, \`GROK\`, \`EVAL\`, \`RENAME\`) cannot back a control. Controls are optional: when no mapped field fits, add fewer controls or none.

Remove a control by listing the \`id\` from the \`controls[]\` list in the tool result in \`remove\`.

## Generation Edge Cases

- If a user wants to change a dashboard panel's content, edit it by id rather than removing and re-adding it. Edits work for ES|QL-backed Lens and Vega panels and custom content panels (\`source: "request"\` with the panel's \`renderer\`), markdown panels (\`source: "config"\`, \`type: "markdown"\`), and ML anomaly panels (\`source: "config"\`, \`type: "ml_anomaly_charts"\` / \`"ml_anomaly_swimlane"\` / \`"ml_single_metric_viewer"\`).
- A dashboard can include DSL-based, form-based, or other non-ES|QL Lens panels. Do not attempt to edit those panels directly.
- If the user asks to modify a DSL visualization or any other non-ES|QL panel, explicitly explain that direct editing is not supported, propose recreating and replacing it as a new ES|QL-based Lens chart, and ask for confirmation before you replace the existing panel.
- Never silently replace a non-ES|QL panel. Wait for explicit user confirmation before regenerating the dashboard with replacement content.`;
