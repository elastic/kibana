# Agent Builder Telemetry

This document describes the telemetry payload reported by the Agent Builder collector and the
usage counters used to build parts of that payload.

## Snapshot telemetry

The collector registers a single snapshot payload named `agent_builder`. The payload shape is
defined in `telemetry_collector.ts` as `AgentBuilderTelemetry` and is assembled in the `fetch`
function. The telemetry document is written under the `agent-builder` root in the
`agent-builder-telemetry` index (time field: `timestamp`). Below is a field-by-field description
of what is reported and how it is calculated.

### Platform metadata fields

In addition to the `agent-builder.*` payload, Kibana attaches standard metadata fields to the
telemetry document. These are not computed by the Agent Builder collector, but by the telemetry
pipeline. They include:
- Cluster and version metadata: `cluster_uuid`, `cluster-name`, `version`, `version-major-minor`.
- Cloud metadata: `cloud.*` (account ID, trial status, deployment flags, kbn UUID).
- ECE metadata: `ece.*` (account ID, kbn UUID).
- License metadata: `license.*` (UID, type, status, issue/start/expiry dates, max nodes/RUs).
- Serverless metadata: `serverless.*` (project ID, type, tier).

### custom_tools

## EBT (Event-Based Telemetry) events

The Agent Builder emits server-side EBT events via `AnalyticsService`. All IDs that could
contain user-generated content are normalized before reporting (SHA-256 prefix hashing) to

All hashes use SHA-256 truncated to the first 16 hex characters. Implementation is in
`telemetry/utils.ts`.
