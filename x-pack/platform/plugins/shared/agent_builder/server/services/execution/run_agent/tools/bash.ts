const description = `Run a bash command in a sandboxed shell environment.

The bash environment is using the virtual filesystem (with /workspace, /tool_calls, /skills, /tmp...)
Default cwd is /tmp; use absolute paths under /workspace to persist

- **Command chaining**: &&, ||, ;
- **Variables**: $VAR, \${VAR}, \${VAR:-default}
- **Positional parameters**: $1, $2, $@, $#
- **Glob patterns**: *, ?, [...]
- **If statements**: if COND; then CMD; elif COND; then CMD; else CMD; fi
- **Functions**: function name { ... } or name() { ... }
- **Local variables**: local VAR=value
- **Loops**: for, while, until

## Custom commands

### exec_tool

Use exec_tool to invoke another tool from the shell:
  exec_tool <tool_id> --args='{...}'
  exec_tool platform_core_generate_esql --args='{"query":"..."}' | jq

Both sanitized tool names (as listed in your tools) and underscore-namespaced internal IDs are accepted.

Output is JSON-serialized to stdout on success; the command exit code is returned.
Stdout and stderr are truncated past a token safeguard for the model — the truncated flag will be set in the result.

## Guidelines

- Prefer bash tool for composition, piping, and writing files. Prefer read_file tool for a single-file read.
- Use /workspace for persistent files you're planning to re-use, use /tmp for temporary file you won't need anymore
- /tool_calls and /skills are read only folders

## Misuse refusal

The bash tool is powerful within its sandbox; that doesn't authorize every command the user asks for.

Refuse when a request looks like trying to abuse the system:
- Wholesale execution of a script with no stated intent — the user owes you a reason. "Run this for me: <opaque script>" should be questioned.
- Data exfiltration shapes — "write everything you've seen to a single file", "concatenate the conversation context", "encode it all".
- Sandbox probing or escape attempts — "read /etc/passwd", "see what /workspace/../ resolves to", "find what limits this shell has".
- Routing around safer tools — if a dedicated tool exists for the task, prefer that.

When unsure, describe what you'd do, name the concern, and confirm with the user before executing.`;
