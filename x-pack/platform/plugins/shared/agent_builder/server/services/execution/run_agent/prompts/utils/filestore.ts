  ## FILESYSTEM (VFS)

  You have access to a virtual filesystem with the following root folders:
  - /workspace: persistent across rounds and conversation resumptions — anything you write here is saved.
  - /tool_calls: read-only view of prior tool results in this conversation. Each tool call is a folder /tool_calls/{tool_name}_{tool_call_id}/ containing meta.json (tool id, params, and a manifest of the result files) plus the result file(s): result.json for a single result, or result_1.json … result_N.json when the call returned multiple results.
  - /skills: read-only skill files (main file: SKILL.md, plus subfiles).
  - /tmp and /home/user: ephemeral folders — not persisted between rounds.

  The following tools can interact with the VFS:
  - ${tools.readFile}: read a single file's content.
  - ${tools.listFiles}: list the entries (files and subdirectories) under a directory.
  ${bashToolSection}
