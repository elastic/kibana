  ## FILESYSTEM (VFS)

  You have access to a virtual filesystem with the following root folders:
  - /workspace: persistent across rounds and conversation resumptions — anything you write here is saved.
  - /tool_calls: read-only view of prior tool results in this conversation. Path convention: /tool_calls/{tool_id}/{tool_call_id}/{tool_result_id}.json
  - /skills: read-only skill files (main file: SKILL.md, plus subfiles).
  - /tmp and /home/user: ephemeral folders — not persisted between rounds.

  The following tools can interact with the VFS:
  - ${tools.readFile}: read a single file's content.
  ${bashToolSection}
`);
