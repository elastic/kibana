# Chat with an Agent Builder Agent

This skill sends a message to an Agent Builder agent via the async chat API and displays the full response including reasoning steps, tool calls, and the final answer. The user wants to chat with **$ARGUMENTS**.

## Step 1: Resolve the Agent

Run the list script to find available agents:

```bash
x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/agent_builder/.claude/skills/create-agent/scripts/list_agents.sh
```

If the script reports that it cannot detect a running Kibana instance, stop and tell the user:
> Kibana does not appear to be running. Please start Elasticsearch and Kibana first, then re-run this skill.

Match `$ARGUMENTS` to an agent ID. If there's no exact match, try matching by name (case-insensitive). If the argument clearly contains a chat message rather than an agent name (e.g., it's a full sentence), ask the user which agent to use.

## Step 2: Determine the Prompt

If the user provided a specific message or question (either as part of `$ARGUMENTS` or in the conversation), use that as the prompt.

Otherwise, use the default prompt:
> Summarize the data available to you through your tools.

## Step 3: Send the Message

Run the chat script:

```bash
x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/agent_builder/.claude/skills/chat-with-agent/scripts/chat.sh \
  --agent-id "<agent_id>" \
  --prompt "<message>"
```

This will stream SSE events from the agent and print formatted output showing:
- `[Reasoning]` — the agent's thinking process
- `[Tool Call]` — tools invoked with their parameters
- `[Tool Result]` — results returned by tools (may be truncated)
- `[Response]` — the agent's final answer

**Note:** This command may take 30-60 seconds as the agent reasons and calls tools. Use a longer timeout (e.g., 120s or 180s) when running via Bash.

## Step 4: Present the Results

Relay the agent's response to the user. Highlight:
- Which tools the agent used and what data it accessed
- The agent's final answer/summary
- Any issues (errors, empty results, timeouts)

## Important Notes

- **Always starts a new conversation** — each invocation creates a fresh conversation
- **Auto-detection** tries http/https on localhost:5601 with standard/serverless auth
- **The agent must already exist** — use `/create-agent` first if needed
- **Data source tools must be activated** — use `/activate-data-source` first if the agent needs data source access
- To override auto-detection, pass `--kibana-url` to the chat script
