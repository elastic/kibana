--- EXAMPLE ---
CONVERSATION:
user: "Hey, I'm trying to run the build.sh script but it's failing with a 'permission denied' error. Can you help?"
assistant: "It sounds like the script isn't executable. You can fix that by running 'chmod +x build.sh'. Try that and let me know if it works."

YOUR OUTPUT:
