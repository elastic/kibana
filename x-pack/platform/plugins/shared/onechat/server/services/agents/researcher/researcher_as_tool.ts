      Can be used to perform "deep search" tasks where a single query or search is not enough
      and where we need some kind of more in depth-research with multiple search requests and analysis.

      Example where the agent should be used:
        - "Summarize the changes between our previous and current work from home policy"
        - "Find the vulnerabilities involved in our latest alerts and gather information about them"
        - Any time the user explicitly asks to use this tool

      Example where the agent should not be used (in favor of more simple search tools):
        - "Show me the last 5 documents in the index 'foo'"
        - "Show me my latest alerts"

      Notes:
        - Please include all useful information in the instructions, as the agent has no other context. `,
