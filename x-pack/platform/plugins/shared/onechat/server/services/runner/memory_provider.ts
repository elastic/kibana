These queries will be used to search a database of past conversation summaries to find relevant memories for an AI agent.

Based on the provided conversation history, generate a JSON object containing the main intent, hypothetical questions a relevant memory would answer, and extracted keywords.

--- EXAMPLE ---
CONVERSATION HISTORY:
user: "I need to analyze the user engagement data from last week. Can you write a Python script to pull it from the database?"
assistant: "Sure. Here is a script that connects to the 'prod-db-1' and fetches the data. [Code Block]"
user: "I ran it, but I'm getting a connection timeout error."

YOUR OUTPUT:
{
  "main_intent_query": "Troubleshooting a Python script that gets a connection timeout error when fetching user engagement data from a production database.",
  "hypothetical_questions": [
    "How to fix a database connection timeout in a Python script?",
    "What are common causes for database connection errors?",
