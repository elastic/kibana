# Context Engine

Server-side plugin for the Context Engine.

## AI Indices API

AI indices attach a logical name to an existing user index pattern or data
stream. AI index records are stored in a hidden Kibana system index
(`.contextengine-ai-indices`), separate from the backing data.

| Method   | Path                                  | Description                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `PUT`    | `/api/context_engine/ai_index/{id}`   | Create or update an AI index    |
| `GET`    | `/api/context_engine/ai_index/{id}`   | Get an AI index by id           |
| `GET`    | `/api/context_engine/ai_index`        | List AI indices (max 100)       |
| `DELETE` | `/api/context_engine/ai_index/{id}`   | Delete an AI index              |

Notes:

- The API is gated behind the `contextEngine:enabled` advanced setting
  (disabled by default). All routes return 404 while the setting is off.
- The backing store is set via `dest`, an object of the form
  `{ "type": "data_stream" | "index", "value": "<data stream or index>" }`.
  `dest.value` must match `dest.type`. Every
  expression in `dest.value` must start with `ai-index-ds-` for data streams or
  `ai-index-idx-` for indices (e.g. `ai-index-ds-foo`, `ai-index-idx-foo*`);
  system indices are not allowed.
- `automations` is an array of `{ "type": "workflow", "value": "<name>" }`
  objects. Required, may be empty.
- `sources` is an array whose entries are one of:
  - `{ "type": "esql", "value": "<ES|QL query>" }`, or
  - `{ "type": "connector", "value": "<connector id>" }` — an action-connector
    instance id (from Stack Management → Connectors). See
    [Connector sources](#connector-sources) below.
  Required, may be empty.
- Deleting an AI index deletes **only** the AI index entry. Backing indices
  are left untouched and must be removed with the Delete index API if desired.

## Connector sources

A `connector` source references an action-connector instance whose type opts
in to the Context Engine — i.e. its spec declares `contextEngine` in
`supportedFeatureIds`. The value stored on the source is the connector
**instance id** (not the connector type). Human-readable names are resolved
at render time via the Actions API, so renaming a connector in Stack
Management does not leave a stale label on the AI index.

Which connector types are eligible is derived at runtime from the Actions
plugin's connector-types registry:

```
GET /api/actions/connector_types?feature_id=contextEngine
```

To make a new connector eligible, add `'contextEngine'` to the
`supportedFeatureIds` list on the connector spec (in `kbn-connector-specs`).
No changes to the Context Engine plugin are required.
