# Context Engine

Server-side plugin for the Context Engine.

## AI Indices API

AI indices attach a logical name to an existing user index pattern or data
stream. AI index records are stored in a hidden Kibana system index
(`.contextengine-ai-indices`), separate from the backing data.

| Method   | Path                                                            | Description                          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `PUT`    | `/api/context_engine/ai_index/{id}`                               | Create or update an AI index         |
| `GET`    | `/api/context_engine/ai_index/{id}`                               | Get an AI index by id                |
| `GET`    | `/api/context_engine/ai_index`                                    | List AI indices (max 100)            |
| `DELETE` | `/api/context_engine/ai_index/{id}`                               | Delete an AI index                   |
| `PUT`    | `/internal/context_engine/ai_index/{id}/feedback_analysis`        | Update the feedback analysis config  |

Notes:

- The API is gated behind the `contextEngine:enabled` advanced setting
  (disabled by default). All routes return 404 while the setting is off.
- The `contextEngine:feedbackLoopEnabled` (global) advanced setting gates the
  feedback loop (disabled by default): the always-scheduled hourly
  `contextEngine:signalGenerator` background task turns Agent Builder trace
  spans into per-space signals, and no-ops while the setting is off.
- The backing store is set via `dest`, an object of the form
  `{ "type": "data_stream" | "index", "value": "<data stream or index>" }`.
  `dest.value` must match `dest.type`. Every
  expression in `dest.value` must start with `ai-index-ds-` for data streams or
  `ai-index-idx-` for indices (e.g. `ai-index-ds-foo`, `ai-index-idx-foo*`);
  system indices are not allowed.
- `automations` is an array of `{ "type": "workflow", "value": "<name>" }`
  objects. Required, may be empty.
- `sources` is an array whose entries are one of:
  - `{ "type": "esql", "value": "<ES|QL query>" }`, or
  - `{ "type": "connector", "value": "<connector id>" }` — an action-connector
    instance id (from Stack Management → Connectors). See
    [Connector sources](#connector-sources) below.
  Required, may be empty.
- Deleting an AI index deletes **only** the AI index entry. Backing indices
  are left untouched and must be removed with the Delete index API if desired.
- `feedback_analysis` configures this index's feedback loop. See
  [Feedback analysis configuration](#feedback-analysis-configuration) below.

## Feedback analysis configuration

Signal *generation* is global — one background task, one advanced setting.
Signal *analysis* is per AI index, because the improvement it proposes targets
that index's KI pipeline. The configuration therefore lives on the AI index
record:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "agent_id": "my-analysis-agent",
  "schedule": { "interval": "24h" },
  "signal_time_range": { "type": "relative", "from": "now-30d" },
  "signal_filter": "tags: query_error",
  "allowed_actions": ["add_ki", "edit_ki"]
}
```

- `enabled` is *desired* state. A schedule also needs credentials bound to it,
  so the scheduler stays authoritative for whether analysis is really running.
- `agent_id` is the Agent Builder agent that analyzes this index's signals. It
  is also the agent the interactive "Analyze & improve" hand-off opens.
- `schedule.interval` defaults to `24h` and must be at least 15 minutes. Every
  run is an LLM analysis over a window of signals, so the interval is a cost
  control rather than only a scheduling detail.
- `signal_time_range` defaults to `now-30d` and is a **read filter only**: it
  narrows which signals a run selects over, and never deletes or retains
  them. A `relative` window must cover at least one schedule interval, or
  signals arriving between runs would never be analyzed. Overlapping windows
  are harmless, because re-proposals are de-duplicated downstream. An
  `absolute` window is an open-ended "since this date", so it is always
  accepted.
- `signal_filter` is KQL narrowing which signals a run analyzes, applied on top
  of `signal_time_range`. It is validated as KQL when written, so a typo cannot
  silently disable every scheduled run. It belongs here rather than in the
  generation pipeline: generation is global and stateful, so dropping a signal
  at write time would drop it for every consumer, permanently, whereas a read
  filter is per index and reversible.
- `allowed_actions` defaults to the full [improvement action
  taxonomy](common/http_api/improvement_actions.ts) and bounds what the
  analysis may propose for this index. Deployments routinely want an agent that
  may suggest KIs but never touch workflows, and an agent asked in a prompt to
  avoid an action is not prevented from taking it — so the allowed set is
  config that the apply step enforces, not prompt text. An empty list is
  observe-only: the run still reports what it found but may not propose a
  change.

The dedicated `PUT .../feedback_analysis` route replaces only this block,
leaving the rest of the record untouched. Unlike a full AI index replace it is
permitted on **managed** AI indices: their definition is owned by the plugin
that registers them, but which agent analyzes them and how often is operator
preference. Without that carve-out, the indices that ship by default would be
the only ones that could never be analyzed.

## Connector sources

A `connector` source references an action-connector instance whose type opts
in to the Context Engine — i.e. its spec declares `contextEngine` in
`supportedFeatureIds`. The value stored on the source is the connector
**instance id** (not the connector type). Human-readable names are resolved
at render time via the Actions API, so renaming a connector in Stack
Management does not leave a stale label on the AI index.

Which connector types are eligible is derived at runtime from the Actions
plugin's connector-types registry:

```
GET /api/actions/connector_types?feature_id=contextEngine
```

To make a new connector eligible, add `'contextEngine'` to the
`supportedFeatureIds` list on the connector spec (in `kbn-connector-specs`).
No changes to the Context Engine plugin are required.

## Signals

Signals are observations classified from Agent Builder traces and stored in the
per-space `context-engine-signals-<space>` index. The AI index detail page
renders a read-only **Signals** panel: a preaggregated grouped-by-tag list, a
drill-down into a group's individual signals (each with a trace waterfall in a
flyout), and an "Analyze & improve" button that opens Agent Builder when a chat
opener has been registered.

The panel is backed by two internal, read-only routes (reads run as the current
user against the current space's signals index):

| Method | Path                                      | Description                                            |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/internal/context_engine/signals/groups` | Signals grouped by tag (a terms aggregation over tags) |
| `GET`  | `/internal/context_engine/signals`        | The individual signals for a `tag` (paginated)         |

Both routes are gated by the same `contextEngine:enabled` advanced setting as
the AI index API (they return 404 while it is off).
