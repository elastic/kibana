      description: "This attribute contains the details about a specific container like, name, number_of_workers, poll, poll_interval etc. \nThe attribute 'name' is specific to a container as it describes the container name, while the fields number_of_workers, poll, poll_interval can exist both at the container level and at the global level. \nIf you have already defined the attributes globally, then you can only specify the container name in this yaml config. \nIf you want to override any specific attribute for a container, then, you can define it here. \nAny attribute defined in the yaml will override the global definitions. Please see the relevant [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-azure-blob-storage.html#attrib-containers) for further information.\n"
