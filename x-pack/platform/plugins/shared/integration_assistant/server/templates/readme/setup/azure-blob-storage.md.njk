### Collecting logs from Azure Blob Storage

#### Create a Storage account container

To create the storage account:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and create your storage account.
2. While configuring your project details, make sure you select the following recommended default settings:
   - Hierarchical namespace: disabled
   - Minimum TLS version: Version 1.2
   - Access tier: Hot
   - Enable soft delete for blobs: disabled
   - Enable soft delete for containers: disabled

3. When the new storage account is ready, you need to take note of the storage account name and the storage account access keys, as you will use them later to authenticate your Elastic applicationâ€™s requests to this storage account.

##### How many Storage account containers?

The Elastic Agent can use one Storage account container for all integrations.

#### Running the integration behind a firewall

When you run the Elastic Agent behind a firewall, to ensure proper communication with the necessary components, you need to allow traffic on port `443` for the Storage Account container.

##### Storage Account Container

Port `443` is used for secure communication with the Storage Account container. This port is commonly used for HTTPS traffic. By allowing traffic on port 443, the Elastic Agent can securely access and interact with the Storage Account container, which is essential for storing and retrieving checkpoint data for each event hub partition.
