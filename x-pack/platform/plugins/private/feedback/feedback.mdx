## Introduction

Feedback plugin, also known as One Feedback, is a universal way of giving feedback about Elastic in Kibana. It allows users to easily provide feedback and CSAT scores directly from the Kibana interface.

## How it works

Feedback plugin registers a button in the Chrome global header area which is shown when all of those criteria all met:
- feedback is globaly enabled (`core.notifications.feedback.isEnabled()`)
- telemetry is enabled (`telemetry.telemetryService.canSendTelemetry()`)
- telemetry is opted in (`telemetry.telemetryService.getIsOptedIn()`)

It also respects the global `Usage Collection` advanced setting.

Once clicked, a modal containing feedback questions and CSAT score buttons are displayed to the user. The questions are context-aware and are defined per application in `@kbn/feedback-registry` package. In case when an application has no defined questions a default set of questions is displayed.

Feedback, along with other session data, is sent using the server-side EBT `feedback_submitted` event to Elastic's telemetry cluster and stored in the `ebt-kibana-server` index.

## Using Feedback Plugin in your application

To use the Feedback Plugin in your application, you need to define questions for your application in the `@kbn/feedback-registry` package (`x-pack/platform/packages/private/feedback-registry/src/registry.ts`).

1. Go to: `x-pack/platform/packages/private/feedback-registry/src/registry.ts`
2. Define your questions, using the default ones as a reference. The registry accepts an array of objects with the following properties:

```ts
/**
 * The id of the application associated with this feedback entry, e.g. 'dashboard', 'discover'
 * or in case of deep links, the deep link id e.g. 'ml:dataVisualizer'.
 */
type FeedbackRegistryEntryId = string;

/**
 * Definition of a feedback question entry in the feedback registry.
 */
interface FeedbackRegistryEntry {
  /**
   * Unique identifier for the feedback entry.
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * Sort order for displaying the feedback entry. The lower the number, the higher it appears in the UI.
   */
  order: number;
  /**
   * The question text to be submitted with telemetry.
   */
  question: string;
  /**
   * The question text which appears in the UI.
   */
  label?: {
    i18nId: string;
    defaultMessage: string;
  };
  /**
   * Optional placeholder to show in the UI.
   */
  placeholder?: {
    i18nId: string;
    defaultMessage: string;
  };
  /**
   * Optional aria-label.
   */
  ariaLabel?: {
    i18nId: string;
    defaultMessage: string;
  };
}

type FeedbackRegistry = Map<FeedbackRegistryEntryId, FeedbackRegistryEntry[]>;
```

3. If you're unsure of your application ID:
  - Open your application's page in a browser.
  - Open the feedback form.
  - Open the browser''s developer console and paste:
    `document.querySelector('[data-app-id]')?.getAttribute('data-app-id')`
  - Press ENTER. The value returned is your application's ID.
4. Open a PR with your changes - all questions must be approved by SharedUX team.
