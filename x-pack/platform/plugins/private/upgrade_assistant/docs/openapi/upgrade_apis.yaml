      summary: Add a default field
      description: >
        In Elasticsearch 7.0 and later, some query types, such as simple query string, have a limit to the number of fields they can query against.
        To configure the cap in Elasticsearch, set the `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count` cluster setting, which is 1024 by default.
        
        For indices with more fields than the cap, add the `index.query.default_field` index setting to inform Elasticsearch which fields to use by default when no field is specified for a query.
        Use the add default field API to add the `index.query.default_field` setting to an Elasticsearch index.
        
        To add the `index.query.default_field` index setting to the specified index, Kibana generates an array of all fields from the index mapping.
        The fields contain the types specified in `fieldTypes`.
        Kibana appends any other fields specified in `otherFields` to the array of default fields.

        Start a new reindex or resume a paused reindex.
        The following steps are performed during a reindex task:
        
        1. Set the index to read-only.
        1. Create a new index.
        1. Reindex documents into the new index.
        1. Create an index alias for the new index.
        1. Delete the old index.
