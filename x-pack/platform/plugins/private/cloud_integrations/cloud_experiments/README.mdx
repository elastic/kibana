# Kibana Cloud Experiments Service

> [!NOTE]  
> This plugin no-longer exposes any evaluation APIs. Refer to <DocLink id="kibFeatureFlagsService" /> for more information about how to interact with feature flags.

This plugin takes care of instrumenting the LaunchDarkly feature flags provider, and registering it in the <DocLink id="kibFeatureFlagsService" />.
It also instantiates the most basic evaluation context that our segmentation rules can rely on.  

The `cloudExperiments` plugin is disabled by default and only enabled on Elastic Cloud deployments.

## Evaluation Context

The fields populated by this plugin in the evaluation context are shown in the JSON snippet below.
It reports the context split in 2 levels: `kibana` and `organization`. This should help providing a consistent behavior
for all users in a deployment/project, or for all the deployments in an organization.

```JSON
