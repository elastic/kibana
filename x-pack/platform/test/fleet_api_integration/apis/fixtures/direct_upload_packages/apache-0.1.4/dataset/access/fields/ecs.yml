    For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
    For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
    If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.

      HTTP request method.
      Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided:
      "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying."
      As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the original case of the method may be useful in anomaly detection.  Original case will be mandated in ECS 2.0.0

      Original log level of the log event.
      If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity).
      Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`.

      Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.
      Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.
