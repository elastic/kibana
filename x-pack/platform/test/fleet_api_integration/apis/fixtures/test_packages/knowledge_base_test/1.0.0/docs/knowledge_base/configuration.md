# Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to configure the Knowledge Base Test integration for optimal performance and functionality.

## Basic Configuration

### Required Settings

The following settings are required for the integration to function:

- **Log File Paths**: Specify the paths to log files you want to monitor
- **Data Stream**: Configure the target data stream for collected logs

### Optional Settings

These settings can be configured based on your requirements:

- **Parsing Rules**: Custom log parsing configurations
- **Filtering Rules**: Include/exclude patterns for log entries
- **Buffer Settings**: Memory and disk buffer configurations

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Parsing Rules

You can define custom parsing rules for specific log formats:

```yaml
processors:
  - dissect:
      tokenizer: '%{timestamp} %{level} %{message}'
      field: 'message'
      target_prefix: 'parsed'
```

### Performance Tuning

For high-volume environments, consider these optimizations:

1. **Batch Size**: Increase batch size for better throughput
2. **Buffer Size**: Adjust memory buffers for peak loads
3. **Harvester Limits**: Set appropriate limits for file harvesters

## Data Stream Configuration

Configure data streams to organize your data effectively:

- Use namespace to separate environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Configure index lifecycle management policies
- Set up appropriate index templates

## Security Considerations

When configuring the integration:

1. Use least-privilege principles for file access
2. Encrypt data in transit and at rest
3. Configure proper authentication for Fleet enrollment
4. Regular rotate certificates and keys

## Monitoring and Alerting

Set up monitoring for the integration:

- Monitor data ingestion rates
- Alert on collection failures
- Track agent health and connectivity
- Monitor resource usage

This ensures reliable operation and quick identification of issues.
