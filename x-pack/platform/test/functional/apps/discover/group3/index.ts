/**
 * Migration recommendation: DELETE this index and ./config.ts once every file below is resolved.
 * The config adds no suite-specific server args on top of ../../../config.base.ts, and the Scout
 * targets (the Discover module's own configs and
 * x-pack/platform/plugins/private/discover_enhanced/test/scout) already exist.
 *
 * Audit summary — see each file for the per-test rationale:
 * - saved_queries: MIXED (1 migrate, 1 delete)
 * - saved_searches: DELETED (both tests were already ported to Scout)
 * - visualize_field: MIXED (12 tests; 2 delete, 2 hand to Lens, rest migrate)
 * - value_suggestions: DELETED (fully ported to Scout)
 * - value_suggestions_non_timebased: DELETED (fully ported to Scout)
 * - saved_search_embeddable: MIXED (1 delete, 1 cover with unit test, 3 migrate)
 * - esql_starred: MIXED, mostly covered by existing jest and Scout API tests
 * - rule_creation: cover with a unit test, then DELETE
