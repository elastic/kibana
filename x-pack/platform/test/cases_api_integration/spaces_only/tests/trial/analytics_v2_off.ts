/**
 * Regression guard for the "v1 unaffected when v2 is off" guarantee.
 *
 * This suite runs under the main `spaces_only/config.ts`, where the v2
 * feature flag is at its default (`xpack.cases.analyticsV2.enabled: false`).
 * The proxy / noop-writer wiring in `cases_analytics_v2/service.ts` already
 * makes this correct in code — every writer call funnels through a stable
 * proxy that delegates to `V2_NOOP_WRITER` when the flag is off, and SO
 * services accept that proxy unconditionally. The explicit integration
 * assertion here exists so a future change that breaks the noop contract
 * (e.g. removing the proxy, accidentally constructing the real writer
 * unconditionally) fails loudly instead of silently regressing the
 * "deployments not using v2 are untouched" promise.
