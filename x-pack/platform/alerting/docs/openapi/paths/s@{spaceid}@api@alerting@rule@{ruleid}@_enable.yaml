  summary: Enables a rule.
  operationId: enableRule
  description: >
    To enable a rule, you must have `all` privileges for the appropriate Kibana features, depending on the `consumer` and `rule_type_id` of the rule.
    For example, the **Management > Stack Rules** feature, **Analytics > Discover** and **Machine Learning** features, **Observability**, and **Security** features.
    This API supports both key- and token-based authentication.
    To use key-based authentication, create an API key in Kibana and use it in the header of the API call.
    To use token-based authentication, provide a username and password; an API key that matches the current privileges of the user is created automatically.
    In both cases, the API key is subsequently used for authorization when the rule runs.
