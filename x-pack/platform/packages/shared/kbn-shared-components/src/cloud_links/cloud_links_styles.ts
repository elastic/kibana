 * The pill is an atomic unit: its contents never wrap, so it moves to the next line of

 * `line-height: 1` keeps the intrinsic content height at the 16px icon so the box still
 * measures 24px, and `min-block-size` lets a longer translation or a larger font grow the
 * background instead of spilling the links outside it.
