# @kbn/change-history

Generic change-history storage and query for Kibana.

Persists point-in-time snapshots of object changes to Elasticsearch data streams, with optional diff metadata (what changed between consecutive versions).

Solution-agnostic: use it from any plugin or module that needs audit-style history.

---

## Overview

**One client per (module, dataset)**:

- Each client writes to a single data stream: `.kibana-change-history-{module}-{dataset}`.

**Log changes** with `log` / `logBulk`:

- Pass a **change** (or array of changes) and an **options** object. Each change has `id`, `type`, `next` (post-change snapshot), and optional `current` (pre-change snapshot).
- When `change.current` is provided, a diff is computed (using the optional custom `diffDocCalculation` or a default).

**Query history** with `getHistory(objectType, objectId, additionalFilters?)`:

- Returns change documents for that object (newest first), optionally narrowed by extra ES query filters.

All persisted documents follow the same schema (see below).

## API

### Client

- **`new ChangeHistoryClient({ module, dataset, logger, kibanaVersion })`**
  Constructs a client for the given `module`, `dataset`, and `kibanaVersion`. Use one client per (module, dataset).

- **`initialize(elasticsearchClient)`**
  Creates/ensures the data stream and stores the internal client. Call once before `log` / `logBulk` / `getHistory`.

- **`log(change, opts)`**
  Writes one change document. `change` must have `id`, `type`, and `next` (post-change snapshot); `current` (pre-change snapshot) is optional and used to compute diff fields when provided. `opts` is `LogChangeHistoryOptions` (see below).

- **`logBulk(changes, opts)`**
  Same as `log` for multiple changes in one bulk request. When `changes.length > 1`, documents are grouped with a shared event group id (or `opts.correlationId` if provided). `opts` is the same `LogChangeHistoryOptions` object.

- **`LogChangeHistoryOptions`** — Options for logging a change. Required: `action`, `userId`, `spaceId`. Optional: `correlationId` (groups bulk events when set), `overrides` (partial `event` and `metadata` to merge into the document), `excludeFields` (nested key/value map to exclude fields from the diff), `sensitiveFields` (nested key/value map for fields to hash instead of store in plain form), `diffDocCalculation` (function `(params: ChangeTrackingDiffParameters) => ChangeTrackingDiff`; when omitted, a default diff is used).

- **`getHistory(objectType, objectId, additionalFilters?)`**
  Returns a promise with `{ startDate?, total, items }` for the given object, sorted by `@timestamp` descending. Optional `additionalFilters` is an array of Elasticsearch query clause objects (`QueryDslQueryContainer[]`) that are combined with the object id/type filters (e.g. to filter by date range or user).

### Elasticsearch mapping schema

The data stream uses `dynamic: false` and the following index mapping (defined by `changeHistoryMappings` in the package):

| Field              | Type               | Description                                                                                       |

Variable-shape fields (`object.oldvalues`, `object.snapshot`, `metadata`) are currently mapped as objects with empty `properties`; the index does not use `dynamic: true`, so only explicitly mapped fields are indexed.

## Usage example

```ts
import { ChangeHistoryClient } from '@kbn/change-history';
import type { ObjectChange, LogChangeHistoryOptions } from '@kbn/change-history';

const client = new ChangeHistoryClient({
  module: 'my-module',
  dataset: 'my-dataset',
  logger,
  kibanaVersion: '9.4.0',
});
await client.initialize(elasticsearchClient);

// After an object create/update:
const change: ObjectChange = {
  id: ruleId,
  type: 'alerting-rule',
  current: previousSnapshot, // optional; if set, diff is computed
  next: newSnapshot,
};
const opts: LogChangeHistoryOptions = {
  action: 'rule-update',
  userId,
  spaceId,
  excludeFields: { someEphemeralField: false },
  diffDocCalculation: myDiffFn, // optional
};
await client.log(change, opts);

// To read history
const { startDate, total, items } = await client.getHistory('alerting-rule', ruleId);

// To read history (optionally with extra filters, e.g. date range):
const { startDate, total, items } = await client.getHistory('alerting-rule', ruleId, [
  { range: { '@timestamp': { gte: '2024-01-01' } } },
]);

console.log(
  `Change tracking started on ${startDate}, there are currently ${items.length} versions available`
);
```
