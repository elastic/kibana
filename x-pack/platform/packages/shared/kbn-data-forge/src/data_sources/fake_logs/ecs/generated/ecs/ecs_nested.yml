        This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
        the event was generated by the source.

        If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
        by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

        Required field for all events.'

        For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be
        concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.

event:
  description: 'The event fields are used for context information about the log or
    metric event itself.

    A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log
    events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events
    include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source
    to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being
    initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical
    measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric
    events include memory pressure measured on a host and device temperature. See
    the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional details about metric
    and state events.'
  fields:
    event.code:
      dashed_name: event-code
      description: 'Identification code for this event, if one exists.

        Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless
        of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is
        the Windows Event ID.'

    event.dataset:

      description: 'Name of the dataset.

        If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access
        log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes
        from.

        It''s recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module
        name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.'

        If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process
        events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain
        the name of this module.'

log:
  description: 'Details about the event''s logging mechanism or logging transport.

    The log.* fields are typically populated with details about the logging mechanism
    used to create and/or transport the event. For example, syslog details belong
    under `log.syslog.*`.

    The details specific to your event source are typically not logged under `log.*`,
    but rather in `event.*` or in other ECS fields.'
  fields:
    log.level:
      dashed_name: log-level
      description: 'Original log level of the log event.

        If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this
        is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn''t specify one,
        you may put your event transport''s severity here (e.g. Syslog severity).

        Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`.'
