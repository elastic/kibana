        This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
        the event was generated by the source.

        If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
        by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

        Required field for all events.'

        For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be
        concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.

log:

    The log.* fields are typically populated with details about the logging mechanism
    used to create and/or transport the event. For example, syslog details belong

    The details specific to your event source are typically not logged under `log.*`,

      dashed_name: log-level
      description: 'Original log level of the log event.

        If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this
        is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn''t specify one,
        you may put your event transport''s severity here (e.g. Syslog severity).

        Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`.'
