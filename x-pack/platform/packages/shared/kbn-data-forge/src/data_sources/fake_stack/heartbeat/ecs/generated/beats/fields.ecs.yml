  description: ECS Fields.
  fields:
  - name: '@timestamp'
    level: core
    required: true
    type: date
    description: 'Date/time when the event originated.

      This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
      the event was generated by the source.

      If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
      by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

      Required field for all events.'
    example: '2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z'
    default_field: true
  - name: labels
    level: core
    type: object
    object_type: keyword
    description: 'Custom key/value pairs.

      Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects.
      All values are stored as keyword.

      Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels.'
    example: '{"application": "foo-bar", "env": "production"}'
    default_field: true
  - name: message
    level: core
    type: match_only_text
    description: 'For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized
      for viewing in a log viewer.

      For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated
      to form a human-readable summary of the event.

      If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.'
    example: Hello World
    default_field: true
  - name: tags
    level: core
    type: keyword
    ignore_above: 1024
    description: List of keywords used to tag each event.
    example: '["production", "env2"]'
    default_field: true
  - name: event
    title: Event
    group: 2
    description: 'The event fields are used for context information about the log
      or metric event itself.

      A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened.
      Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log
      events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from
      a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server
      being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or
      more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken.
      Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device
      temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional
      details about metric and state events.'
    type: group
    default_field: true
    fields:
    - name: action
      level: core
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 1024
      description: 'The action captured by the event.

        This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`.
        Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is
        normally defined by the implementer.'
      example: user-password-change
    - name: duration
      level: core
      type: long
      format: duration
      input_format: nanoseconds
      output_format: asMilliseconds
      output_precision: 1
      description: 'Duration of the event in nanoseconds.

        If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference
        between the end and start time.'
    - name: outcome
      level: core
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 1024
      description: 'This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the
        lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.

        `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a
        failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.

        Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each
        event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their
        perspective.

        Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains
        multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that
        best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event
        producer.

        Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example,
        this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`,
        or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.'
      example: success
    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 1024
      description: 'This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the
        third level in the ECS category hierarchy.

        `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along
        with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a
        level appropriate for single visualization.

        This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events
        that fall in multiple event types.'
    - name: url
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 1024
      description: 'URL linking to an external system to continue investigation of
        this event.

        This URL links to another system where in-depth investigation of the specific
        occurrence of this event can take place. Alert events, indicated by `event.kind:alert`,
        are a common use case for this field.'
      example: https://mysystem.example.com/alert/5271dedb-f5b0-4218-87f0-4ac4870a38fe
      default_field: false
  - name: log
    title: Log
    group: 2
    description: 'Details about the event''s logging mechanism or logging transport.

      The log.* fields are typically populated with details about the logging mechanism
      used to create and/or transport the event. For example, syslog details belong
      under `log.syslog.*`.

      The details specific to your event source are typically not logged under `log.*`,
      but rather in `event.*` or in other ECS fields.'
    type: group

    fields:
    - name: level
      level: core
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 1024
      description: 'Original log level of the log event.

        If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this
        is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn''t specify one,
        you may put your event transport''s severity here (e.g. Syslog severity).

        Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`.'
      example: error
    - name: logger

      description: The name of the logger inside an application. This is usually the
        name of the class which initialized the logger, or can be a custom name.
      example: org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Bootstrap
