  fields:
  - name: '@timestamp'
    level: core
    required: true
    type: date
    description: 'Date/time when the event originated.

      This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
      the event was generated by the source.

      If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
      by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

      Required field for all events.'
    example: '2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z'
    default_field: true
  - name: labels
    level: core
    type: object
    object_type: keyword
    description: 'Custom key/value pairs.

      Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects.
      All values are stored as keyword.

      Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels.'
    example: '{"application": "foo-bar", "env": "production"}'
    default_field: true
  - name: message
    level: core
    type: match_only_text
    description: 'For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized
      for viewing in a log viewer.

      For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated
      to form a human-readable summary of the event.

      If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.'
    example: Hello World
    default_field: true
  - name: tags
    level: core
    type: keyword
    ignore_above: 1024
    description: List of keywords used to tag each event.

    group: 2
    description: 'A host is defined as a general computing instance.

      ECS host.* fields should be populated with details about the host on which the
      event happened, or from which the measurement was taken. Host types include
      hardware, virtual machines, Docker containers, and Kubernetes nodes.'

    default_field: true
    fields:
    - name: name
      level: core

      description: 'Name of the host.

        It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified
        domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value
        to use.'
  - name: log
    title: Log
    group: 2
    description: 'Details about the event''s logging mechanism or logging transport.

      The log.* fields are typically populated with details about the logging mechanism
      used to create and/or transport the event. For example, syslog details belong
      under `log.syslog.*`.

      The details specific to your event source are typically not logged under `log.*`,
      but rather in `event.*` or in other ECS fields.'
    type: group
    default_field: true
    fields:
    - name: level
      level: core
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 1024
      description: 'Original log level of the log event.

        If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this
        is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn''t specify one,
        you may put your event transport''s severity here (e.g. Syslog severity).

        Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`.'
