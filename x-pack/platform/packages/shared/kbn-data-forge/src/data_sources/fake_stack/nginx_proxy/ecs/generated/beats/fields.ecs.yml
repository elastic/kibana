    required: true
    type: date
    description: 'Date/time when the event originated.

      This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
      the event was generated by the source.

      If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
      by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

      Required field for all events.'
    example: '2016-05-23T08:05:34.853Z'
    default_field: true

    level: core
    type: object
    object_type: keyword

  - name: message
    level: core
    type: match_only_text
    description: 'For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized
      for viewing in a log viewer.

      For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated
      to form a human-readable summary of the event.

      If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.'
    example: Hello World
    default_field: true
  - name: tags

    title: Log
    group: 2
    description: 'Details about the event''s logging mechanism or logging transport.

      The log.* fields are typically populated with details about the logging mechanism
      used to create and/or transport the event. For example, syslog details belong
      under `log.syslog.*`.

      The details specific to your event source are typically not logged under `log.*`,
      but rather in `event.*` or in other ECS fields.'

    fields:
    - name: level
      level: core
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 1024
      description: 'Original log level of the log event.

        If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this
        is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn''t specify one,
        you may put your event transport''s severity here (e.g. Syslog severity).

        Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`.'

      level: extended
      type: keyword
      ignore_above: 1024
      description: 'Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co".

        In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain
        name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field.

        If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC
        2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain`
        field.'
      example: www.elastic.co
