# @kbn/agent-builder-visualizations-server

Presentation-owned, server-side visualization generation engine for Agent
Builder. It builds a visualization config for the renderer chosen by the caller
(Lens or Vega — the agent decides and passes `renderer` to the
`create_visualization` tool):

- `lens/` — the Lens engine (`buildLensConfig`): chart-type selection,
  schemas, prompts, and palettes.
- `vega/` — the Vega-Lite engine (`buildVegaConfig`): authors and normalizes a
  Vega-Lite spec for requests Lens cannot express.
- `shared/` — guidance reused by both engines (e.g. ES|QL authoring instructions).
- `utils/` — small renderer-agnostic helpers.

Consumed by the `agent_builder_visualizations` and `agent_builder_dashboards`
plugins.
