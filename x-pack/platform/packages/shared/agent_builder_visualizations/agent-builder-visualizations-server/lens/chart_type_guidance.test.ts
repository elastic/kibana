      "Available chart types — choose the one that best fits the user's intent and the nature of the data being visualized:
      - metric: Displays a single numeric value, KPI, or aggregate statistic (count, sum, average) with an optional trend line. Choose for single numbers without ranges or targets.
      - gauge: Displays a single metric within a range with optional min/max/goal bounds. Choose when showing progress toward a goal or performance against thresholds (e.g. \\"CPU usage as a gauge\\", \\"sales target progress\\").
      - xy: Line, bar, or area charts with X and Y axes. Choose for time series, trends, comparisons across series, or distributions/histograms (e.g. \\"request count over time\\", \\"average CPU over time\\", \\"sales by region as a bar chart\\"). Avg/min/max *in the legend* is still xy, not a combination chart.
      - heatmap: Colors a two-dimensional grid of x/y buckets by metric magnitude. Choose when both axes are buckets (categorical or time) and color should convey density or intensity (e.g. \\"errors by service and status code\\", \\"requests by hour of day and day of week\\").
      - tag_cloud: Displays terms sized by frequency or value. Choose only when the terms are short strings (tags, status codes, country codes, browsers). Do not use for long text such as error messages, URLs, or log lines — use a table instead.
      - region_map: Choropleth map coloring geographic boundaries (country, state, county) by a metric. Choose when the data has region identifiers that join to map boundaries and a map view is expected (e.g. \\"revenue by state on a map\\").
      - data_table: Structured table with sortable columns. Choose when precise values, sortable columns, or multi-dimensional breakdowns matter more than visual patterns (e.g. \\"list top 20 hosts by CPU usage\\").
      - pie: Pie or donut showing part-to-whole proportions as slices. Choose for percentage breakdowns with a limited number of categories, ideally fewer than 7 (e.g. \\"traffic distribution by browser as a donut\\").
      - treemap: Nested rectangles where area encodes magnitude. Choose for size comparisons across many categories or hierarchical breakdowns (e.g. \\"disk usage by folder\\", \\"log volume by service and host\\").
      - waffle: Grid of small squares where the filled share encodes a proportion. Choose for intuitive single-percentage displays that read easier than pie charts (e.g. \\"percentage of requests that are errors\\").
      - mosaic: Tiled rectangles where area and position encode the joint distribution of two categorical dimensions. Choose for cross-tabulations (e.g. \\"request methods by status code\\", \\"error distribution across services and environments\\")."
