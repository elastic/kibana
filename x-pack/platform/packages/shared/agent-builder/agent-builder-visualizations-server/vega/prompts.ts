Author Vega-Lite ONLY — never raw Vega (v5). Use Vega-Lite for charts a standard Lens chart cannot express, for example faceted charts / small multiples, layered or combination charts (e.g. bars with an overlaid line), or scatter/bubble plots with an encoded size. If the request needs a diagram Vega-Lite cannot express (e.g. Sankey / flow, network, chord), build the closest chart Vega-Lite supports (such as a sorted bar chart of the top combinations) rather than attempting an unsupported diagram.

DATA SOURCE RULES:
1. Bind the data with Kibana's inline ES|QL source: a top-level "data": { "url": { "%type%": "esql", "query": <the exact query below> } }. Use the query verbatim — do not modify it; the system re-binds and validates it.
2. The spec is built around this ES|QL query; its result columns are the only fields you may reference in encodings: ${esqlQueryJson}
3. Reference each column by its exact name as produced by the query. If the query uses the time-picker params (?_tstart / ?_tend), add "%timefield%": "@timestamp" to the url so Kibana binds the time range.

Columns available in the data (reference these EXACT names):
<columns>
${formatColumns(columns)}
</columns>

ENCODING TYPES:
- Pick the correct "type" for every encoded field: "nominal" (unordered categories), "ordinal" (ordered categories), "quantitative" (continuous numbers), "temporal" (dates/times).

CHART CHOICE:
- PIE/DONUT: do NOT use "arc" marks. Prefer a sorted horizontal bar chart (it is easier to read and compare); pre-sort the categories in the ES|QL query (SORT … DESC).
- Keep the spec minimal: include only what is needed to render the requested chart. Do NOT add decorative text layers with a constant "value" (e.g. a center label that just repeats a word); a text layer must encode a real field.

COLOR:
- Use "color" only for a meaningful dimension, and do NOT hand-author a "domain"; let it derive from the data. For categorical fields prefer a built-in scheme; for quantitative fields a sequential "scheme" ("blues", "viridis") is fine.

LAYOUT & STYLE RULES:
- DO NOT set top-level "width" or "height"; the system makes the chart fill its container. Do NOT set fixed mark sizes (e.g. arc "outerRadius") that prevent the chart from filling its panel.
- Provide a clear, self-explanatory "title"; prefer it over redundant axis titles.
- SORT IN LAYERED SPECS: when a categorical axis is shared across layers, pre-sort rows in ES|QL (SORT … DESC) and set "sort": null on that encoding to avoid "conflicting sort properties" warnings.
- SHARED SCALES IN LAYERED SPECS: when multiple layers encode the same field on a shared scale (e.g. "color"), configure the "legend"/"axis"/"scale" on ONE layer only. Do NOT set "legend": null on one layer while another sets a legend for the same scale — conflicting per-layer settings trigger "Conflicting legend property" warnings.
- INDICATOR / BIG-NUMBER charts: stack the text marks in clearly separated vertical bands and NEVER center two large text marks on the same point. A single big value is safest; when adding a label or a secondary value (e.g. "Previous", "% change"), give each its own non-overlapping band and size fonts so the tallest mark cannot grow into its neighbours at any panel aspect ratio — overlapping text is hard to read.

DOTS IN FIELD NAMES:
- Vega treats an unescaped dot in a field name as nested-object access, but ES|QL columns are flat. For a column whose name contains a dot (e.g. "geo.dest"), backslash-escape every dot in "field" strings ("geo\\.dest") and use bracket access in expressions (datum['geo.dest']).

Your task is to author the visualization specification for the following request:

<user_query>
${nlQuery}
</user_query>

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON specification wrapped in a markdown code block:
\`\`\`json
{
  // your Vega-Lite specification here
}
\`\`\`

${additionalContext ?? ''}`,
    ],
    // Human message required for Bedrock to work properly
    ['human', 'Author the visualization specification.'],
  ];
};
