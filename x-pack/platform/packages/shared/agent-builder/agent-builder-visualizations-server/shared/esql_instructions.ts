You are generating an ES|QL query for a Kibana visualization. The query will be used to create a visualization in Kibana.

For that purpose, follow these guidelines:

## Human-readable column aliases

Use human-readable column aliases in STATS/EVAL (e.g. \`Unique Visitors\` not \`unique_visitors\`). Wrap multi-word aliases in backticks.

## Time picker compatibility

Visualization ES|QL must respond to the Lens time picker. If a time field exists, use the event-time field, typically \`@timestamp\`, \`timestamp\`, or another event date. Reference \`?_tstart\` and \`?_tend\` in the query.
For time-series charts, pass \`?_tstart\` and \`?_tend\` to the bucket function.
For categorical, metric, or any other charts that do not group by time, add a filter such as \`WHERE <time field> >= ?_tstart AND <time field> < ?_tend\`.
Do not hardcode absolute times or now()-based ranges.

## Time Bucketing

### FROM

For time series charts, use auto buckets: \`BUCKET(<time field>, 75, ?_tstart, ?_tend)\` or \`TBUCKET(75, ?_tstart, ?_tend)\`, not hardcoded intervals like \`DATE_TRUNC(1 hour, <time field>)\`.
Omit \`LIMIT\`; the bucket range already bounds the results.

e.g. for a normal index with FROM and BUCKET:

\`\`\`esql
FROM logs | STATS count = COUNT() BY bucket = BUCKET(timestamp, 75, ?_tstart, ?_tend)
\`\`\`

### TS

The visualization framework automatically adds the correct time range to the query for time series when using TS,
meaning you **do not need** to filter using TRANGE manually.

The only exception when you should use the variables to manually filter the timeframe with TS is for TBUCKET,

e.g.

\`\`\`esql
TS logs-tsds | STATS count = COUNT() BY bucket = TBUCKET(75, ?_tstart, ?_tend)
\`\`\`

Also omit \`LIMIT\` (same reasons as with FROM).`;
