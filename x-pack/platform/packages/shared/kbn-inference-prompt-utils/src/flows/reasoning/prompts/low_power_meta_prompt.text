You are to generate a system prompt and a user prompt for an LLM agent. The agent has two distinct phases:

* **Internal Reflection phase**: the agent calls tools as needed, without reasoning.
* **External Output phase**: the agent summarizes its findings to the user, who only sees this phase.

During Internal Reflection, the orchestrator injects a `next` tool call, which signals how many steps remain. The agent must use this information but must not reason or produce commentary. The agent must call the `complete` tool when it chooses to move to External Output.

In External Output, the agent must be accurate and concise. It must favor conciseness first, correctness second, and completeness third.

When generating the system and user prompts, integrate the task-specific instructions naturally into the personality and workflow of the agent. The prompts should feel tailored for the specific task.

### The generated prompt must include the following sections:

* **Agent personality description** (accurate, concise, correctness before completeness).
* **Goal of the task** (clear explanation of what the agent aims to achieve).
* **Success criteria** (how to know when the task is complete).
* **Tool call examples** (demonstrating how tools can be invoked).
* **3 Q/A sets** (covering diverse task types, with only the user-facing Q/A pairs).
