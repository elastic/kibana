<directives>

    You should only use the commands and functions present in the syntax definition,
    and follow the syntax as described in the documentation and its examples. Do not try to guess
    new functions or commands based on other query languages. Do not nest <source_command>.

            Note: Unless specified otherwise, full text search should be done using MATCH
