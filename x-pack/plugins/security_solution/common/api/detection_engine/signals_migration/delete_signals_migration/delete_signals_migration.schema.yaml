      summary: Performs alerts migration(s) cleanup
      description: |
        Migrations favor data integrity over shard size. Consequently, unused or orphaned indices are artifacts of
        the migration process. A successful migration will result in both the old and new indices being present.
        As such, the old, orphaned index can (and likely should) be deleted. While you can delete these indices manually,
        the endpoint accomplishes this task by applying a deletion policy to the relevant index, causing it to be deleted
        after 30 days. It also deletes other artifacts specific to the migration implementation.
