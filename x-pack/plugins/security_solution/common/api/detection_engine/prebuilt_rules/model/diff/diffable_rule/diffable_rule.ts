/**
 * Represents a normalized rule object that is suitable for passing to the diff algorithm.
 * Every top-level field of a diffable rule can be compared separately on its own.
 *
 * It's important to do such normalization because:
 *
 * 1. We need to compare installed rules with prebuilt rule content. These objects have similar but not exactly
 * the same interfaces. In order to compare them we need to convert them to a common interface.
 *
 * 2. It only makes sense to compare certain rule fields in combination with other fields. For example,
 * we combine `index` and `data_view_id` fields into a `RuleDataSource` object, so that later we could
 * calculate a diff for this whole object. If we don't combine them the app would successfully merge the
 * following values independently from each other without a conflict:
 *
 *   Base version: index=[logs-*], data_view_id=undefined
 *   Current version: index=[], data_view_id=some-data-view // user switched to a data view
 *   Target version: index=[logs-*, filebeat-*], data_view_id=undefined // Elastic added a new index pattern
 *   Merged version: index=[filebeat-*], data_view_id=some-data-view ???
 *
 * Instead, semantically such change represents a conflict because the data source of the rule was changed
 * in a potentially incompatible way, and the user might want to review the change and resolve it manually.
 * The user must either pick index patterns or a data view, but not both at the same time.
 *
 * NOTE: Every top-level field in a DiffableRule MUST BE LOGICALLY INDEPENDENT from other
 * top-level fields.
