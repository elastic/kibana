/**
 * Related integration is a potential dependency of a rule. It's assumed that if the user installs
 * one of the related integrations of a rule, the rule might start to work properly because it will
 * have source events (generated by this integration) potentially matching the rule's query.
 *
 *   NOTE: Proper work is not guaranteed, because a related integration, if installed, can be
 *   configured differently or generate data that is not necessarily relevant for this rule.
 *
 * Related integration is a combination of a Fleet package and (optionally) one of the
 * package's "integrations" that this package contains. It is represented by 3 properties:
 *
 *   - `package`: name of the package (required, unique id)
 *   - `version`: version of the package (required, semver-compatible)
 *   - `integration`: name of the integration of this package (optional, id within the package)
 *
 * There are Fleet packages like `windows` that contain only one integration; in this case,
 * `integration` should be unspecified. There are also packages like `aws` and `azure` that contain
 * several integrations; in this case, `integration` should be specified.
 *
 * @example
 * const x: RelatedIntegration = {
 *   package: 'windows',
 *   version: '1.5.x',
 * };
 *
 * @example
 * const x: RelatedIntegration = {
 *   package: 'azure',
 *   version: '~1.1.6',
 *   integration: 'activitylogs',
 * };
