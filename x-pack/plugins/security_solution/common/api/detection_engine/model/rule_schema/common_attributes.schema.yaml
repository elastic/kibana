    RequiredField:
      type: object
      description: |
        Describes an Elasticsearch field that is needed for the rule to function.

        Almost all types of Security rules check source event documents for a match to some kind of
        query or filter. If a document has certain field with certain values, then it's a match and
        the rule will generate an alert.

        Required field is an event field that must be present in the source indices of a given rule.

        @example
        const standardEcsField: RequiredField = {
          name: 'event.action',
          type: 'keyword',
          ecs: true,
        };

        @example
        const nonEcsField: RequiredField = {
          name: 'winlog.event_data.AttributeLDAPDisplayName',
          type: 'keyword',
          ecs: false,

    RelatedIntegration:
      type: object
      description: |
        Related integration is a potential dependency of a rule. It's assumed that if the user installs
        one of the related integrations of a rule, the rule might start to work properly because it will
        have source events (generated by this integration) potentially matching the rule's query.

        NOTE: Proper work is not guaranteed, because a related integration, if installed, can be
        configured differently or generate data that is not necessarily relevant for this rule.

        Related integration is a combination of a Fleet package and (optionally) one of the
        package's "integrations" that this package contains. It is represented by 3 properties:

        - `package`: name of the package (required, unique id)
        - `version`: version of the package (required, semver-compatible)
        - `integration`: name of the integration of this package (optional, id within the package)

        There are Fleet packages like `windows` that contain only one integration; in this case,
        `integration` should be unspecified. There are also packages like `aws` and `azure` that contain
        several integrations; in this case, `integration` should be specified.

        @example
        const x: RelatedIntegration = {
          package: 'windows',
          version: '1.5.x',
        };

        @example
        const x: RelatedIntegration = {
          package: 'azure',
          version: '~1.1.6',
          integration: 'activitylogs',
        };

        Added in PR #163235
        Right now we only have a single field but anticipate adding more related fields to store various
        configuration states such as `override` - where a user might say if they want only these fields to
        display, or if they want these fields + the fields we select. When expanding this field, it may look
        something like:
        ```typescript
        const investigationFields = z.object({
          field_names: NonEmptyArray(NonEmptyString),
          override: z.boolean().optional(),
