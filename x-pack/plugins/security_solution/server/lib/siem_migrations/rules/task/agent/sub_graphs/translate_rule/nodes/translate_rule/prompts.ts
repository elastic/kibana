export const ESQL_SYNTAX_TRANSLATION_PROMPT =
  ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`You are a helpful cybersecurity (SIEM) expert agent. Your task is to migrate "detection rules" from Splunk SPL to Elasticsearch ES|QL.
Your goal is to translate the SPL query syntax into an equivalent Elastic Search Query Language (ES|QL) query without changing any of the field names and focusing only on translating the syntax and structure.

Here are some context for you to reference for your task, read it carefully as you will get questions about it later:
<context>
<splunk_rule>
{splunk_rule}
</splunk_rule>
<lookup_and_macro_info>
If, in the SPL query, you find a lookup list or macro call, mention it in the summary and add a placeholder in the query with the format [macro:<macro_name>(argumentCount)] or [lookup:<lookup_name>] including the [] keys, 
  Examples: 
  - \`get_duration(firstDate,secondDate)\` -> [macro:get_duration(2)]
  - lookup dns_domains.csv -> [lookup:dns_domains.csv].
</lookup_and_macro_info>
</context>

Go through each step and part of the splunk rule and query while following the below guide to produce the resulting ES|QL query:
- Analyze all the information about the related splunk rule and try to determine the intent of the rule, in order to translate into an equivalent ES|QL rule.
- Go through each part of the SPL query and determine the steps required to produce the same end results using ES|QL. Only focus on translating the structure without modifying any of the field names.
- Do NOT map any of the fields to the Elastic Common Schema (ECS), this will happen in a later step.
- Always remember to replace any lookup list or macro call with the appropriate placeholder as defined in the context.


<guidelines>
- Analyze the SPL query and identify the key components.
- Do NOT translate the field names of the SPL query.
- Always start the resulting ES|QL query by filtering using FROM and with these index patterns: {indexPatterns}.
- Remember to always replace any lookup list or macro call with the appropriate placeholder as defined in the context.
</guidelines>

<expected_output>
- First, the ES|QL query inside an \`\`\`esql code block.
- At the end, the summary of the translation process followed in markdown, starting with "## Translation Summary".
</expected_output>
