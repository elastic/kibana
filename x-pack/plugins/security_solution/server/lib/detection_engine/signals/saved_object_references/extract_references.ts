/**
 * Extracts references and returns the saved object references.
 * How to add a new extracted references here:
 * ---
 * Add a new file for extraction named: extract_<paramName>.ts, example: extract_foo.ts
 * Add a function into that file named: extract<ParamName>, example: extractFoo(logger, params.foo)
 * Add a new line below and concat together the new extract with existing ones like so:
 *
 * const exceptionReferences = extractExceptionsList(logger, params.exceptionsList);
 * const fooReferences = extractFoo(logger, params.foo);
 * const returnReferences = [...exceptionReferences, ...fooReferences];
 *
 * Optionally you can remove any parameters you do not want to store within the Saved Object here:
 * const paramsWithoutSavedObjectReferences = { removeParam, ...otherParams };
 *
 * If you do remove params, then update the types in: security_solution/server/lib/detection_engine/signals/types.ts
 * to use an omit for the functions of "isAlertExecutor" and "SignalRuleAlertTypeDefinition"
 * @param logger Kibana injected logger
 * @param params The params of the base rule(s).
 * @returns The rule parameters and the saved object references to store.
