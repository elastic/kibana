/**
 * Extracts references and returns the saved object references.
 * NOTE: You should not have to add any new ones here at all, but this keeps consistency with the other
 * version(s) used for security_solution rules.
 *
 * How to add a new extracted references here (This should be rare or non-existent):
 * ---
 * Add a new file for extraction named: extract_<paramName>.ts, example: extract_foo.ts
 * Add a function into that file named: extract<ParamName>, example: extractFoo(logger, params.foo)
 * Add a new line below and concat together the new extract with existing ones like so:
 *
 * const legacyRuleIdReferences = legacyExtractRuleId(logger, params.ruleAlertId);
 * const fooReferences = extractFoo(logger, params.foo);
 * const returnReferences = [...legacyRuleIdReferences, ...fooReferences];
 *
 * Optionally you can remove any parameters you do not want to store within the Saved Object here:
 * const paramsWithoutSavedObjectReferences = { removeParam, ...otherParams };
 *
 * If you do remove params, then update the types in: security_solution/server/lib/detection_engine/notifications/legacy_rules_notification_alert_type.ts
 * @deprecated Once we are confident all rules relying on side-car actions SO's have been migrated to SO references we should remove this function
 * @param logger Kibana injected logger
 * @param params The params of the base rule(s).
 * @returns The rule parameters and the saved object references to store.
