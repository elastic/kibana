  "description": "Identifies command execution on a virtual machine (VM) in Azure. A Virtual Machine Contributor role lets you manage virtual machines, but not access them, nor access the virtual network or storage account they\u2019re connected to. However, commands can be run via PowerShell on the VM, which execute as System. Other roles, such as certain Administrator roles may be able to execute commands on a VM as well.",
  "false_positives": [
    "Command execution on a virtual machine may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the username, hostname, and/or resource name should be making changes in your environment. Command execution from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule."
