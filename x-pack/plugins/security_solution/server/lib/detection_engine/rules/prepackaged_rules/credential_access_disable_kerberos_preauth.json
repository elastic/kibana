  "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Kerberos Pre-authentication Disabled for User\n\nKerberos pre-authentication is an account protection against offline password cracking. When enabled, a user requesting\naccess to a resource initiates communication with the Domain Controller (DC) by sending an Authentication Server Request\n(AS-REQ) message with a timestamp that is encrypted with the hash of their password. If and only if the DC is able to\nsuccessfully decrypt the timestamp with the hash of the user\u2019s password, it will then send an Authentication Server\nResponse (AS-REP) message that contains the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to the user. Part of the AS-REP message is\nsigned with the user\u2019s password. Microsoft's security monitoring [recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4738) state that `'Don't Require Preauth' \u2013 Enabled` should not be enabled for user accounts because it weakens security for the account\u2019s Kerberos authentication.\n\nAS-REP roasting is an attack against Kerberos for user accounts that do not require pre-authentication, which means that\nif the target user has pre-authentication disabled, an attacker can request authentication data for it and get a TGT that\ncan be brute-forced offline, similarly to Kerberoasting.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the account that performed the action.\n- Check whether this user should be doing this kind of activity.\n- Investigate if the target account is privileged.\n- Contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of this activity.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Disabling pre-authentication is a bad security practice and should not be allowed in the domain. The security team\nshould map and monitor any potential benign true positives (B-TPs), especially if the target account is privileged.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Reset the target account's password if there is any risk of TGTs having been retrieved.\n- Reset the password of the origin user if the activity was not recognized by the account owner.\n- Re-enable the preauthentication option for the account.\n\n## Config\n\nThe 'Audit User Account Management' logging policy must be configured for (Success, Failure).\nSteps to implement the logging policy with Advanced Audit Configuration:\n\n```\nComputer Configuration > \nPolicies > \nWindows Settings > \nSecurity Settings > \nAdvanced Audit Policies Configuration > \nAudit Policies > \nAccount Management > \nAudit User Account Management (Success,Failure)\n```\n",
