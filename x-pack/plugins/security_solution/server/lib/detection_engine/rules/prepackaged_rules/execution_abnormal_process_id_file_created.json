On Linux, the PID files typically hold the process ID to track previous copies running and manage other tasks. Certain Linux malware use the /var/run directory for holding data, executables and other tasks, disguising itself or these files as legitimate PID files.",

    "False-Positives (FP) can appear if the PID file is legitimate and holding a process ID as intended. To differentiate, if the PID file is an executable or larger than 10 bytes, it should be ruled suspicious."

Here are some possible avenues of investigation:\n- Run the following in Osquery to quickly identify unsual PID file size: \"SELECT f.size, f.uid, f.type, f.path from file f WHERE path like '/var/run/%pid';\"\n- Examine the history of this file creation and from which process it was created by using the \"lsof\" command.\n- Examine the contents of the PID file itself, simply by running the \"cat\" command to determine if the expected process ID integer exists and if not, the PID file is not legitimate.\n- Examine the reputation of the SHA256 hash from the PID file in a database like VirusTotal to identify additional pivots and artifacts for investigation.",
