  "description": "This rule detects the use of the default Cobalt Strike Team Server TLS certificate. Cobalt Strike is software for Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations which are security assessments that replicate the tactics and techniques of an advanced adversary in a network. If using Filebeat, this rule requires the Suricata or Zeek modules. Modifications to the Packetbeat configuration can be made to include MD5 and SHA256 hashing algorithms (the default is SHA1) - see the Reference section for additional information on module configuration.",

This rule uses high-confidence atomic indicators, alerts should be investigated rapidly.",
