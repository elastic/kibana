Hijacking an application (by adding a rogue secret or certificate) with granted permissions will allow the attacker to access data that is normally protected by MFA requirements.",
  "false_positives": [
    "Service principal credential additions may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the username, hostname, and/or resource name should be making changes in your environment. Credential additions from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule."
