On Linux, the PID files typically hold the process ID to track previous copies running and manage other tasks. Certain Linux malware use the /var/run directory for holding data, executables and other tasks, disguising itself or these files as legitimate PID files.",

Here are some possible avenues of investigation:\n- Examine parent and child process relationships of the new process to determine if other processes are running.\n- Examine the /var/run directory using Osquery to determine other potential PID files with unsually large file sizes, indicative of it being an executable: \"SELECT f.size, f.uid, f.type, f.path from file f WHERE path like '/var/run/%%';\"\n- Examine the reputation of the SHA256 hash from the PID file in a database like VirusTotal to identify additional pivots and artifacts for investigation.",
