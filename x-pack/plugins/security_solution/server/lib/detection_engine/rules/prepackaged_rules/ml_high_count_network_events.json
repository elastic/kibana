  "description": "A machine learning job detected an unusually large spike in network traffic. Such a burst of traffic, if not caused by a surge in business activity, can be due to suspicious or malicious activity. Large-scale data exfiltration may produce a burst of network traffic; this could also be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Denial-of-service attacks or traffic floods may also produce such a surge in traffic.",
  "false_positives": [
    "Business workflows that occur very occasionally, and involve an unsual surge in network trafic, can trigger this alert. A new business workflow or a surge in business activity may trigger this alert. A misconfigured network application or firewall may trigger this alert."
