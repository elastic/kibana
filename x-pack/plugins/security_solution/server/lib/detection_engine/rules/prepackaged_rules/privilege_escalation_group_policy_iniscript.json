  "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Scheduled Task Execution at Scale via GPO\n\nGroup Policy Objects can be used by attackers as a mechanism for an attacker to instruct an arbitrarily large group of clients to\nexecute specified commands at startup, logon, shutdown, and logoff. This is done by creating/modifying the `scripts.ini` or \n`psscripts.ini` files. The scripts are stored in the following path: `<GPOPath>\\Machine\\Scripts\\`, `<GPOPath>\\User\\Scripts\\`\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- This attack abuses a legitimate mechanism of the Active Directory, so it is important to determine whether the activity is legitimate\nand the administrator is authorized to perform this operation.\n- Retrieve the contents of the script file, and check for any potentially malicious commands and binaries.\n- If the action is suspicious for the user, check for any other activities done by the user in the last 48 hours.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n- Verify if the execution is allowed and done under change management, and legitimate.\n\n### Related Rules\n- Group Policy Abuse for Privilege Addition - b9554892-5e0e-424b-83a0-5aef95aa43bf\n- Scheduled Task Execution at Scale via GPO - 15a8ba77-1c13-4274-88fe-6bd14133861e\n\n### Response and Remediation\n- Immediate response should be taken to validate activity, investigate, and potentially isolate activity to prevent further\npost-compromise behavior.\n\n## Config\n\nThe 'Audit Detailed File Share' audit policy is required be configured (Success Failure).\nSteps to implement the logging policy with with Advanced Audit Configuration:\n```\nComputer Configuration > \nPolicies > \nWindows Settings > \nSecurity Settings > \nAdvanced Audit Policies Configuration > \nAudit Policies > \nObject Access > \nAudit Detailed File Share (Success,Failure)\n```\n\nThe 'Audit Directory Service Changes' audit policy is required be configured (Success Failure).\nSteps to implement the logging policy with with Advanced Audit Configuration:\n```\nComputer Configuration > \nPolicies > \nWindows Settings > \nSecurity Settings > \nAdvanced Audit Policies Configuration > \nAudit Policies > \nDS Access > \nAudit Directory Service Changes (Success,Failure)\n```\n",
