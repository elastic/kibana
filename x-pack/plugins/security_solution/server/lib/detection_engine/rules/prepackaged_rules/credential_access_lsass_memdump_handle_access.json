This rule is tool agnostic as it has been validated against a host of various LSASS dump tools such as SharpDump, Procdump, Mimikatz, Comsvcs etc. It detects this behavior at a low level and does not depend on a specific tool or dump file name.",

  "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating LSASS Memory Dump Handle Access\n\nLocal Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) is a process in Microsoft Windows operating systems that is responsible\nfor enforcing security policy on the system. It verifies users logging on to a Windows computer or server, handles\npassword changes, and creates access tokens.\n\nAdversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in LSASS process memory. After a user logs on,the system\ngenerates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory. This is meant to facilitate single\nsign-on (SSO) ensuring a user isn\u2019t prompted each time resource access is requested. These credential materials can be\nharvested by an adversary using administrative user or SYSTEM privileges to conduct lateral movement using \n[alternate authentication material](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/).\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree).\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Validate the correct install path for the process that triggered this detection.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- There should be very few if any false positives for this rule. However, it may be tripped by antivirus or endpoint detection and response solutions;\ncheck whether these solutions are installed on the correct paths.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Scope compromised credentials and disable the accounts.\n- Reset passwords for the user account and other potentially compromised accounts (email, services, CRMs, etc.).\n\n## Config\n\nEnsure advanced audit policies for Windows are enabled, specifically:\nObject Access policies [Event ID 4656](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4656) (Handle to an Object was Requested)\n\n```\nComputer Configuration >\nPolicies >\nWindows Settings >\nSecurity Settings >\nAdvanced Audit Policies Configuration >\nSystem Audit Policies >\nObject Access >\nAudit File System (Success,Failure)\nAudit Handle Manipulation (Success,Failure)\n```\n\nAlso, this event generates only if the object\u2019s [SACL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists) has the required access control entry (ACE) to handle the use of specific access rights.\n\nIf enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.\n",
