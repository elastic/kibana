  "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Suspicious Startup Shell Activity\n\nTechniques used within malware and by adversaries often leverage the Windows registry to store malicious programs for\npersistence. Startup shell folders are often targeted as they are not as prevalent as normal Startup folder paths so this\nbehavior may evade existing AV/EDR solutions. Another preference is that these programs might run with higher privileges\nwhich can be ideal for an attacker.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Review the source process and related file tied to the Windows Registry entry\n- Validate the activity is not related to planned patches, updates, network administrator activity or legitimate software\ninstallations\n- Determine if activity is unique by validating if other machines in same organization have similar entry\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n- There is a high possibility of benign legitimate programs being added to Shell folders. This activity could be based\non new software installations, patches, or any kind of network administrator related activity. Before entering further\ninvestigation, this activity should be validated that is it not related to benign activity\n\n### Related Rules\n- Startup or Run Key Registry Modification\n- Persistent Scripts in the Startup Directory\n\n### Response and Remediation\n- Activity should first be validated as a true positive event if so then immediate response should be taken to review,\ninvestigate and potentially isolate activity to prevent further post-compromise behavior\n- The respective binary or program tied to this persistence method should be further analyzed and reviewed to understand\nit's behavior and capabilities\n- Since this activity is considered post-exploitation behavior, it's important to understand how the behavior was first\ninitialized such as through a macro-enabled document that was attached in a phishing email. By understanding the source\nof the attack, this information can then be used to search for similar indicators on other machines in the same environment.\n",
