  "note": "## Triage and analysis.\n\n### Investigating Potential Priivilege Escalation via InstallerFileTakeOver\n\nInstallerFileTakeOver is a weaponized EoP PoC to the CVE-2021-41379 vulnerability. Upon successful exploitation,\nan unprivileged user will escalate privileges to SYSTEM/NT AUTHORITY.\n\nThis rule detects the default execution of the PoC, which overwrites the `elevation_service.exe` DACL and copy itself\nto the location to escalate privileges. An attacker is able to still take over any file that is not in use (locked), which is outside the scope of this rule.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n\n- Check for the digital signature of the executable\n- Look for additional processes spawned by the process, command lines and network communications.\n- Look for additional alerts involving the host and the user.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- Verify whether the digital signature exists in the executable, and if it is valid.\n\n### Related Rules\n\n- Suspicious DLL Loaded for Persistence or Privilege Escalation - bfeaf89b-a2a7-48a3-817f-e41829dc61ee\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- Immediate response should be taken to validate activity, investigate and potentially isolate activity to prevent further\npost-compromise behavior.\n",
