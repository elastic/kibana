Each sink whose filter matches the log entry writes a copy of the log entry to the sink's export destination. An adversary may update a Logging sink to exfiltrate logs to a different export destination.",

    "Logging sink modifications may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user email, resource name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Sink modifications from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule."
