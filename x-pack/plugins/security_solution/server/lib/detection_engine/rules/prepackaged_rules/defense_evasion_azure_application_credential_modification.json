Multiple certificates and secrets can be added for an application and an adversary may abuse this by creating an additional authentication method to evade defenses or persist in an environment.",

Application credential additions from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule."
