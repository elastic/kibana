  "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Peripheral Device Discovery\n\nAfter successfully compromising an environment, attackers may try to gain situational awareness to plan their next steps.\nThis can happen by running commands to enumerate network resources, users, connections, files, and installed security\nsoftware.\n\nThis rule looks for the execution of the `fsutil` utility with the `fsinfo` subcommand to enumerate drives attached to\nthe computer, which can be used to identify secondary drives used for backups, mapped network drives, and removable\nmedia. These devices can contain valuable information for attackers.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files\nfor prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.\n- Identify the user account that performed the action and whether it should perform this kind of action.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Investigate any abnormal account behavior, such as command executions, file creations or modifications, and network\nconnections.\n- Determine whether this activity was followed by suspicious file access/copy operations or uploads to file storage\nservices.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Discovery activities are not inherently malicious if they occur in isolation. As long as the analyst did not identify\nsuspicious activity related to the user or host, such alerts can be dismissed.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are\nidentified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business\nsystems, and web services.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and\nmalware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the\nmean time to respond (MTTR).",
