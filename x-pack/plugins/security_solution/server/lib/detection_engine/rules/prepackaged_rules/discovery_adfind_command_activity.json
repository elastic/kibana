  "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AdFind Command Activity\n\n[AdFind](http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/) is a freely available command-line tool used to retrieve information from\nActive Directory (AD). Network discovery and enumeration tools like `AdFind` are useful to adversaries in the same ways\nthey are effective for network administrators. This tool provides quick ability to scope AD person/computer objects and\nunderstand subnets and domain information. There are many [examples](https://thedfirreport.com/category/adfind/)\nobserved where this tool has been adopted by ransomware and criminal groups and used in compromises.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- `AdFind` is a legitimate Active Directory enumeration tool used by network administrators, it's important to understand\nthe source of the activity.  This could involve identifying the account using `AdFind` and determining based on the command-lines\nwhat information was retrieved, then further determining if these actions are in scope of that user's traditional responsibilities.\n- In multiple public references, `AdFind` is leveraged after initial access is achieved. Review previous activity on impacted\nmachines for suspicious indicators such as previous anti-virus/EDR alerts, phishing emails received, or network traffic\nto suspicious infrastructure.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n- This rule has a high chance to produce false positives as it is a legitimate tool used by network administrators. One\noption could be allowlisting specific users or groups who use the tool as part of their daily responsibilities. This can\nbe done by leveraging the exception workflow in the Kibana Security App or Elasticsearch API to tune this rule to your environment.\n- Malicious behavior with `AdFind` should be investigated as part of a step within an attack chain. It doesn't happen in\nisolation, so reviewing previous logs/activity from impacted machines can be very telling.\n\n### Related Rules\n- Windows Network Enumeration\n- Enumeration of Administrator Accounts\n- Enumeration Command Spawned via WMIPrvSE\n\n### Response and Remediation\n- Take immediate action to validate activity, investigate and potentially isolate activity to prevent further\npost-compromise behavior.\n- It's important to understand that `AdFind` is an Active Directory enumeration tool and can be used for malicious or legitimate\npurposes, so understanding the intent behind the activity will help determine the appropropriate response.\n\n\n## Config\n\nIf enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.\n",
