Databases should almost never be directly exposed to the Internet, as they are frequently targeted by threat actors to gain initial access to network resources.",

    "Because these ports are in the ephemeral range, this rule may false under certain conditions such as when a NATed web server replies to a client which has used a port in the range by coincidence. In this case, such servers can be excluded if desired. Some cloud environments may use this port when VPNs or direct connects are not in use and database instances are accessed directly across the Internet."
