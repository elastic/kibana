Azure AD is extended to include collaboration, allowing you to invite people from outside your organization to be guest users in your cloud account. Unless there is a business need to provision guest access, it is best practice avoid creating guest users. Guest users could potentially be overlooked indefinitely leading to a potential vulnerability.",

    "Guest user invitations may be sent out by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the username, hostname, and/or resource name should be making changes in your environment. Guest user invitations from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule."
