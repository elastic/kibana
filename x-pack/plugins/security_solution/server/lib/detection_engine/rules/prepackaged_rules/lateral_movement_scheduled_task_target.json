  "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Creation of Remote Scheduled Tasks\n\n[Scheduled tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/about-the-task-scheduler) are a great mechanism used for persistence and executing programs. These features can\nbe used remotely for a variety of legitimate reasons, but at the same time used by malware and adversaries.\nWhen investigating scheduled tasks that have been set-up remotely, one of the first methods should be determining the\noriginal intent behind the configuration and verify if the activity is tied to benign behavior such as software installations or any kind\nof network administrator work. One objective for these alerts is to understand the configured action within the scheduled\ntask, this is captured within the registry event data for this rule and can be base64 decoded to view the value.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- Review the base64 encoded tasks actions registry value to investigate the task configured action.\n- Determine if task is related to legitimate or benign behavior based on the corresponding process or program tied to the\nscheduled task.\n- Further examination should include both the source and target machines where host-based artifacts and network logs\nshould be reviewed further around the time window of the creation of the scheduled task.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n- There is a high possibility of benign activity tied to the creation of remote scheduled tasks as it is a general feature\nwithin Windows and used for legitimate purposes for a wide range of activity. Any kind of context should be found to\nfurther understand the source of the activity and determine the intent based on the scheduled task contents.\n\n### Related Rules\n- Service Command Lateral Movement\n- Remotely Started Services via RPC\n\n### Response and Remediation\n- This behavior represents post-exploitation actions such as persistence or lateral movement, immediate response should\nbe taken to review and investigate the activity and potentially isolate involved machines to prevent further post-compromise\nbehavior.\n- Remove scheduled task and any other related artifacts to the activity.\n- Review privileged account management and user account management settings such as implementing GPO policies to further\nrestrict activity or configure settings that only allow Administrators to create remote scheduled tasks.\n",
