In GCP, the publisher-subscriber relationship (Pub/Sub) is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples event-producing and event-processing services. A subscription is a named resource representing the stream of messages to be delivered to the subscribing application.",

    "Subscription creations may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user email, resource name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Subscription creations from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule."
