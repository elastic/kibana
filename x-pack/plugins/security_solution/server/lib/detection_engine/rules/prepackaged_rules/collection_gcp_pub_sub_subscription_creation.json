In GCP, the publisher-subscriber relationship (Pub/Sub) is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples event-producing and event-processing services. A subscription is a named resource representing the stream of messages to be delivered to the subscribing application.",

Subscription creations from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule."
