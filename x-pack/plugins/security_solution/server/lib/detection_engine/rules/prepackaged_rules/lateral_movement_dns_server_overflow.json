Here are some possible avenues of investigation:\n- Investigate any corresponding Intrusion Detection Signatures (IDS) alerts that can validate this detection alert.\n- Examine the `dns.question_type` network fieldset with a protocol analyzer, such as Zeek, Packetbeat, or Suricata, for `SIG` or `RRSIG` data.\n- Validate the patch level and OS of the targeted DNS server to validate the observed activity was not large-scale Internet vulnerability scanning.\n- Validate that the source of the network activity was not from an authorized vulnerability scan or compromise assessment.",
