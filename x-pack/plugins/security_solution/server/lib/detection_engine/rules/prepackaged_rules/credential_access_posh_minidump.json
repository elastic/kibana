  "note": "## Triage and analysis.\n\n### Investigating PowerShell MiniDump Script\n\nPowerShell is one of the main tools system administrators use for automation, report routines, and other tasks. This\nmakes it available for use in various environments, and creates an attractive way for attackers to execute code.\n\nAttackers can abuse Process Memory Dump capabilities to extract credentials from LSASS or to obtain other\nprivileged information stored in the process memory.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine script content that triggered the detection. \n- Investigate the script execution chain (parent process tree).\n- Inspect any file or network events from the suspicious PowerShell host process instance.\n- Investigate other alerts related to the user/host in the last 48 hours.\n- Consider whether the user needs PowerShell to complete its tasks.\n- Check if the imported function was executed and which process it targeted.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Regular users do not have a business justification for using scripting utilities to dump process memory, making false\npositives unlikely.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- PowerShell PSReflect Script - 56f2e9b5-4803-4e44-a0a4-a52dc79d57fe\n- Potential Process Injection via PowerShell - 2e29e96a-b67c-455a-afe4-de6183431d0d\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Quarantine the involved host for forensic investigation, as well as eradication and recovery activities.\n- Configure AppLocker or equivalent software to restrict access to PowerShell for regular users.\n- Reset the password for the user account.\n\n## Config\n\nThe 'PowerShell Script Block Logging' logging policy must be enabled.\nSteps to implement the logging policy with with Advanced Audit Configuration:\n\n```\nComputer Configuration > \nAdministrative Templates > \nWindows PowerShell > \nTurn on PowerShell Script Block Logging (Enable)\n```\n\nSteps to implement the logging policy via registry:\n\n```\nreg add \"hklm\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\ScriptBlockLogging\" /v EnableScriptBlockLogging /t REG_DWORD /d 1\n```\n",
