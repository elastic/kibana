  "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Windows Defender Exclusions\n\nMicrosoft Windows Defender is an anti-virus product built-in within Microsoft Windows. Since this software product is\nused to prevent and stop malware, it's important to monitor what specific exclusions are made to the product's configuration\nsettings. These can often be signs of an adversary or malware trying to bypass Windows Defender's capabilities. One of the more\nnotable [examples](https://www.cyberbit.com/blog/endpoint-security/latest-trickbot-variant-has-new-tricks-up-its-sleeve/) was observed in 2018 where Trickbot incorporated mechanisms to disable Windows Defense to avoid detection.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps:\n- With this specific rule, it's completely possible to trigger detections on network administrative activity or benign users\nusing scripting and PowerShell to configure the different exclusions for Windows Defender. Therefore, it's important to\nidentify the source of the activity first and determine if there is any mal-intent behind the events.\n- The actual exclusion such as the process, the file or directory should be reviewed in order to determine the original\nintent behind the exclusion. Is the excluded file or process malicious in nature or is it related to software that needs\nto be legitimately whitelisted from Windows Defender?\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n- This rule has a higher chance to produce false positives based on the nature around configuring exclusions by possibly\na network administrator. In order to validate the activity further, review the specific exclusion made and determine based\non the exclusion of the original intent behind the exclusion. There are often many legitimate reasons why exclusions are made\nwith Windows Defender so it's important to gain context around the exclusion.\n\n### Related Rules\n- Windows Defender Disabled via Registry Modification\n- Disabling Windows Defender Security Settings via PowerShell\n\n### Response and Remediation\n- Since this is related to post-exploitation activity, immediate response should be taken to review, investigate and\npotentially isolate further activity\n- If further analysis showed malicious intent was behind the Defender exclusions, administrators should remove\nthe exclusion and ensure antimalware capability has not been disabled or deleted\n- Exclusion lists for antimalware capabilities should always be routinely monitored for review\n",
