  "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Scheduled Task Execution at Scale via GPO\n\nGroup Policy Objects (GPOs) can be used by attackers to execute scheduled tasks at scale to compromise objects controlled\nby a given GPO. This is done by changing the contents of the `<GPOPath>\\Machine\\Preferences\\ScheduledTasks\\ScheduledTasks.xml`\nfile.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- This attack abuses a legitimate mechanism of Active Directory, so it is important to determine whether the activity\nis legitimate and the administrator is authorized to perform this operation.\n- Retrieve the contents of the `ScheduledTasks.xml` file, and check the `<Command>` and `<Arguments>` XML tags for any\npotentially malicious commands or binaries.\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Scope which objects may be compromised by retrieving information about which objects are controlled by the GPO.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Verify if the execution is allowed and done under change management, and if the execution is legitimate.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- Group Policy Abuse for Privilege Addition - b9554892-5e0e-424b-83a0-5aef95aa43bf\n- Startup/Logon Script added to Group Policy Object - 16fac1a1-21ee-4ca6-b720-458e3855d046\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- The investigation and containment must be performed in every computer controlled by the GPO, where necessary.\n- Remove the script from the GPO.\n- Check if other GPOs have suspicious scheduled tasks attached.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the\nmean time to respond (MTTR).",
