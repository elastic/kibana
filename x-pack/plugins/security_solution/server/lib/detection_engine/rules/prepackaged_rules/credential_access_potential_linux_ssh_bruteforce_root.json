  "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Potential SSH Brute Force Attack on Privileged Account\n\nThe rule identifies consecutive SSH login failures targeting a privileged (root) account from the same source IP\naddress to the same target host indicating brute force login attempts.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Investigate the login failure on privileged account(s).\n- Investigate the source IP address of the failed ssh login attempt(s).\n- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.\n- Identify the source and the target computer and their roles in the IT environment.\n\n### False positive analysis\n- Authentication misconfiguration or obsolete credentials.\n- Service account password expired.\n- Infrastructure or availability issue.\n\n### Response and remediation\n- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.\n- Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.\n- Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are\nidentified.\n- Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials.\n- Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and\nmalware components.\n- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.\n- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the\nmean time to respond (MTTR).\n\n",
