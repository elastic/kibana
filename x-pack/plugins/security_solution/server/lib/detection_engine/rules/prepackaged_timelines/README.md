### How to on board a new prepackage timelines:



1.  [Have the env params set up](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/security_solution/server/lib/detection_engine/README.md)

2. Create a new timelines template into `x-pack/plugins/security_solution/server/lib/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged_timelines`

	##### 2.a : Create a new template from UI and export it.

	 1. Go to Security Solution app in Kibana
	 2. Go to timelines > templates > custom templates (a filter on the right)
	 3. Click `Create new timeline template`
	 4. Edit your template
	 5. Export only **one** timeline template each time and put that in `x-pack/plugins/security_solution/server/lib/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged_timelines`. (For potential update requirement in the future, we put one timeline in each file to keep nice and clear)
	 6. Rename the file extension to `.json`
	 7. Check the chapter of `Fields to hightlight for on boarding a new prepackaged timeline` in this readme and update your template




	##### 2.b : Create a new template from scratch
	Please note that below template is just an example, please replace all your fields with whatever makes sense. Do check `Fields to hightlight for on boarding a new prepackaged timeline` to make sure the template can be created as expected.

	#### Note that the json has to be minified.
	#### Fields to hightlight for on boarding a new prepackaged timeline:

	- savedObjectId: null

	- version: null

	- templateTimelineId: Specify an unique uuid e.g.: `2c7e0663-5a91-0004-aa15-26bf756d2c40`

	- templateTimelineVersion: just start from `1`

	- timelineType: `template`

	- status: `immutable`



3.  ```cd x-pack/plugins/security_solution/server/lib/detection_engine/scripts```

4.  ```sh ./timelines/regen_prepackage_timelines_index.sh```

(this will update `x-pack/plugins/security_solution/server/lib/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged_timelines/index.ndjson`)



5. Go to `http://localhost:5601/app/security#/detections/rules` and click on `Install Elastic prebuild rules`

or run

```
cd x-pack/plugins/security_solution/server/lib/detection_engine/scripts

sh ./timelines/add_prepackaged_timelines.sh

```



6. Check in UI or run the script below to see if prepackaged timelines on-boarded correctly.

```

sh ./timelines/find_timeline_by_filter.sh immutable template elastic

```



### How to update an existing prepackage timeline:

1.  ```cd x-pack/plugins/security_solution/server/lib/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged_timelines```

2. Open the json file you wish to update, and remember to bump the `templateTimelineVersion`

3. Go to ```cd x-pack/plugins/security_solution/server/lib/detection_engine/scripts```, run ```sh ./timelines/regen_prepackage_timelines_index.sh```

4. Go to `http://localhost:5601/app/security#/detections/rules` and click on `Install Elastic prebuild rules`

or run

```

sh ./timelines/add_prepackaged_timelines.sh
