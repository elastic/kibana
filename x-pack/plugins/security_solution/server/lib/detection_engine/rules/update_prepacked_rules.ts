/**
 * How many rules to update at a time is set to 50 from errors coming from
 * the slow environments such as cloud when the rule updates are > 100 we were
 * seeing timeout issues.
 *
 * Since there is not timeout options at the alerting API level right now, we are
 * at the mercy of the Elasticsearch server client/server default timeouts and what
 * we are doing could be considered a workaround to not being able to increase the timeouts.
 *
 * However, other bad effects and saturation of connections beyond 50 makes this a "noisy neighbor"
 * if we don't limit its number of connections as we increase the number of rules that can be
 * installed at a time.
 *
 * Lastly, we saw weird issues where Chrome on upstream 408 timeouts will re-call the REST route
 * which in turn could create additional connections we want to avoid.
 *
 * See file import_rules_route.ts for another area where 50 was chosen, therefore I chose
 * 50 here to mimic it as well. If you see this re-opened or what similar to it, consider
 * reducing the 50 above to a lower number.
 *
 * See the original ticket here:
 * https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/94418
