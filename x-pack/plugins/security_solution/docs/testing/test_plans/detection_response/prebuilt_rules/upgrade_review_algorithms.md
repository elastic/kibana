# Diff Algorithms for `upgrade/_review` Endpoint

This is a test plan for the `upgrade/_review` endpoint diff algorithms that are a part of the larger prebuilt rules customization feature. These algorithms determine what fields get returned when a user makes an API request to review changes as a part of the rule update process and determine what version of those fields should be displayed by the UI.

Status: `in progress`.

## Useful information

### Tickets

- [Users can customize prebuilt detection rules](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/174168) epic
- [Implement single-line string diff algorithm](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/180158)
- [Implement number diff algorithm](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/180160)
- [Implement array of scalar values diff algorithm](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/180162)

### Terminology

- **Base version**: Also labeled as `base_version`. This is the version of a rule authored by Elastic as it is installed from the `security_detection_engine` package, with no customizations to any fields by the user.

- **Current version**: Also labeled as `current_version`. This is the version of the rule that the user currently has installed. Consists of the `base_version` of the rules plus all customization applies to its fields by the user.

- **Target version**: Also labeled as `target_version`. This is the version of the rule that contains the update from Elastic.

- **Merged version**: Also labeled as `merged_version`. This is the version of the rule that we determine via the various algorithms. It could contain a mix of all the rule versions on a per-field basis to create a singluar version of the rule containing all relevant updates and user changes to display to the user.

- **Grouped fields**
  - `data_source`: an object that contains a `type` field with a value of `data_view_id` or `index_patterns` and another field that's either `data_view_id` of type string OR `index_patterns` of type string array
  - `kql_query`: an object that contains a `type` field with a value of `inline_query` or `saved_query` and other fields based on whichever type is defined. If it's `inline_query`, the object contains a `query` string field, a `language` field that's either `kuery` or `lucene`, and a `filters` field which is an array of kibana filters. If the type field is `saved_query`, the object only contains a `saved_query_id` string field.
  - `eql_query`: an object that contains a `query` string field, a `language` field that always has the value: `eql`, and a `filters` field that contains an array of kibana filters.
  - `esql_query`: an object that contains a `query` string field and a `language` field that always has the value: `esql`.

### Assumptions

- All scenarios will contain at least 1 prebuilt rule installed in Kibana.
- A new version will be available for rule(s).

## Scenarios

### Rule field doesn't have an update and has no custom value - `AAA`

#### **Scenario: `AAA` - Rule field is any type**

**Automation**: 11 integration tests with mock rules + a set of unit tests for each algorithm

```Gherkin
Given <field_name> field is not customized by the user (current version == base version)
And <field_name> field is not updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version == base version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the current version as the merged one without a conflict
And <field_name> field should not be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should not be shown in the upgrade preview UI

#### **Scenario: `ABA` - Rule field is rule `type`**

**Automation**: 1 integration test with mock rules + a set of unit tests for each algorithm

```Gherkin
Given <field_name> field is customized by the user (current version != base version)
And <field_name> field is not updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version == base version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the target version as the merged one with a non-solvable conflict
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| algorithm | field_name | base_version | current_version | target_version | merged_version |
| rule type | type       | "query"      | "saved_query"   | "query"        | "query"        |
```

Notes: `type` field can only be changed between `query` and `saved_query` rule types in the UI and API via normal conventions, but the logic for others is still covered

#### **Scenario: `ABB` - Rule field is rule `type`**

**Automation**: 1 integration test with mock rules + a set of unit tests for each algorithm

```Gherkin
Given <field_name> field is customized by the user (current version != base version)
And <field_name> field is updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version != base version)
And customized <field_name> field is the same as the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version == target version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the target version as the merged one with a non-solvable conflict
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| algorithm | field_name | base_version | current_version | target_version | merged_version |
| rule type | type       | "query"      | "saved_query"   | "saved_query"  | "saved_query"  |
```

Notes: `type` field can only be changed between `query` and `saved_query` rule types in the UI and API via normal conventions, but the logic for others is still covered

### Rule field has an update and a custom value that are NOT the same - `ABC`

#### **Scenario: `ABC` - Rule field is rule `type`**

**Automation**: 1 integration test with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithms

```Gherkin
Given <field_name> field is customized by the user (current version != base version)
And <field_name> field is updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version != base version)
And customized <field_name> field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the target version as the merged one with a non-solvable conflict
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| algorithm | field_name | base_version | current_version | target_version | merged_version |
| rule type | type       | "query"      | "saved_query"   | "threshold"    | "threshold"    |
```

Notes: `type` field can only be changed between `query` and `saved_query` rule types in the UI and API via normal conventions, but the logic for others is still covered. This test case scenario cannot currently be reached.

#### **Scenario: `ABC` - Rule field is a number or single line string**

**Automation**: 2 integration tests with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithms

```Gherkin
Given <field_name> field is customized by the user (current version != base version)
And <field_name> field is updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version != base version)
And customized <field_name> field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the current version as the merged one with a non-solvable conflict
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

#### **Scenario: `ABC` - Rule field is a mergeable multi line string**

**Automation**: 2 integration tests with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithms

```Gherkin
Given <field_name> field is customized by the user (current version != base version)
And <field_name> field is updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version != base version)
And customized <field_name> field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
And the 3-way diff of <field_name> fields are determined to be mergeable
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output a merged version as the merged one with a solvable conflict
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| algorithm         | field_name  | base_version                              | current_version                                 | target_version                                        | merged_version                                              |
| multi line string | description | "My description.\nThis is a second line." | "My GREAT description.\nThis is a second line." | "My description.\nThis is a second line, now longer." | "My GREAT description.\nThis is a second line, now longer." |
```

#### **Scenario: `ABC` - Rule field is a non-mergeable multi line string**

**Automation**: 2 integration tests with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithms

```Gherkin
Given <field_name> field is customized by the user (current version != base version)
And <field_name> field is updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version != base version)
And customized <field_name> field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
And the 3-way diff of <field_name> fields are determined to be unmergeable
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the current version as the merged one with a non-solvable conflict
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| algorithm         | field_name  | base_version                              | current_version                                 | target_version                                 | merged_version                                 |

```

#### **Scenario: `ABC` - Rule field is an array of scalar values**

**Automation**: 5 integration tests with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithm

```Gherkin

And <field_name> field is updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version != base version)
And customized <field_name> field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output a custom merged version with a solvable conflict
And arrays should be deduplicated before comparison
And arrays should be compared sensitive of case
And arrays should be compared agnostic of order
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:

And customized <field_name> field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the target version as the merged one with a solvable conflict
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

#### **Scenario: `-AB` - Rule field is an array of scalar values**

**Automation**: 1 integration test with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithm

```Gherkin
Given at least 1 installed prebuilt rule has a new version available
And the base version of the rule cannot be determined
And customized <field_name> field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output a custom merged version with a solvable conflict
And arrays should be deduplicated before comparison
And arrays should be compared sensitive of case
And arrays should be compared agnostic of order
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI


Examples:
| algorithm        | field_name | base_version | current_version        | target_version         | merged_version                 |
| array of scalars | tags       | N/A          | ["one", "two", "four"] | ["one", "two", "five"] | ["one", "two", "four", "five"] |
```

#### **Scenario: `-AB` - Rule field is a solvable `data_source` object**

**Automation**: 1 integration test with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithm

```Gherkin
Given at least 1 installed prebuilt rule has a new version available
And the base version of the rule cannot be determined
And customized data_source field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
And current version and target version are both array fields in data_source
Then for data_source field the diff algorithm should output a custom merged version with a solvable conflict
And arrays should be deduplicated before comparison
And arrays should be compared sensitive of case
And arrays should be compared agnostic of order
And data_source field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And data_source field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| algorithm    | base_version | current_version                                                     | target_version                                                     | merged_version                                                              |
| data_source  | N/A          | {type: "index_patterns", "index_patterns": ["one", "two", "three"]} | {type: "index_patterns", "index_patterns": ["one", "two", "four"]} | {type: "index_patterns", "index_patterns": ["one", "two", "three", "four"]} |

```

#### **Scenario: `-AB` - Rule field is a non-solvable `data_source` object**

**Automation**: 1 integration test with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithm

```Gherkin
Given at least 1 installed prebuilt rule has a new version available
And the base version of the rule cannot be determined
And customized data_source field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
And current version and target version are not both array fields in data_source
Then for data_source field the diff algorithm should output the target version as the merged version with a solvable conflict
And data_source field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And data_source field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| algorithm    | base_version | current_version                                                     | target_version                           | merged_version                           |
| data_source  | N/A          | {type: "index_patterns", "index_patterns": ["one", "two", "three"]} | {type: "data_view", "data_view_id": "A"} | {type: "data_view", "data_view_id": "A"} |
```

#### **Scenario: `-AB` - Rule field is rule `type`**

**Automation**: 1 integration test with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithm

```Gherkin
Given at least 1 installed prebuilt rule has a new version available
And the base version of the rule cannot be determined
And customized data_source field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
And current version and target version are not both array fields in data_source
Then for data_source field the diff algorithm should output the target version as the merged version with a non-solvable conflict
And data_source field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And data_source field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| algorithm    | base_version | current_version | target_version | merged_version |
| rule type    | N/A          | "query"         | "saved_query"  | "saved_query"  |
```

Notes: `type` field can only be changed between `query` and `saved_query` rule types in the UI and API via normal conventions, but the logic for others is still covered
