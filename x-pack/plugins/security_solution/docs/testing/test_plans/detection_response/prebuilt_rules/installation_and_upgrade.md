# Installation and Upgrade of Prebuilt Rules

This is a test plan for the workflows of installing and upgrading prebuilt rules.

Status: `in progress`. The current test plan matches `Milestone 2` of the [Rule Immutability/Customization](https://github.com/elastic/security-team/issues/1974) epic. It does not cover any past functionality that was removed or functionality to be implemented in the future. The plan is about to change in the future Milestones.

## Useful information

### Tickets

- [Rule Immutability/Customization](https://github.com/elastic/security-team/issues/1974) epic
- [Ensure full test coverage for existing workflows of installing and upgrading prebuilt rules](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/148176)
- [Write test plan and add test coverage for the new workflows of installing and upgrading prebuilt rules](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/148192)
- [Document the new UI for installing and upgrading prebuilt detection rules](https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/issues/3496)

### Terminology

- **EPR**: [Elastic Package Registry](https://github.com/elastic/package-registry), service that hosts our **Package**.

- **Package**: `security_detection_engine` Fleet package that we use to distribute prebuilt detection rules in the form of `security-rule` assets (saved objects).

- **Real package**: actual latest stable package distributed and pulled from EPR via Fleet.

- **Mock rules**: `security-rule` assets that are indexed into the `.kibana_security_solution` index directly in the test setup, either by using the ES client _in integration tests_ or by an API request _in Cypress tests_.

- **Air-gapped environment**: an environment where Kibana doesn't have access to the internet. In general, EPR is not available in such environments, except the cases when the user runs a custom EPR inside the environment.

- **CTA**: "call to action", usually a button, a link, or a callout message with a button, etc, that invites the user to do some action.
  - CTA to install prebuilt rules - at this moment, it's a link button with a counter (implemented) and a callout with a link button (not yet implemented) on the Rule Management page.
  - CTA to upgrade prebuilt rules - at this moment, it's a tab with a counter (implemented) and a callout with a link button (not yet implemented) on the Rule Management page.

### Assumptions

- Below scenarios only apply to prebuilt detection rules.
- Users should be able to install and upgrade prebuilt rules on the `Basic` license and higher.
- EPR is available for fetching the package unless explicitly indicated otherwise.
- Only the latest **stable** package is checked for installation/upgrade and pre-release packages are ignored.

### Non-functional requirements

- Notifications, rule installation and rule upgrade workflows should work:
  - regardless of the package type: with historical rule versions or without;
  - regardless of the package registry availability: i.e., they should also work in air-gapped environments.
- Rule installation and upgrade workflows should work with packages containing up to 15000 historical rule versions. This is the max number of versions of all rules in the package. This limit is enforced by Fleet.
- Kibana should not crash with Out Of Memory exception during package installation.
- For test purposes, it should be possible to use detection rules package versions lower than the latest.

### Functional requirements

- User should be able to install prebuilt rules with and without previewing what exactly they would install (rule properties).
- User should be able to upgrade prebuilt rules with and without previewing what updates they would apply (rule properties of target rule versions).
- If user chooses to preview a prebuilt rule to be installed/upgraded, we currently show this preview in a flyout.
- In the prebuilt rule preview a tab that doesn't have any sections should not be displayed and a section that doesn't have any properties also should not be displayed.

Examples of rule properties we show in the prebuilt rule preview flyout:

## Scenarios

### Package installation

#### **Scenario: Package is installed via Fleet**

**Automation**: 2 e2e tests that install the real package.

```Gherkin
Given the package is not installed
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then the package gets installed in the background from EPR
```

#### **Scenario: Package is installed via bundled Fleet package in Kibana**

**Automation**: 2 integration tests.

```Gherkin
Given the package is not installed
And user is in an air-gapped environment
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then the package gets installed in the background from packages bundled into Kibana
```

#### **Scenario: Large package can be installed on a small Kibana instance**

**Automation**: 1 integration test.

```Gherkin
Given the package is not installed
And the package contains the largest amount of historical rule versions (15000)
And the Kibana instance has a memory heap size of 700 Mb (see note below)
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then the package is installed without Kibana crashing with an Out Of Memory error
```

**Note**: 600 Mb seems to always crash Kibana with an OOM error. 700 Mb runs with no issues in the Flaky test runner with 100 iterations: https://buildkite.com/elastic/kibana-flaky-test-suite-runner/builds/2215.

### Rule installation and upgrade via the Prebuilt rules API

There's a legacy prebuilt rules API and a new one. Both should be tested against two types of the package: with and without historical rule versions.

#### **Scenario: API can install all prebuilt rules**

**Automation**: 8 integration tests with mock rules: 4 examples below \* 2 (we split checking API response and installed rules into two different tests).

```Gherkin
Given the package <package_type> is installed
And the package contains N rules
When user installs all rules via install <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <install_response>
And N rule objects should be created
And each rule object should have correct id and version

Examples:
  | package_type             | api    | install_response         |
  | with historical versions | legacy | installed: N, updated: 0 |
  | w/o historical versions  | legacy | installed: N, updated: 0 |
  | with historical versions | new    | total: N, succeeded: N   |
  | w/o historical versions  | new    | total: N, succeeded: N   |
```

Notes:

- Legacy API:
  - install: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
- New API:
  - install: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/installation/_perform`

#### **Scenario: API can install prebuilt rules that are not yet installed**

**Automation**: 4 integration tests with mock rules.

```Gherkin
Given the package <package_type> is installed
And the package contains N rules
When user installs all rules via install <api>
And deletes one of the installed rules
And gets prebuilt rules status via status <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <status_response>
When user installs all rules via install <api> again
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <install_response>

Examples:
  | package_type             | api    | status_response  | install_response         |
  | with historical versions | legacy | not_installed: 1 | installed: 1, updated: 0 |
  | w/o historical versions  | legacy | not_installed: 1 | installed: 1, updated: 0 |
  | with historical versions | new    | to_install: 1    | total: 1, succeeded: 1   |
  | w/o historical versions  | new    | to_install: 1    | total: 1, succeeded: 1   |
```

Notes:

- Legacy API:
  - install: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
  - status: `GET /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged/_status`
- New API:
  - install: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/installation/_perform`
  - status: `GET /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/status`

#### **Scenario: API can upgrade prebuilt rules that are outdated**

**Automation**: 4 integration tests with mock rules.

```Gherkin
Given the package <package_type> is installed
And the package contains N rules
When user installs all rules via install <api>
And new X+1 version of a rule asset <assets_update>
And user gets prebuilt rules status via status <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <status_response>
When user upgrades all rules via upgrade <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <upgrade_response>

Examples:
  | package_type             | api    | assets_update | status_response | upgrade_response         |
  | with historical versions | legacy | gets added    | not_updated: 1  | installed: 0, updated: 1 |
  | w/o historical versions  | legacy | replaces X    | not_updated: 1  | installed: 0, updated: 1 |
  | with historical versions | new    | gets added    | to_upgrade: 1   | total: 1, succeeded: 1   |
  | w/o historical versions  | new    | replaces X    | to_upgrade: 1   | total: 1, succeeded: 1   |
```

TODO: Check why for the legacy API Dmitrii has added 2 integration tests for `rule package with historical versions` instead of 1:

- `should update outdated prebuilt rules when previous historical versions available`
- `should update outdated prebuilt rules when previous historical versions unavailable`

(NOTE: the second scenario tests that, if a new version of a rule is released, it can upgrade the current instance of that rule even if the historical versions of that rule are no longer in the package)

Notes:

- Legacy API:
  - install: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
  - upgrade: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
  - status: `GET /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged/_status`
- New API:
  - install: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/installation/_perform`
  - upgrade: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/upgrade/_perform`
  - status: `GET /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/status`

#### **Scenario: API does not install or upgrade prebuilt rules if they are up to date**

**Automation**: 4 integration tests with mock rules.

```Gherkin
Given the package <package_type> is installed
And the package contains N rules
When user installs all rules via install <api>
And user gets prebuilt rules status via status <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <status_response>
When user calls install <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <install_response>
When user calls upgrade <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <upgrade_response>

Examples:
  | package_type             | api    | status_response                  | install_response         | upgrade_response         |
  | with historical versions | legacy | not_installed: 0, not_updated: 0 | installed: 0, updated: 0 | installed: 0, updated: 0 |
  | w/o historical versions  | legacy | not_installed: 0, not_updated: 0 | installed: 0, updated: 0 | installed: 0, updated: 0 |
  | with historical versions | new    | to_install: 0, to_upgrade: 0     | total: 0, succeeded: 0   | total: 0, succeeded: 0   |
  | w/o historical versions  | new    | to_install: 0, to_upgrade: 0     | total: 0, succeeded: 0   | total: 0, succeeded: 0   |
```

Notes:

- Legacy API:
  - install: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
  - upgrade: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
  - status: `GET /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged/_status`
- New API:
  - install: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/installation/_perform`
  - upgrade: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/upgrade/_perform`
  - status: `GET /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/status`

### Scenarios for the real package

#### **Scenario: User can install prebuilt rules from scratch, then install new rules and upgrade existing rules from the new package**

**Automation**: 1 integration test with real packages.

```Gherkin
Given there are two package versions: N-1 and N
And the package of N-1 version is installed
When user calls the status endpoint
Then it should return a 200 response with some number of rules to install and 0 rules to upgrade
When user calls the installation/_review endpoint
Then it should return a 200 response matching the response of the status endpoint
When user calls the installation/_perform_ endpoint
Then it should return a 200 response matching the response of the status endpoint
And rules returned in this response should exist as alert saved objects
When user installs the package of N version
Then it should be installed successfully
When user calls the status endpoint
Then it should return a 200 response with some number of new rules to install and some number of rules to upgrade
When user calls the installation/_review endpoint
Then it should return a 200 response matching the response of the status endpoint
When user calls the installation/_perform_ endpoint
Then rules returned in this response should exist as alert saved objects
When user calls the upgrade/_review endpoint
Then it should return a 200 response matching the response of the status endpoint
When user calls the upgrade/_perform_ endpoint
Then rules returned in this response should exist as alert saved objects
```

### Rule installation and upgrade notifications on the Rule Management page

#### **Scenario: User is NOT notified when no prebuilt rules are installed and there are no prebuilt rules assets**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + 1 integration test with mock rules for the /status endpoint.

```Gherkin
Given no prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana

```

### Rule installation workflow: base cases

#### **Scenario: User can install prebuilt rules one by one**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + integration tests with mock rules that would test /status and /installation/\* endpoints in integration.

```Gherkin
Given no prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And there are X prebuilt rules available to install
When user opens the Add Rules page
Then prebuilt rules available for installation should be displayed in the table
When user installs one individual rule without previewing it
Then success message should be displayed after installation
And the installed rule should be removed from the table
When user navigates back to the Rule Management page
Then user should see a CTA to install prebuilt rules
And user should see the number of rules available to install decreased by 1
```

#### **Scenario: User can install multiple prebuilt rules selected on the page**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + integration tests with mock rules that would test /status and /installation/\* endpoints in integration.

```Gherkin
Given no prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And there are X prebuilt rules available to install
When user opens the Add Rules page
Then prebuilt rules available for installation should be displayed in the table
When user selects <Y> rules
Then user should see a CTA to install <Y> number of rules
When user clicks the CTA
Then success message should be displayed after installation
And all the installed rules should be removed from the table
When user navigates back to the Rule Management page
Then user should see a CTA to install prebuilt rules
And user should see the number of rules available to install decreased by <Y> number of installed rules

Examples:
  | Y                               |
  | a few rules on the page, e.g. 2 |
  | all rules on the page, e.g. 12  |
```

#### **Scenario: User can install all available prebuilt rules at once**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + integration tests with mock rules that would test /status and /installation/\* endpoints in integration.

```Gherkin
Given no prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And there are X prebuilt rules available to install
When user opens the Add Rules page
Then prebuilt rules available for installation should be displayed in the table
When user installs all rules
Then success message should be displayed after installation
And all the rules should be removed from the table
And user should see a message indicating that all available rules have been installed
And user should see a CTA that leads to the Rule Management page
When user clicks on the CTA
Then user should be navigated back to Rule Management page
And user should NOT see a CTA to install prebuilt rules
And user should NOT see a number of rules available to install
```

#### **Scenario: Empty screen is shown when all prebuilt rules are installed**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + 1 integration test.

```Gherkin
Given all the available prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
When user opens the Add Rules page
Then user should see a message indicating that all available rules have been installed
And user should see a CTA that leads to the Rule Management page
```

#### **Scenario: User can preview rules available for installation**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test

```Gherkin
Given no prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And there are 2 rules available to install
When user opens the Add Rules page
Then all rules available for installation should be displayed in the table
When user opens the rule preview for the 1st rule
Then the preview should open
When user closes the preview
Then it should disappear
```

#### **Scenario: User can install a rule using the rule preview**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test

```Gherkin
Given no prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And there are 2 rules available to install
When user opens the Add Rules page
Then all rules available for installation should be displayed in the table
When user opens the rule preview for the rule
Then the preview should open
When user installs the rule using a CTA in the rule preview
Then the rule should be installed
And a success message should be displayed after installation
And the rule should be removed from the Add Rules table
When user navigates back to the Rule Management page
Then user should see a CTA to install prebuilt rules
And user should see the number of rules available to install as initial number minus 1
```

#### **Scenario: User can see correct rule information in preview before installing**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test

```Gherkin
Given no prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And there are X prebuilt rules of all types available to install
When user opens the Add Rules page
Then all X rules available for installation should be displayed in the table
When user opens the rule preview for the 1st rule
Then the preview should open
And all properties of the 1st rule should be displayed in the correct tab and section of the preview (see examples of rule properties above)
When user selects the 2nd rule in the table
Then the preview should be updated
And all properties of the 2nd rule should be displayed in the correct tab and section of the preview (see examples of rule properties above)
And user should be able to repeat this for all X rules
```

#### **Scenario: Tabs and sections without content should be hidden in preview before installing**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test

```Gherkin
Given no prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And there is at least 1 rule available to install
And this rule has neither Setup guide nor Investigation guide
When user opens the Add Rules page
Then all rules available for installation should be displayed in the table
When user opens the rule preview for this rule
Then the preview should open
And the Setup Guide section should NOT be displayed in the Overview tab
And the Investigation Guide tab should NOT be displayed
```

### Rule installation workflow: filtering, sorting, pagination

TODO: add scenarios https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/166215

### Rule installation workflow: misc cases

#### **Scenario: User opening the Add Rules page sees a loading skeleton until the package installation is completed**

When user navigates to the Rule Management page via breadcrumbs
Then the Rule Management page should be displayed
```

### Rule upgrade workflow: base cases

#### **Scenario: User can upgrade prebuilt rules one by one**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + integration tests with mock rules that would test /status and /upgrade/\* endpoints in integration.

```Gherkin
Given X prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And for Y of the installed rules there are new versions available
And user is on the Rule Management page
When user opens the Rule Updates table
Then Y rules available for upgrade should be displayed in the table
When user upgrades one individual rule without previewing it
Then success message should be displayed after upgrade
And the upgraded rule should be removed from the table
And user should see the number of rules available to upgrade decreased by 1
```

#### **Scenario: User can upgrade multiple prebuilt rules selected on the page**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + integration tests with mock rules that would test /status and /upgrade/\* endpoints in integration.

```Gherkin

When user clicks the CTA
Then success message should be displayed after upgrade
And all the <Z> upgraded rules should be removed from the table
And user should see the number of rules available to upgrade decreased by <Z> number of upgraded rules

Examples:
  | Z                               |
  | a few rules on the page, e.g. 2 |
  | all rules on the page, e.g. 12  |

### Rule upgrade workflow: filtering, sorting, pagination

TODO: add scenarios https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/166215

### Rule upgrade workflow: simple diff algorithm

#### **Scenario: Rule field doesn't have an update and has no custom value**

**Automation**: 2 integration tests with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithm

```Gherkin
Given at least 1 prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And for this rule there is a new version available
And <field_name> field is not customized by the user (current version == base version)
And <field_name> field is not updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version == base version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the current version as the merged one without a conflict
And <field_name> field should not be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should not be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| field_name | base_version | current_version | target_version |
| name       | "A"          | "A"             | "A"            |
| risk_score | 1            | 1               | 1              |
```

#### **Scenario: Rule field doesn't have an update but has a custom value**

**Automation**: 2 integration tests with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithm

```Gherkin
Given at least 1 prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And for this rule there is a new version available
And <field_name> field is customized by the user (current version != base version)
And <field_name> field is not updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version == base version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the current version as the merged one without a conflict
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| field_name | base_version | current_version | target_version |

```

#### **Scenario: Rule field has an update and a custom value that are the same**

**Automation**: 2 integration tests with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithm

```Gherkin
Given at least 1 prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And for this rule there is a new version available
And <field_name> field is customized by the user (current version != base version)
And <field_name> field is updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version != base version)
And customized <field_name> field is the same as the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version == target version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the current version as the merged one without a conflict
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| field_name | base_version | current_version | target_version |
| name       | "A"          | "B"             | "B"            |
| risk_score | 1            | 2               | 2              |
```

#### **Scenario: Rule field has an update and a custom value that are NOT the same**

**Automation**: 2 integration tests with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithm

```Gherkin
Given at least 1 prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And for this rule there is a new version available
And <field_name> field is customized by the user (current version != base version)
And <field_name> field is updated by Elastic in this upgrade (target version != base version)
And customized <field_name> field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the current version as the merged one with a conflict
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| field_name | base_version | current_version | target_version |
| name       | "A"          | "B"             | "C"            |
| risk_score | 1            | 2               | 3              |
```

#### **Scenario: Rule field has an update and a custom value that are NOT the same and the rule base version doesn't exist**

**Automation**: 2 integration tests with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithm

```Gherkin
Given at least 1 prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And for this rule there is a new version available
And the base version of the rule cannot be determined
And customized <field_name> field is different than the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version != target version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the target version as the merged one with a conflict
And <field_name> field should be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should be shown in the upgrade preview UI

Examples:
| field_name | base_version | current_version | target_version |
| name       | N/A          | "B"             | "C"            |
| risk_score | N/A          | 2               | 3              |
```

#### **Scenario: Rule field has an update and a custom value that are the same and the rule base version doesn't exist**

**Automation**: 2 integration tests with mock rules + a set of unit tests for the algorithm

```Gherkin
Given at least 1 prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And for this rule there is a new version available
And the base version of the rule cannot be determined
And customized <field_name> field is the same as the Elastic update in this upgrade (current version == target version)
Then for <field_name> field the diff algorithm should output the current version as the merged one without a conflict
And <field_name> field should not be returned from the `upgrade/_review` API endpoint
And <field_name> field should not be shown in the upgrade preview UI


Examples:
| field_name | base_version | current_version | target_version |
| name       | N/A          | "A"             | "A"            |
| risk_score | N/A          | 1               | 1              |
```

### Rule upgrade workflow: viewing rule changes in JSON diff view

#### **Scenario: User can see changes in a side-by-side JSON diff view**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test

```Gherkin
Given X prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And for Y of these rules new versions are available
When user opens the Rule Updates table and selects a rule
Then the upgrade preview should open
And rule changes should be displayed in a two-column JSON diff view
And correct rule version numbers should be displayed in their respective columns
When the user selects another rule without closing the preview
Then the preview should display the changes for the newly selected rule
```

#### **Scenario: User can see precisely how property values would change after upgrade**

**Automation**: 1 UI integration test

```Gherkin
Given a rule preview with rule changes is open
Then each line of <column> that was <change_type> should have <bg_color> background
And marked with <line_badge> badge
And each changed word in <column> should be highlighted with <accent_color>

Examples:
| change_type | column         | bg_color         | accent_color         | line_badge |
| updated     | Current rule   | removed_bg_color | removed_accent_color | -          |
| updated     | Elastic update | added_bg_color   | added_accent_color   | +          |
| removed     | Current rule   | removed_bg_color | none                 | -          |
| removed     | Elastic update | none             | none                 | none       |
| added       | Current rule   | none             | none                 | none       |
| added       | Elastic update | added_bg_color   | none                 | +          |
```

#### **Scenario: Rule actions and exception lists should not be shown as modified**

**Automation**: 1 UI integration test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And the currently installed version of this rule doesn't have any actions or an exception list
And a user has set up actions and an exception list for this rule
And this rule has an update available
And the update doesn't define any actions or an exception list
When a user opens the upgrade preview for this rule
Then the preview should open
And the JSON diff shouldn't show any modifications to rule's actions or exception list
```

#### **Scenario: Dynamic properties should not be included in preview**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And this rule is disabled by default
And a user has enabled this rule
And this rule executed at least once
And this rule has an update available
When user opens the upgrade preview
Then the preview should open
And the JSON diff shouldn't show any <property> properties on both sides

Examples:
| property          |
| execution_summary |
| enabled           |
```

#### **Scenario: Technical properties should not be included in preview**

**Automation**: 1 UI integration test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And this rule has an update available
When a user opens the upgrade preview
Then the preview should open
And the JSON diff shouldn't show any <technical_property> properties on both sides

Examples:
| technical_property |
| revision           |
| updated_at         |
| updated_by         |
| created_at         |
| created_by         |
```

#### **Scenario: Properties with semantically equal values should not be shown as modified**

**Automation**: 1 UI integration test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And this rule has an update available
And the update has properties with different, but semantically equal values
When a user opens the upgrade preview
Then the preview should open
And the JSON diff shouldn't show any changes to properties with semantically equal values

Duration examples:
| 1h       |
| 60m      |
| 3600s    |

Empty value examples:
| no value  |
| ''        |
| []        |
| undefined |
| null      |
```

#### **Scenario: Unchanged sections of a rule should be hidden by default**

**Automation**: 1 UI integration test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And this rule has an update available
When a user opens the upgrade preview
Then the preview should open
And only the sections of the diff that have changes should be visible
And unchanged sections should be hidden behind a button with a number of unchanged lines
When a user clicks on the hidden section button
Then the section should expand and show the unchanged properties
```

#### **Scenario: Properties should be sorted alphabetically**

**Automation**: 1 UI integration test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And this rule has an update available
When a user opens the upgrade preview
Then the preview should open
And visible properties should be sorted alphabetically
When a user expands all hidden sections
Then all properties of the rule should be sorted alphabetically
```

### Rule upgrade workflow: viewing rule changes in per-field diff view

#### **Scenario: User can see changes in a side-by-side per-field diff view**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test

```Gherkin
Given X prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And for Y of these rules new versions are available
When user opens the Rule Updates table and selects a rule
Then the per-field upgrade preview should open
And rule changes should be displayed in a two-column diff view with each field in its own accordion component
And all field diff accordions should be open by default
And correct rule version numbers should be displayed in their respective columns
When the user selects another rule without closing the preview
Then the preview should display the changes for the newly selected rule
```

#### **Scenario: User can see changes when updated rule is a different rule type**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And this rule has an update available that changes the rule type
When user opens the upgrade preview
Then the rule type changes should be displayed in grouped field diffs with corresponding query fields
# When tooltip enhancement is added, this step needs to be added to the corresponding test scenario
And a tooltip is displayed with information about changing rule types
```

#### **Scenario: Field groupings should be rendered together in the same accordion panel**

**Automation**: 1 UI integration test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And this rule contains one or more <field> values
When user opens the upgrade preview
The <field> diff accordion panel should display its grouped rule properties
And each property should have its name displayed inside the panel above its value

Examples:
| field              |
| data_source        |
| kql_query          |
| eql_query          |
| esql_query         |
| threat_query       |
| rule_schedule      |
| rule_name_override |
| timestamp_override |
| timeline_template  |
| building_block     |
| threshold          |
```

#### **Scenario: Undefined values are displayed with empty diffs**

**Automation**: 1 UI integration test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And this rule has field in the <version_one> version that didn't exist in the <version_two> version
When a user opens the upgrade preview
Then the preview should open
And the old/new field should render an empty panel

Examples:
| version_one | version_two |
| target      | current     |
| current     | target      |
```

#### **Scenario: Field diff components have the same grouping and order as in rule details overview**

**Automation**: 1 UI integration test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And this rule has multiple fields that are different between the current and target version
When a user opens the upgrade preview
Then the multiple field diff accordions should be sorted in the same order as on the rule details overview tab
And the field diff accordions should be grouped inside its corresponding <section> accordion
And any <section> accordion that doesn't have fields inside it shouldn't be displayed

Examples:
| section     |
| About       |
| Definition  |
| Schedule    |
| Setup Guide |
```

### Rule upgrade workflow: preserving rule bound data

#### **Scenario: Rule bound data is preserved after upgrading a rule to a newer version with the same rule type**

**Automation**: 1 unit test per case, 1 integration test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And this rule has an update available
And the update has the same rule type
When a user upgrades the rule
Then the rule bound data should be preserved
```

Examples: generated alerts, exception lists (rule exception list, shared exception list, endpoint exception list), timeline reference, actions, enabled state, execution results and execution events.

#### **Scenario: Rule bound data is preserved after upgrading a rule to a newer version with a different rule type**

**Automation**: 1 unit test per case, 1 integration test

```Gherkin
Given a prebuilt rule is installed in Kibana
And this rule has an update available
And the update has a different rule type
When a user upgrades the rule
Then the rule bound data should be preserved
```

Examples: generated alerts, exception lists (rule exception list, shared exception list, endpoint exception list), timeline reference, actions, enabled state, execution results and execution events.

### Rule upgrade workflow: misc cases

#### **Scenario: User doesn't see the Rule Updates tab until the package installation is completed**

**Automation**: unit tests.

```Gherkin
Given prebuilt rules package is not installed
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then user should NOT see the Rule Updates tab until the package installation is completed and there are rules available for upgrade
```

### Error handling

#### **Scenario: Error is handled when any operation on prebuilt rules fails**

**Automation**: e2e test with mock rules

```Gherkin
When user is <operation> prebuilt rules
And this operation fails
Then user should see an error message

Examples:
  | operation             |
  | installing all        |
  | installing selected   |
  | installing individual |
  | upgrading all         |
  | upgrading selected    |
  | upgrading individual  |
```

### Authorization / RBAC

#### **Scenario: User with read privileges on Security Solution cannot install prebuilt rules**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + 3 integration tests with mock rules for the status and installation endpoints.

```Gherkin
Given user with "Security: read" privileges on Security Solution
And no prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And there are prebuilt rules available to install
When user opens the Add Rules page
Then user should see prebuilt rules available to install
But user should not be able to install them
```

#### **Scenario: User with read privileges on Security Solution cannot upgrade prebuilt rules**

**Automation**: 1 e2e test with mock rules + 3 integration tests with mock rules for the status and upgrade endpoints.

```Gherkin
Given user with "Security: read" privileges on Security Solution
And X prebuilt rules are installed in Kibana
And for Y of the installed rules there are new versions available
When user opens the Rule Management page
And user opens the Rule Updates table
Then user should see prebuilt rules available to upgrade
But user should not be able to upgrade them
```

### Kibana upgrade

#### **Scenario: User can use prebuilt rules after upgrading Kibana from version A to B**

**Automation**: not automated, manual testing required.

```Gherkin
Given user is upgrading Kibana from version <A> to version <B>
And the <A> instance contains already installed prebuilt rules
When the upgrade is complete
Then user should be able to install new prebuilt rules
And delete installed prebuilt rules
And upgrade installed prebuilt rules that have newer versions in <B>

Examples:
  | A      | B     |
  | 8.7    | 8.9.0 |
  | 7.17.x | 8.9.0 |
```
