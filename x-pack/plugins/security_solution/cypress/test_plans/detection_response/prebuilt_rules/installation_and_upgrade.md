# Installation and Upgrade of Prebuilt Rules

This is a test plan for the workflows of installing and upgrading prebuilt rules.

Status: `in progress`. The current test plan matches `Milestone 2` of the [Rule Immutability/Customization](https://github.com/elastic/security-team/issues/1974) epic. It does not cover any past functionality that was removed or functionality to be implemented in the future. The plan is about to change in the future Milestones.

## Useful information

### Tickets

- [Rule Immutability/Customization](https://github.com/elastic/security-team/issues/1974) epic
- [Ensure full test coverage for existing workflows of installing and upgrading prebuilt rules](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/148176)
- [Write test plan and add test coverage for the new workflows of installing and upgrading prebuilt rules](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/148192)
- [Document the new UI for installing and upgrading prebuilt detection rules](https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/issues/3496)

### Terminology

- **EPR**: [Elastic Package Registry](https://github.com/elastic/package-registry), service that hosts our **Package**.

- **Package**: `security_detection_engine` Fleet package that we use to distribute prebuilt detection rules in the form of `security-rule` assets (saved objects).

- **Real package**: actual latest stable package distributed and pulled from EPR via Fleet.

- **Mock rules**: `security-rule` assets that are indexed into the `.kibana_security_solution` index directly in the test setup, either by using the ES client _in integration tests_ or by an API request _in Cypress tests_.

- **Air-gapped environment**: an environment where Kibana doesn't have access to the internet. In general, EPR is not available in such environments, except the cases when the user runs a custom EPR inside the environment.

- **CTA**: "call to action", usually a button, a link, or a callout message with a button, etc, that invites the user to do some action.
  - CTA to install prebuilt rules - at this moment, it's a link button with a counter (implemented) and a callout with a link button (not yet implemented) on the Rule Management page.
  - CTA to upgrade prebuilt rules - at this moment, it's a tab with a counter (implemented) and a callout with a link button (not yet implemented) on the Rule Management page.

### Assumptions

- Below scenarios only apply to prebuilt detection rules.
- Most of our users are on the 7.17.x version, thatâ€™s why the 8.x version is specified on scenarios, because this test plan is considering a minimum version of 8.x.
- Users should be able to install and upgrade prebuilt rules on the `Basic` license and higher.
- EPR is available for fetching the package unless explicitly indicated otherwise.
- Only the latest **stable** package is checked for installation/upgrade and pre-release packages are ignored.

### Non-functional requirements

- Notifications, rule installation and rule upgrade workflows should work:
  - regardless of the package type: with historical rule versions or without;
  - regardless of the package registry availability: i.e., they should also work in air-gapped environments.
- Rule installation and upgrade workflows should work with packages containing up to 15000 historical rule versions. This is the max number of versions of all rules in the package. This limit is enforced by Fleet.
- Kibana should not crash with Out Of Memory exception during package installation.
- For test purposes, it should be possible to use detection rules package versions lower than the latest.

## Scenarios

### Package installation

#### **Scenario: Package is installed via Fleet**

**Coverage**: 0 tests - covered by other scenarios. This scenario will be covered by the **Users install the latest prebuilt rules** scenario, which will include 1 e2e test which installs the rules from the real package.

TODO: Where are scenarios for the real package?

```Gherkin
Given the package is not installed
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then the package gets installed in the background from EPR
```

#### **Scenario: Package is installed via bundled Fleet package in Kibana**

**Coverage**: 1 integration test.

```Gherkin
Given the package is not installed
And user is in an air-gapped environment
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then the package gets installed in the background from packages bundled into Kibana
```

#### **Scenario: Large package can be installed on a small Kibana instance**

**Coverage**: 1 integration test.

```Gherkin
Given the package is not installed
And the package contains the largest amount of historical rule versions (15000)
And the Kibana instance has a memory heap size of X Mb (see note below)
When user opens the Rule Management page
Then the package is installed without Kibana crashing with an Out Of Memory error
```

TODO: Update the `heap size of X Mb` to a concrete value and update the note below.

**Note**: The amount of memory is undefined as of now because, during implementation, we will try to find a memory heap threshold below which Kibana starts to crash constantly when you install the package with 15k rules. The plan is to then increase it to the point where it stops crashing, and use it as our value for this test.

### Rule installation and upgrade via the Prebuilt rules API

There's a legacy prebuilt rules API and a new one. Both should be tested against two types of the package: with and without historical rule versions.

#### **Scenario: API can install all prebuilt rules**

**Coverage**: 8 integration tests with mock rules: 4 examples below * 2 (we split checking API response and installed rules into two different tests).

```Gherkin
Given the package <package_type> is installed
And the package contains N rules
When user installs all rules via install <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <install_response>
And N rule objects should be created
And each rule object should have correct id and version

Examples:
  | package_type             | api    | install_response         |
  | with historical versions | legacy | installed: N, updated: 0 |
  | w/o historical versions  | legacy | installed: N, updated: 0 |
  | with historical versions | new    | total: N, succeeded: N   |
  | w/o historical versions  | new    | total: N, succeeded: N   |
```

Notes:

- Legacy API:
  - install: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
- New API:
  - install: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/installation/_perform`

#### **Scenario: API can install prebuilt rules that are not yet installed**

**Coverage**: 4 integration tests with mock rules.

```Gherkin
Given the package <package_type> is installed
And the package contains N rules
When user installs all rules via install <api>
And deletes one of the installed rules
And gets prebuilt rules status via status <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <status_response>
When user installs all rules via install <api> again
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <install_response>

Examples:
  | package_type             | api    | status_response  | install_response         |
  | with historical versions | legacy | not_installed: 1 | installed: 1, updated: 0 |
  | w/o historical versions  | legacy | not_installed: 1 | installed: 1, updated: 0 |
  | with historical versions | new    | to_install: 1    | total: 1, succeeded: 1   |
  | w/o historical versions  | new    | to_install: 1    | total: 1, succeeded: 1   |
```

Notes:

- Legacy API:
  - install: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
  - status: `GET /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged/_status`
- New API:
  - install: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/installation/_perform`
  - status: `GET /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/status`

#### **Scenario: API can upgrade prebuilt rules that are outdated**

**Coverage**: 4 integration tests with mock rules.

```Gherkin
Given the package <package_type> is installed
And the package contains N rules
When user installs all rules via install <api>
And new X+1 version of a rule asset <assets_update>
And user gets prebuilt rules status via status <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <status_response>
When user upgrades all rules via upgrade <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <upgrade_response>

Examples:
  | package_type             | api    | assets_update | status_response | upgrade_response         |
  | with historical versions | legacy | gets added    | not_updated: 1  | installed: 0, updated: 1 |
  | w/o historical versions  | legacy | replaces X    | not_updated: 1  | installed: 0, updated: 1 |
  | with historical versions | new    | gets added    | to_upgrade: 1   | total: 1, succeeded: 1   |
  | w/o historical versions  | new    | replaces X    | to_upgrade: 1   | total: 1, succeeded: 1   |
```

TODO: Check why for the legacy API Dmitrii has added 2 integration tests for `rule package with historical versions` instead of 1:

- `should update outdated prebuilt rules when previous historical versions available`
- `should update outdated prebuilt rules when previous historical versions unavailable`

Notes:

- Legacy API:
  - install: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
  - upgrade: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
  - status: `GET /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged/_status`
- New API:
  - install: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/installation/_perform`
  - upgrade: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/upgrade/_perform`
  - status: `GET /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/status`

#### **Scenario: API does not install or upgrade prebuilt rules if they are up to date**

**Coverage**: 4 integration tests with mock rules.

```Gherkin
Given the package <package_type> is installed
And the package contains N rules
When user installs all rules via install <api>
And user gets prebuilt rules status via status <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <status_response>
When user calls install <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <install_response>
When user calls upgrade <api>
Then the endpoint should return 200 with <upgrade_response>

Examples:
  | package_type             | api    | status_response                  | install_response         | upgrade_response         |
  | with historical versions | legacy | not_installed: 0, not_updated: 0 | installed: 0, updated: 0 | installed: 0, updated: 0 |
  | w/o historical versions  | legacy | not_installed: 0, not_updated: 0 | installed: 0, updated: 0 | installed: 0, updated: 0 |
  | with historical versions | new    | to_install: 0, to_upgrade: 0     | total: 0, succeeded: 0   | total: 0, succeeded: 0   |
  | w/o historical versions  | new    | to_install: 0, to_upgrade: 0     | total: 0, succeeded: 0   | total: 0, succeeded: 0   |
```

Notes:

- Legacy API:
  - install: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
  - upgrade: `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged`
  - status: `GET /api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged/_status`
- New API:
  - install: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/installation/_perform`
  - upgrade: `POST /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/upgrade/_perform`
  - status: `GET /internal/detection_engine/prebuilt_rules/status`
