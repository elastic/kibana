# Prebuilt Rules Install and Update workflows

## Test Plan for 2nd Milestone of Customizing prebuilt detection rules

### Useful information

Part of epic: [https://github.com/elastic/security-team/issues/1974](https://github.com/elastic/security-team/issues/1974)

**Assumptions**
- The current test plan is only for Milestone 2 of the Rule Immutability/Customization feature to be released in 8.9. It does not pretend to cover any scenario for past or future milestones. Scenarios and flows are sensitive to change in future Milestones.
- Below scenarios only apply to prebuilt rules.
- Most of our users are on the 7.17.x version, that’s why the 8.x version is specified on scenarios, because this TestPlan is considering a minimum version of 8.x.
- The rule Customization feature should be available to users on the Basic license and higher.
