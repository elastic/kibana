/**
 * The format of defining features supports OR and AND mechanism. To specify features in an OR fashion
 * they can be defined in a single level array like: [requiredFeature1, requiredFeature2]. If either of these features
 * is satisfied the link would be included. To require that the features be AND'd together a second level array
 * can be specified: [feature1, [feature2, feature3]] this would result in feature1 || (feature2 && feature3). To specify
 * features that all must be and'd together an example would be: [[feature1, feature2]], this would result in the boolean
 * operation feature1 && feature2.
 *
 * The final format is to specify a single feature, this would be like: features: feature1, which is the same as
 * features: [feature1]
