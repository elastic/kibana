/**
 * The scale by which world values are scaled when rendered.
 *
 * When the camera position (translation) is changed programatically, it may be animated.
 * The duration of the animation is generally fixed for a given type of interaction. This way
 * the user won't have to wait for a variable amount of time to complete their interaction.
 *
 * Since the duration is fixed and the amount that the camera position changes is variable,
 * the speed at which the camera changes is also variable. If the distance the camera will move
 * is very far, the camera will move very fast.
 *
 * When the camera moves fast, elements will move across the screen quickly. These
 * quick moving elements can be distracting to the user. They may also hinder the quality of
 * animation.
 *
 * The speed at which objects move across the screen is dependent on the speed of the camera
 * as well as the scale. If the scale is high, the camera is zoomed in, and so objects move
 * across the screen faster at a given camera speed. Think of looking into a telephoto lense
 * and moving around only a few degrees: many things might pass through your sight.
 *
 * If the scale is low, the camera is zoomed out, objects look further away, and so they move
 * across the screen slower at a given camera speed. Therefore we can control the speed at
 * which objects move across the screen without changing the camera speed. We do this by changing scale.
 *
 * Changing the scale abruptly isn't acceptable because it would be visually jarring. Also, the
 * change in scale should be temporary, and the original scale should be resumed after the animation.
 *
 * In order to change the scale to lower value, and then back, without being jarring to the user,
 * we calculate a temporary target scale and animate to it.
