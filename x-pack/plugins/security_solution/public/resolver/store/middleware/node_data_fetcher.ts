           *
           * 1. The data no longer exists in Elasticsearch. This is an unlikely scenario because for us to be requesting
           *  a node ID it means that when we retrieved the initial resolver graph we had at least 1 event so that we could
           *  draw a node using that event on the graph. A user could delete the node's data between the time when we
           *  requested the original graph and now.
           *
           *  In this situation we'll want to record that there is no node data for that specific node but still mark the
           *  status as Received.
           *
           * 2. The request limit for the /events API was received. Currently we pass in 5000 as the limit. If we receive
           *  5000 events back than it is possible that we won't receive a single event for one of the node IDs we requested.
           *  In this scenario we'll want to mark the node in such a way that on a future action we'll try requesting
           *  the data for that particular node. We'll have a higher likelihood of receiving data on subsequent requests
           *  because the number of node IDs that we request will go done as we receive their data back.
           *
           *  In this scenario we'll remove the entry in the node data map so that on a subsequent middleware call
           *  if that node is still in view we'll request its node data.
