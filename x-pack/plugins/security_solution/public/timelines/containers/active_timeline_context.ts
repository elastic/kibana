 * Future Engineer
 * This class is just there to manage temporarily the reload of the active timeline when switching tabs
 * because of the bootstrap of the security solution app, we will always trigger the query
 * to avoid it we will cache its request and response so we can go back where the user was before switching tabs
 *
 * !!! Important !!! this is just there until, we will have a better way to bootstrap the app
 * I did not want to put in the store because I was feeling it will feel less temporarily and I did not want other engineer using it
