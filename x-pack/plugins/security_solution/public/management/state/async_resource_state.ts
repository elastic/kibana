 * this file contains set of types to represent state of asynchronous resource.
 * Resource is defined as a reference to potential data that is loaded/updated
 * using asynchronous communication with data source (for example through REST API call).
 * Asynchronous update implies that next to just having data:
 *  - there is moment in time when data is not loaded/initialised and not in process of loading/updating
 *  - process performing data update can take considerable time which needs to be communicated to user
 *  - update can fail due to multiple reasons and also needs to be communicated to the user
