- This document launched a child process to write and execute a malicious script file named "AppPool.vbs".
- The "AppPool.vbs" script then spawned PowerShell to execute an obfuscated script payload from "AppPool.ps1".
- On {{ host.name 5149b291-72d0-4373-93ec-c117477932fe }}, a similar attack involving a malicious Office document and the creation of "AppPool.vbs" was detected and prevented.

This appears to be a malware attack delivered via spearphishing, likely exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to gain initial access and then using PowerShell for execution and obfuscation. The attacker employed defense evasion techniques like script obfuscation and system binary proxies like "wscript.exe" and "mshta.exe". Mitigations should focus on patching Office vulnerabilities, restricting script execution, and enhancing email security controls.
