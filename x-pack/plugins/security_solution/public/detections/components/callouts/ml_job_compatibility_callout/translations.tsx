            was created. New ML jobs, prefixed with V2, have been updated to
            operate on now-current ECS fields. If you are using multiple
            versions of beats and agents, you need to create new machine
            learning rules that specify the new ML (V2) jobs, and enable them
            to run alongside your existing machine learning rules, in order
            to ensure continued rule coverage."
