 * Callout component that lets the user know that an administrator is needed for performing
 * and auto-update of signals or not. For this component to render the user must:
 * - Have the permissions to be able to read "signalIndexMappingOutdated" and that condition is "true"
 * - Have the permissions to be able to read "hasIndexManage" and that condition is "false"
 *
 * Some users do not have sufficient privileges to be able to determine if "signalIndexMappingOutdated"
 * is outdated or not. Same could apply to "hasIndexManage". When users do not have enough permissions
 * to determine if "signalIndexMappingOutdated" is true or false, the permissions system returns a "null"
 * instead.
 *
 * If the user has the permissions to see that signalIndexMappingOutdated is true and that
 * hasIndexManage is also true, then the user should be performing the update on the page which is
 * why we do not show it for that condition.
