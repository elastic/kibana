    // has certain performance issues and is also limited by the maximum result window setting on .kibana index
    // (10,000 by default) we always fetch the first page of the results sorted by the `updated_at` field. This way we
    // can prioritize "old" objects that have a higher chance to have been encrypted with the old encryption keys, since
    // all newly created or updated objects are always encrypted with the current primary key. Re-encryption of the
    // "old" objects with the primary key implicitly bumps up their `updated_at` field so that these objects won't be
    // included into the first page of the results during next iteration. Additionally we track IDs of all processed
    // objects so that eventually we can detect that first page consists of only objects encrypted with the current
    // primary key and stop iterating.
    //
    // LIMITATION: if we have a lot of "old" objects encrypted with the _unknown_ encryption key it may either
    // significantly slow down rotation or prevent it from happening completely since such objects will be included into
    // every batch we fetch and if their number is equal to or greater than `batchSize` we won't be able to process any
    // object. Another and more complex case when we can be hit by this limitation is when users have multiple Kibana
    // instances configured with different primary encryption keys, these time even "new" objects may require rotation,
    // but they may be included into 2+ page of the results. We can potentially detect such cases and issue a warning,
    // but it's not an easy task: if we detect a case when none of the objects from the very first batch cannot be
    // decrypted with the decryption only keys we'll need to check how many of them can be decrypted at all using all
    // available keys including the current primary one.
    //
    // Also theoretically if `batchSize` is less than `index.max_result_window` we could try to rely on the paging
    // functionality and switch to the second page, but the issue here is that objects can be deleted in the meantime
    // so that unprocessed objects may get into the first page and we'll miss them. We can of course oscillate between
    // the first and the second pages or do multiple rotation passes, but it'd complicate code significantly.
