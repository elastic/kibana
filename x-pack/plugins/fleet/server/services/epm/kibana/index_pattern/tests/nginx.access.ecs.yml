  any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements
  on a host.
  Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields
  shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer
  where the event happened or the measurement was taken.'
  footnote: 'Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat.
  For APM, it is the agent running in the app/service. The agent information does
  not change if data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing
  systems such as Logstash or APM Server.'
