    Connectors are used to interface with external systems. You must create a
    connector before you can use it in your cases. Refer to the add connectors
    API. If you set a default connector, it is automatically selected when you
    create cases in Kibana. If you use the create case API, however, you must
    still specify all of the connector details.
