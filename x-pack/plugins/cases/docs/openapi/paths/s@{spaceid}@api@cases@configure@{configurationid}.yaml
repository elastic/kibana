  operationId: updateCaseConfiguration
  description: >
    You must have `all` privileges for the **Cases** feature in the
    **Management**, **Observability**, or **Security** section of the Kibana
    feature privileges, depending on the owner of the case configuration.
    Connectors are used to interface with external systems. You must create a
    connector before you can use it in your cases. Refer to the add connectors API.
