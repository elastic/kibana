    You must have read privileges for the **Cases** feature in the **Management**,
    **Observability**, or **Security** section of the Kibana feature privileges,
    depending on the owner of the cases.
    The API returns information about the users as they existed at the time of
    the case creation, including their name, full name, and email address. If
    any of those details change thereafter or if a user is deleted, the
    information returned by this API is unchanged.
