title: Alert indices
description: >
  The alert indices. It is required only when `type` is `alert`.  If you are
  adding multiple alerts to a case, use an array of strings; the position of
  each index name in the array must match the position of the corresponding
  alert identifier in the `alertId` array. This functionality is in technical
  preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will apply
  best effort to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not
  subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
