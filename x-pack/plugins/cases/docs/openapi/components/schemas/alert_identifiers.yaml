title: Alert identifiers
description: >
  The alert identifier. It is required only when `type` is `alert`. If it is
  an array, `index` must also be an array with the same length or number of
  elements. This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or
  removed in a future release. Elastic will apply best effort to fix any issues,
  but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of
  official GA features.
