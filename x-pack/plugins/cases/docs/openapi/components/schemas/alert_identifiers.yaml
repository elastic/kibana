title: Alert identifiers
description: >
  The alert identifiers. It is required only when `type` is `alert`. You can use
  an array of strings to add multiple alerts to a case, provided that they all
  relate to the same rule; `index` must also be an array with the same length or number of elements. Adding multiple alerts in this manner is recommended
  rather than calling the API multiple times. This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will apply
  best effort to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not
  subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
