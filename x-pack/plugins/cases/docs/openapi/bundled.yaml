        Sets external connection details, such as the closure type and default
        connector for cases. You must have all privileges for the **Cases**
        feature in the **Management**, **Observability**, or **Security**
        section of the Kibana feature privileges, depending on the owner of the
        case configuration. Connectors are used to interface with external
        systems. You must create a connector before you can use it in your
        cases. Refer to the add connectors API. If you set a default connector,
        it is automatically selected when you create cases in Kibana. If you use
        the create case API, however, you must still specify all of the
        connector details.

        Sets external connection details, such as the closure type and default
        connector for cases. You must have all privileges for the **Cases**
        feature in the **Management**, **Observability**, or **Security**
        section of the Kibana feature privileges, depending on the owner of the
        case configuration. Connectors are used to interface with external
        systems. You must create a connector before you can use it in your
        cases. Refer to the add connectors API. If you set a default connector,
        it is automatically selected when you create cases in Kibana. If you use
        the create case API, however, you must still specify all of the
        connector details.
