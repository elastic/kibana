// Defining these sections is only necessary for options where a reset/deletion of that part of the
// configuration is supported by the API. For example, this isn't suitable to use with `dest` since
// this overall part of the configuration is not optional. However, `retention_policy` is optional,
// so we need to support to recognize this based on the form state and be able to reset it by
// creating a request body containing `{ retention_policy: null }`.
