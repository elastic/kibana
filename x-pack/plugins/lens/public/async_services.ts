/**
 * This file re-exports all parts of visualizations and datasources which can be loaded lazily
 * (to reduce page load bundle size) when Lens is actually accessed via editor or embeddable.
 *
 * It's also possible for each visualization and datasource to resolve this locally, but this causes
 * a burst of bundles being loaded on Lens startup at once (and in some scenarios cascading bundle loads).
 * This file causes all of them to be served in a single request.
