The matching key in the input dataset can be defined using 'ON <field-name>'. If itâ€™s not specified, the match will be performed on a field with the same name as the match field defined in the enrich policy. You can specify which attributes to be added to the result using 'WITH <field1>, <field2>...' syntax. Attributes can also be renamed using 'WITH new_name=<field1>'.

An ES|QL query consists of a series of commands, separated by pipes. Each query starts with a source command that produces a table, typically with data from Elasticsearch. This can be followed by one or more processing commands that modify the input table by adding, removing, or changing rows and columns. Processing commands can be chained together, with each command working on the output table of the previous command. The result of a query is the table produced by the final processing command. ES|QL can be used via the _esql endpoint, and results are returned as JSON by default. It can also be used in Kibana's Discover and Lens features for data exploration and visualization. Currently, ES|QL supports field types such as alias, boolean, date, ip, keyword family, double/float/half_float, long int/short/byte, and version.","user":{"name":"elastic","id":"u_mGBROF_q5bmFCATbLXAcCwKa0k8JvONAwSruelyKA5E_0"},"ml":{"model_id":".elser_model_1"}}]}`,
