KEEP

Syntax
KEEP columns
Parameters
columns::
A comma-separated list of columns to keep. Supports wildcards.DescriptionThe KEEP processing command enables you to specify what columns are returned
and the order in which they are returned.ExamplesThe columns are returned in the specified order:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP emp_no, first_name, last_name, height
```

Rather than specify each column by name, you can use wildcards to return all
columns with a name that matches a pattern:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*
```

The asterisk wildcard (*) by itself translates to all columns that do not
match the other arguments. This query will first return all columns with a name
that starts with h, followed by all other columns:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*, *
```
