AUTO_BUCKET

Creates human-friendly buckets and returns a datetime value for each row that
corresponds to the resulting bucket the row falls into. Combine AUTO_BUCKET
with STATS ... BY to create a date histogram.You provide a target number of buckets, a start date, and an end date, and it
picks an appropriate bucket size to generate the target number of buckets or
fewer. For example, this asks for at most 20 buckets over a whole year, which
picks monthly buckets:
ROW date=TO_DATETIME("1985-07-09T00:00:00.000Z")
| EVAL bucket=AUTO_BUCKET(date, 20, "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z")
The goal isn’t to provide exactly the target number of buckets, it’s to pick a
range that people are comfortable with that provides at most the target number of
buckets.If you ask for more buckets then AUTO_BUCKET can pick a smaller range. For example,
asking for at most 100 buckets in a year will get you week long buckets:
ROW date=TO_DATETIME("1985-07-09T00:00:00.000Z")
| EVAL bucket=AUTO_BUCKET(date, 100, "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z")
AUTO_BUCKET does not filter any rows. It only uses the provided time range to
pick a good bucket size. For rows with a date outside of the range, it returns a
datetime that corresponds to a bucket outside the range. Combine AUTO_BUCKET
with WHERE to filter rows.A more complete example might look like:
FROM employees
| WHERE hire_date >= "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z" AND hire_date < "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z"
| EVAL bucket = AUTO_BUCKET(hire_date, 20, "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z")
| STATS AVG(salary) BY bucket
| SORT bucket
AUTO_BUCKET does not create buckets that don’t match any documents. That’s
why the example above is missing 1985-03-01 and other dates.
