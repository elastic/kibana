POW


Returns the value of a base (first argument) raised to the power of an exponent (second argument).
Both arguments must be numeric. The output is always a double.  Note that it is still possible to overflow
a double result here; in that case, null will be returned.
```esql
ROW base = 2.0, exponent = 2
| EVAL result = POW(base, exponent)
```

Fractional exponentseditThe exponent can be a fraction, which is similar to performing a root.
For example, the exponent of 0.5 will give the square root of the base:
```esql
ROW base = 4, exponent = 0.5
| EVAL s = POW(base, exponent)
```
