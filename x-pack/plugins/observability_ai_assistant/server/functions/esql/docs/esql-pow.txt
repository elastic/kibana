POW
[]
Returns the value of a base (first argument) raised to the power of an
exponent (second argument). Both arguments must be numeric.
    ROW base = 2.0, exponent = 2
    | EVAL result = POW(base, exponent)
  base:double   exponent:integer   result:double
  ------------- ------------------ ---------------
  2.0           2                  4.0
Type rules
The type of the returned value is determined by the types of the base
and exponent. The following rules are applied to determine the result
type:
-   If either of the base or exponent are of a floating point type, the
    result will be a double
-   Otherwise, if either the base or the exponent are 64-bit (long or
    unsigned long), the result will be a long
-   Otherwise, the result will be a 32-bit integer (this covers all
    other numeric types, including int, short and byte)
For example, using simple integers as arguments will lead to an integer
result:
    ROW base = 2, exponent = 2
    | EVAL s = POW(base, exponent)
  base:integer   exponent:integer   s:integer
  -------------- ------------------ -----------
  2              2                  4
The actual power function is performed using double precision values for
all cases. This means that for very large non-floating point values
there is a small chance that the operation can lead to slightly
different answers than expected. However, a more likely outcome of very
large non-floating point values is numerical overflow.
Arithmetic errors
Arithmetic errors and numeric overflow do not result in an error.
Instead, the result will be null and a warning for the
ArithmeticException added. For example:
    ROW x = POW(9223372036854775808, 2)
  warning:Line 1:9: evaluation of [POW(9223372036854775808, 2)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  warning:java.lang.ArithmeticException: long overflow
  x:long
  --------
  null
If it is desired to protect against numerical overruns, use to_double on
either of the arguments:
    ROW x = POW(9223372036854775808, TO_DOUBLE(1))
  x:double
  ----------------------
  9.223372036854776E18
Fractional exponents
The exponent can be a fraction, which is similar to performing a root.
For example, the exponent of 0.5 will give the square root of the base:
    ROW base = 4, exponent = 0.5
    | EVAL s = POW(base, exponent)
  base:integer   exponent:double   s:double
  -------------- ----------------- ----------
  4              0.5               2.0
Table of supported input and output types
For clarity, the following table describes the output result type for
all combinations of numeric input types:
  base      exponent   result
  --------- ---------- ---------
  double    double     double
  double    integer    double
  integer   double     double
  integer   integer    integer
  long      double     double
  long      integer    long
