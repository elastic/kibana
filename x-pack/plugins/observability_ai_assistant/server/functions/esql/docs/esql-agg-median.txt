MEDIAN
The value that is greater than half of all values and less than half of
all values, also known as the 50% PERCENTILE.
    FROM employees
    | STATS MEDIAN(salary), PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
  MEDIAN(salary):double   PERCENTILE(salary,50):double
  ----------------------- ------------------------------
  47003                   47003
Like PERCENTILE, MEDIAN is usually approximate.
MEDIAN is also non-deterministic. This means you can get slightly
different results using the same data.
