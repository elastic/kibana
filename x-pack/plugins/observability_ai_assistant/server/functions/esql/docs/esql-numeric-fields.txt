Numeric fields

auto_bucket can also operate on numeric fields like this:
FROM employees
| WHERE hire_date >= "1985-01-01T00:00:00Z" AND hire_date < "1986-01-01T00:00:00Z"
| EVAL bs = AUTO_BUCKET(salary, 20, 25324, 74999)
| SORT hire_date, salary
| KEEP hire_date, salary, bs
Unlike the example above where you are intentionally filtering on a date range,
you rarely want to filter on a numeric range. So you have find the min and max
separately. We donâ€™t yet have an easy way to do that automatically. Improvements
coming!
