FROM

Syntax
FROM index_pattern [METADATA fields]
Parameters
index_pattern
A list of indices, data streams or aliases. Supports wildcards and date math.
fields
A comma-separated list of metadata fields to retrieve.
DescriptionThe FROM source command returns a table with data from a data stream, index,
or alias. Each row in the resulting table represents a document. Each column
corresponds to a field, and can be accessed by the name of that field.
By default, an ES|QL query without an explicit LIMIT uses an implicit
limit of 500. This applies to FROM too. A FROM command without LIMIT:
FROM employees
is executed as:
FROM employees
| LIMIT 500
Examples
FROM employees
You can use date math to refer to indices, aliases
and data streams. This can be useful for time series data, for example to access
todayâ€™s index:
FROM <logs-{now/d}>
Use comma-separated lists or wildcards to query multiple data streams, indices,
or aliases:
FROM employees-00001,other-employees-*
Use the METADATA directive to enable metadata fields:
FROM employees [METADATA _id]
