| EVAL successful = CASE(
    STARTS_WITH(message, "Connected to"), 1,
    message == "Connection error", 0
  )
| STATS success_rate = AVG(successful)
```

Calculate an hourly error rate as a percentage of the total number of log
messages:
```esql
FROM sample_data
| EVAL error = CASE(message LIKE "*error*", 1, 0)
| EVAL hour = DATE_TRUNC(1 hour, @timestamp)
| STATS error_rate = AVG(error) by hour
| SORT hour
```
