MEDIAN

The value that is greater than half of all values and less than half of
all values, also known as the 50% PERCENTILE.
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
```

Like PERCENTILE, MEDIAN is usually approximate.
MEDIAN is also non-deterministic.
This means you can get slightly different results using the same data.
