## Development

See the [kibana contributing guide](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions
setting up your development environment.

### Local checks before creating a PR

Kibana has a pretty long CI process.
Therefore, we suggest running the following commands locally before creating a PR:

1. Typescript check: `node_modules/.bin/tsc -b x-pack/plugins/cloud_security_posture/tsconfig.json --pretty`
2. Linter check: `yarn lint:es x-pack/plugins/cloud_security_posture`
3. Unit tests: `yarn jest --config x-pack/plugins/cloud_security_posture/jest.config.js`

### Install pre-commit hooks (optional)

We
use [pre-commit](https://docs.elastic.dev/kibana-dev-docs/getting-started/setup-dev-env#install-pre-commit-hook-optional)
to run linters and tests before each commit. To install the pre-commit hooks, run the following command from the root of
the repository:

```bash
node scripts/register_git_hook
```

### Running unit tests

Our [unit tests](https://docs.elastic.dev/kibana-dev-docs/tutorials/testing-plugins#unit-testing) are written
using [jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework.

As a convention, we use the `.test.ts` suffix for all our tests.

You can run all cloud security posture tests with the following command:

```bash
yarn jest --config x-pack/plugins/cloud_security_posture/jest.config.js
```

To run a specific test, you can use the `--testNamePattern` flag:

```bash
yarn jest --config x-pack/plugins/cloud_security_posture/jest.config.js --testNamePattern=FilePattern -t MyTest
```

### Running integration tests

The cloud security posture plugin has
also [integration tests](https://docs.elastic.dev/kibana-dev-docs/tutorials/testing-plugins#integration-tests) that run
against a real Elasticsearch and Kibana instances.
We use these tests to verify that the plugin works as expected when running in a real environment.
In order to run the integration tests, you need to have a running Elasticsearch and Kibana instances with the
integration test configuration.

You can run Kibana and Elastic with the integration test configuration by running the following command from the root of
the Kibana repository:

```bash
node scripts/functional_tests_server.js --config x-pack/test/api_integration/config.ts
```

** You should wait until the server is ready to accept connections before running the integration tests.

Then, in a separate terminal, you can run the integration test.
In order to do so, run the following command:

``` bash  
node scripts/functional_test_runner.js --config x-pack/test/api_integration/config.ts --include=test_file_path
```
