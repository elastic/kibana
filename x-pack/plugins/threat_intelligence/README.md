# Threat Intelligence

Elastic Threat Intelligence makes it easy to analyze and investigate potential security threats by aggregating data from multiple sources in one place. Youâ€™ll be able to view data from all activated threat intelligence feeds and take action.

### Where to find the UI for this plugin?

The Threat Intelligence UI is displayed in Kibana Security, under the Explore section.

## Development setup

### Kibana development in general

Best source - [internal Kibana docs](https://docs.elastic.dev/kibana-dev-docs/getting-started/welcome). If you have any issues with setting up your Kibana dev environment [#kibana](https://elastic.slack.com/archives/C0D8P2XK5) Slack channel is a good way to get help.

### Essential `kibana.yml` settings

You can make a copy of `kibana.yml` file into `kibana.dev.yml` and make adjustments to the settings. External documentation on the flags available is [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/settings.html)

It is recommended to set `server.basePath: "/kbn"` to make you local instance persist the base Kibana path. If you don't do it, the base path will be a random string every time you start Kibana. Any other value than `/kbn` will also work.

### Getting Threat Intelligence feeds data into Kibana

There are many ways to get data for you local development. We first focus on getting Threat Intelligence data specifically.

### Setting up filebeat threatintel integrations locally

1. install [mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage). It is a Go build tool used to build `beats`. Installation from the sources requires Go lang set up. A simpler option might be to install it from a package manager available in your system (eg. `brew` on MacOs) or use their [binary distribution](https://github.com/magefile/mage/releases)
1. start Elasticsearch and Kibana
1. clone [beats](https://github.com/elastic/beats) repository
1. inside beats repository, update `x-pack/filebeat/filebeat.yml` with your local Elasticsearch and Kibana connection configs

   ```
   output.elasticsearch:
   hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
   username: "elastic"
   password: "changeme"

   setup.kibana:
   host: "localhost:5601" // make sure to run Kibana with --no-base-path option or specify server.basePath in Kibana config and use it here as a path, eg. localhost:5601/kbn
   ```

1. go into `x-pack/filebeat` (that's where security related modules live)
1. build filebeat `mage build`
1. enable `threatintel` module by running `./filebeat modules enable threatintel`
1. enable specific Threat Intelligence integrations by updating `modules.d/threatintel.yml`. Update `enable` to `true` in every integration you want to enable and configs specific for these integrations. The bare minimum is to enable Abuse.CH feeds `abuseurl`, `abusemalware` and `malwarebazaar`.
1. run `./filebeat setup -E setup.dashboards.directory=build/kibana` to set up predefined dashboards
1. run `./filebeat -e` to start filebeat
1. to validate that the set up works, wait for some Threat Intel data to be ingested and then go in Analytics > Discover in your local Kibana to search `event.category : threat and event.type : indicator`. You should see some documents returned by this search. Abuse.CH feeds are up to date so you should see the results from the last 7 days.

### More ways to get data

There are many more tools available for getting the data for testing or local development, depending on the data type and usecase.

- Kibana development docs > [Add data](https://docs.elastic.dev/kibana-dev-docs/getting-started/sample-data)
- [Dev/Design/Testing Environments and Frameworks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DGCcLMnVKQ_STlkbS4E0m4kbPivNtR8iMlg_IoCuCEw/edit#) gathered by Security Engineering Productivity team

### Generate fixtures for local testing

You can generate large volumes of threat indicators on demand with the following script:

```
node scripts/generate_indicators.js
```

see the file in order to adjust the amount of indicators generated. The default is one million.

## E2E

### Data fixtures and loading process

Use es_archives to export data for e2e testing purposes, like so:

```
TEST_ES_PORT=9200 node scripts/es_archiver save x-pack/test/threat_intelligence_cypress/es_archives/threat_intelligence "logs-ti*"
```

These can be loaded at will with `x-pack/plugins/threat_intelligence/cypress/tasks/es_archiver.ts` task.

You can use this approach to load separate data dumps for every test case, to cover all critical scenarios.

### Running locally

`cd` into plugin root and execute `yarn cypress:open-as-ci`

### CI Execution

The entry point for PR testing is `.buildkite/pipelines/pull_request/threat_intelligence.yml` file, see that for details on
how the test suite is executed & extra options regarding parallelism, retrying etc.

E2E tests for this plugin will only be executed if any of the files changed within the PR matches dependency list here:
`.buildkite/scripts/pipelines/pull_request/pipeline.ts`

It is also possible to run all tests by attaching a PR flag: `ci:all-cypress-suites`.

## FAQ

### How is the Threat Intelligence code loaded in Kibana?

The Threat Intelligence plugin is loaded lazily within the [security_solution](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/main/x-pack/plugins/security_solution) plugin,
from `x-pack/plugins/security_solution/public/threat_intelligence` owned by the Protections Experience Team.

## QA and demo for implemented features

One way to QA and demo the feature merged into `main` branch is to run the latest `main` locally.
Another option is to deploy a Staging instance. For Staging environment snapshots are being build every night with the latest state of the `main` branch. More documentation can be found [here](https://cloud.elastic.dev/environments/Staging/#automatic-termination-of-staging-deployments)
