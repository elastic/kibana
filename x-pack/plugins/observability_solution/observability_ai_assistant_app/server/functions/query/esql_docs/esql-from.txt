FROM

Syntax
```esql
FROM index_pattern [METADATA fields] [OPTIONS options]
```

Parameters
index_pattern
A list of indices, data streams or aliases. Supports wildcards and date math.
fields
A comma-separated list of metadata fields to retrieve.
options
A comma-separated list of index options to configure
data access.
DescriptionThe
```esql
FROM source command returns a table with data from a data stream, index,
```

or alias. Each row in the resulting table represents a document. Each column
corresponds to a field, and can be accessed by the name of that field.
By default, an ES|QL query without an explicit LIMIT uses an implicit
limit of 1000. This applies to
```esql
FROM too. A FROM command without LIMIT:
```

```esql
FROM employees
```

is executed as:
```esql
FROM employees
| LIMIT 1000
```

Examples
```esql
FROM employees
```

You can use date math to refer to indices, aliases
and data streams. This can be useful for time series data, for example to access
todayâ€™s index:
```esql
FROM <logs-{now/d}>
```

Use comma-separated lists or wildcards to query multiple data streams, indices,
or aliases:
```esql
FROM employees-00001,other-employees-*
```

Use the format <remote_cluster_name>:<target> to query data streams and indices
on remote clusters:
```esql
FROM cluster_one:employees-00001,cluster_two:other-employees-*
```

See using ES|QL across clusters.Use the optional METADATA directive to enable metadata fields:
```esql
FROM employees METADATA _id
```

Use the optional OPTIONS directive to specify index access options.
This directive must follow METADATA, if both are specified:
```esql
FROM employees* METADATA _index OPTIONS "ignore_unavailable"="true"
```
