## ST_X

The `ST_X` function is used to extract the x coordinate from a provided point. If the point is of type `geo_point`, this is equivalent to extracting the longitude value.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use the `ST_X` function in ES|QL queries:

```esql
ROW point = TO_GEOPOINT("POINT(42.97109629958868 14.7552534006536)")
| EVAL x = ST_X(point)
```

In this example, the `ST_X` function is used to extract the x coordinate (or longitude) from a `geo_point` that is created using the `TO_GEOPOINT` function.

```esql
ROW point = TO_GEOPOINT("POINT(50.8503 4.3517)")
| EVAL x = ST_X(point)
```

In this second example, the `ST_X` function is used to extract the x coordinate (or longitude) from a different `geo_point`.
