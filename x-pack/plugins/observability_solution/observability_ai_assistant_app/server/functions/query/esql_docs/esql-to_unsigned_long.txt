TO_UNSIGNED_LONG

Syntax
Parameters
field
Input value. The input can be a single- or multi-valued column or an expression.
DescriptionConverts an input value to an unsigned long value. If the input parameter is of a date type, its value will be interpreted as milliseconds since the Unix epoch, converted to unsigned long. Boolean true will be converted to unsigned long 1, false to 0.Supported types
Example
```esql
ROW str1 = "2147483648", str2 = "2147483648.2", str3 = "foo"
| EVAL long1 = TO_UNSIGNED_LONG(str1), long2 = TO_ULONG(str2), long3 = TO_UL(str3)
```

Note that in this example, the last conversion of the string isnâ€™t possible.
When this happens, the result is a null value. In this case a Warning header is added to the response.
The header will provide information on the source of the failure:"Line 1:133: evaluation of [TO_UL(str3)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded."A following header will contain the failure reason and the offending value:"java.lang.NumberFormatException: Character f is neither a decimal digit number, decimal point,
+ "nor "e" notation exponential mark."
