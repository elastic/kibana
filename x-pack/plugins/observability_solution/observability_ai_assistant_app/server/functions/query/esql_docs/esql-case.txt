## CASE

The `CASE` function in ES|QL accepts pairs of conditions and values. It returns the value that belongs to the first condition that evaluates to true. If the number of arguments is odd, the last argument is the default value which is returned when no condition matches. If the number of arguments is even, and no condition matches, the function returns null.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use the `CASE` function in ES|QL:

1. Determine whether employees are monolingual, bilingual, or polyglot:

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL type = CASE(
    languages <= 1, "monolingual",
    languages <= 2, "bilingual",
     "polyglot")
| KEEP emp_no, languages, type
```

2. Calculate the total connection success rate based on log messages:

```esql
FROM sample_data
| EVAL successful = CASE(
    STARTS_WITH(message, "Connected to"), 1,
    message == "Connection error", 0
  )
| STATS success_rate = AVG(successful)
```

3. Calculate an hourly error rate as a percentage of the total number of log messages:

```esql
FROM sample_data
| EVAL error = CASE(message LIKE "*error*", 1, 0)
| STATS error_rate = AVG(error) BY BUCKET(@timestamp, 1 hour)
| SORT hour
```
