ST_DISJOINT


This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
Syntax
Parameters
geomA
Expression of type geo_point, cartesian_point, geo_shape or cartesian_shape. If null, the function returns null.
geomB
Expression of type geo_point, cartesian_point, geo_shape or cartesian_shape. If null, the function returns null.
The second parameter must also have the same coordinate system as the first.
This means it is not possible to combine geo_* and cartesian_* parameters.
DescriptionReturns whether the two geometries or geometry columns are disjoint.This is the inverse of the ST_INTERSECTS function.
In mathematical terms: ST_Disjoint(A, B) ⇔ A ⋂ B = ∅Supported types
Example
```esql
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE ST_DISJOINT(city_boundary, TO_GEOSHAPE("POLYGON((-10 -60, 120 -60, 120 60, -10 60, -10 -60))"))
| KEEP abbrev, airport, region, city, city_location
```
