## LOG10

The `LOG10` function in ES|QL is used to calculate the logarithm of a value to the base 10. The input can be any numeric value and the return value is always a double. If the input is 0 or a negative number, the function returns null and a warning.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use the `LOG10` function in ES|QL queries:

```esql
ROW d = 1000.0
| EVAL s = LOG10(d)
```

In this example, the `LOG10` function is used to calculate the base 10 logarithm of the value 1000. The result is stored in the variable `s`.

```esql
ROW d = 100.0
| EVAL s = LOG10(d)
```

In this example, the `LOG10` function is used to calculate the base 10 logarithm of the value 100. The result is stored in the variable `s`.
