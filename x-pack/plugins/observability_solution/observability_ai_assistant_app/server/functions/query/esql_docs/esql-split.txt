## SPLIT

The `SPLIT` function in ES|QL is used to split a single valued string into multiple strings based on a specified delimiter. 

### Syntax

`SPLIT(string, delim)`

#### Parameters

- `string`: This is the string expression that you want to split. If null, the function returns null.
- `delim`: This is the delimiter that will be used to split the string. Only single byte delimiters are currently supported.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use the `SPLIT` function in ES|QL:

```esql
ROW words="foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;corge"
| EVAL word = SPLIT(words, ";")
```

In this example, the string "foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;corge" is split into multiple strings using the semicolon (;) as the delimiter.

```esql
ROW data="John,Doe,30"
| EVAL details = SPLIT(data, ",")
```

In this second example, the string "John,Doe,30" is split into multiple strings using the comma (,) as the delimiter.
