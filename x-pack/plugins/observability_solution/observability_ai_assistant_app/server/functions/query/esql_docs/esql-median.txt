MEDIAN

Syntax
MEDIAN(expression)
Parameters
expression
Expression from which to return the median value.
DescriptionReturns the value that is greater than half of all values and less than half of
all values, also known as the 50% PERCENTILE.
Like PERCENTILE, MEDIAN is usually approximate.
MEDIAN is also non-deterministic.
This means you can get slightly different results using the same data.
Example
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
```

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the median of
the maximum values of a multivalued column, first use MV_MAX to get the
maximum value per row, and use the result with the MEDIAN function:
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS median_max_salary_change = MEDIAN(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```
