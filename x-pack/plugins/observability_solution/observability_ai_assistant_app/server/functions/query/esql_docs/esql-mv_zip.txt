## MV_ZIP

The `MV_ZIP` function in ES|QL combines the values from two multivalued fields with a delimiter that joins them together.

### Syntax

`MV_ZIP(string1, string2, delim)`

#### Parameters

- `string1`: Multivalue expression.
- `string2`: Multivalue expression.
- `delim`: Delimiter. Optional; if omitted, `,` is used as a default delimiter.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use the `MV_ZIP` function in your ES|QL queries:

```esql
ROW a = ["x", "y", "z"], b = ["1", "2"]
| EVAL c = MV_ZIP(a, b, "-")
| KEEP a, b, c
```

In this example, the `MV_ZIP` function is used to combine the values from the `a` and `b` fields with a `-` delimiter. The result is stored in the `c` field.

```esql
ROW a = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], b = ["red", "yellow", "red"]
| EVAL fruit_color = MV_ZIP(a, b, " is ")
| KEEP a, b, fruit_color
```

In this second example, the `MV_ZIP` function is used to combine the values from the `a` and `b` fields with ` is ` as the delimiter. The result is stored in the `fruit_color` field.
