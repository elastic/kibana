## ROW

The `ROW` command in ES|QL is used to produce a row with one or more columns with specified values. This can be particularly useful for testing purposes. 

### Syntax

The syntax for the `ROW` command is as follows:

```
ROW column1 = value1[, ..., columnN = valueN]
```

#### Parameters

- `columnX`: The name of the column.
- `valueX`: The value for the column. This can be a literal, an expression, or a function.

### Examples

Here are some examples of how the `ROW` command can be used in ES|QL:

1. Creating a row with specified values:

    ```esql
ROW a = 1, b = "two", c = null
```

2. Using square brackets to create multi-value columns:

    ```esql
ROW a = [2, 1]
```

3. Using functions within the `ROW` command:

    ```esql
ROW a = ROUND(1.23, 0)
```

### Limitations

There are no known limitations for the `ROW` command in ES|QL.
