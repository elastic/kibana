## DROP

The `DROP` command in ES|QL is used to remove one or more columns from the data. This can be useful in scenarios where certain columns are not needed for further data processing or analysis. 

The command supports the use of wildcards, allowing for the removal of all columns that match a specific pattern. This can be particularly useful when dealing with large datasets with numerous columns.

### Syntax

The syntax for the `DROP` command is as follows:

```
DROP columns
```

Here, `columns` is a comma-separated list of columns to be removed. Wildcards are supported.

### Examples

Here are some examples of how the `DROP` command can be used in ES|QL queries:

1. Removing a single column:

```esql
FROM employees
| DROP height
```

In this example, the `height` column is removed from the `employees` data.

2. Removing multiple columns:

```esql
FROM employees
| DROP height, weight, age
```

Here, the `height`, `weight`, and `age` columns are all removed from the `employees` data.

3. Using wildcards to remove all columns that match a pattern:

```esql
FROM employees
| DROP height*
```

In this example, all columns that start with `height` are removed from the `employees` data.
