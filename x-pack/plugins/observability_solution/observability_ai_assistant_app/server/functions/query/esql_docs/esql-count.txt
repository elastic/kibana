COUNT

Syntax
COUNT([expression])
Parameters
expression
Expression that outputs values to be counted.
If omitted, equivalent to COUNT(*) (the number of rows).
DescriptionReturns the total number (count) of input values.Supported typesCan take any field type as input.Examples
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS COUNT(height)
```

To count the number of rows, use COUNT() or COUNT(*):
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS count = COUNT(*) BY languages
| SORT languages DESC
```

The expression can use inline functions. This example splits a string into
multiple values using the SPLIT function and counts the values:
```esql
ROW words="foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;foo"
| STATS word_count = COUNT(SPLIT(words, ";"))
```
