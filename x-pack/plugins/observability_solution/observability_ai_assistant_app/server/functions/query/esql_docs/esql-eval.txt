EVAL

Syntax
EVAL [column1 =] value1[, ..., [columnN =] valueN]
Parameters
columnX
The column name.
valueX
The value for the column. Can be a literal, an expression, or a
function.
DescriptionThe EVAL processing command enables you to append new columns with calculated
values. EVAL supports various functions for calculating values. Refer to
Functions for more information.Examples
```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height_feet = height * 3.281, height_cm = height * 100
```

If the specified column already exists, the existing column will be dropped, and
the new column will be appended to the table:
```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height = height * 3.281
```

Specifying the output column name is optional. If not specified, the new column
name is equal to the expression. The following query adds a column named
height*3.281:
```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height * 3.281
```

Because this name contains special characters, it needs to be
quoted with backticks (`) when using it in subsequent commands:
```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL height * 3.281
| STATS avg_height_feet = AVG(`height * 3.281`)
```
