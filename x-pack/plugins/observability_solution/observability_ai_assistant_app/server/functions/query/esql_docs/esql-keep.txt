KEEP

Syntax
KEEP columns
Parameters
columns
A comma-separated list of columns to keep. Supports wildcards.
DescriptionThe KEEP processing command enables you to specify what columns are returned
and the order in which they are returned.Precedence rules are applied when a field name matches multiple expressions.
Fields are added in the order they appear. If one field matches multiple expressions, the following precedence rules apply (from highest to lowest priority):
Complete field name (no wildcards)
Partial wildcard expressions (for example: fieldNam*)
Wildcard only (*)
If a field matches two expressions with the same precedence, the right-most expression wins.Refer to the examples for illustrations of these precedence rules.ExamplesThe columns are returned in the specified order:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP emp_no, first_name, last_name, height
```

Rather than specify each column by name, you can use wildcards to return all
columns with a name that matches a pattern:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*
```

The asterisk wildcard (*) by itself translates to all columns that do not
match the other arguments.This query will first return all columns with a name
that starts with h, followed by all other columns:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP h*, *
```

The following examples show how precedence rules work when a field name matches multiple expressions.Complete field name has precedence over wildcard expressions:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, first_name*
```

Wildcard expressions have the same priority, but last one wins (despite being less specific):
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name*, last_name, first_na*
```

A simple wildcard expression * has the lowest precedence.
Output order is determined by the other arguments:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP *, first_name
```
