## MIN

The `MIN` function in ES|QL is used to return the minimum value of a numeric expression.

### Syntax:

`MIN(expression)`

#### Parameters:

`expression`: The expression from which to return the minimum value.

### Examples:

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use the `MIN` function in ES|QL:

1. To find the minimum value of a field, you can use the `MIN` function directly. For example, the following query returns the minimum value of the `languages` field from the `employees` index:

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MIN(languages)
```

2. You can also use the `MIN` function with other functions like `MV_AVG` to perform more complex calculations. For example, the following query calculates the average of a multivalued column `salary_change` for each row, and then finds the minimum of these averages:

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS min_avg_salary_change = MIN(MV_AVG(salary_change))
```
