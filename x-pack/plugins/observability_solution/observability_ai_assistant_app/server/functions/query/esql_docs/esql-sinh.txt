## SINH

The `SINH` function in ES|QL returns the hyperbolic sine of an angle. The angle should be provided in radians. If the provided angle is null, the function will return null.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use the `SINH` function in ES|QL:

```esql
ROW a=1.8
| EVAL sinh = SINH(a)
```

In this example, the `SINH` function is used to calculate the hyperbolic sine of the angle `1.8` radians.

```esql
ROW a=3.14
| EVAL sinh_value = SINH(a)
```

In this second example, the `SINH` function is used to calculate the hyperbolic sine of the angle `3.14` radians. The result is stored in the `sinh_value` variable.
