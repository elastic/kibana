ST_INTERSECTS


This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
Syntax
Parameters
geomA
Expression of type geo_point, cartesian_point, geo_shape or cartesian_shape. If null, the function returns null.
geomB
Expression of type geo_point, cartesian_point, geo_shape or cartesian_shape. If null, the function returns null.
The second parameter must also have the same coordinate system as the first.
This means it is not possible to combine geo_* and cartesian_* parameters.
DescriptionReturns true if two geometries intersect.
They intersect if they have any point in common, including their interior points
(points along lines or within polygons).
This is the inverse of the ST_DISJOINT function.
In mathematical terms: ST_Intersects(A, B) ⇔ A ⋂ B ≠ ∅Supported types
Example
```esql
FROM airports
| WHERE ST_INTERSECTS(location, TO_GEOSHAPE("POLYGON((42 14, 43 14, 43 15, 42 15, 42 14))"))
```
