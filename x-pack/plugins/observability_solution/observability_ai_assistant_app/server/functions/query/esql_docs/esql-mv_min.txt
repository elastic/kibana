## MV_MIN

The `MV_MIN` function in ES|QL is used to convert a multivalued expression into a single valued column containing the minimum value. This function can be used with any column type, including keyword columns. In the case of keyword columns, it picks the first string, comparing their utf-8 representation byte by byte.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how to use the `MV_MIN` function in ES|QL:

```esql
ROW a=[2, 1]
| EVAL min_a = MV_MIN(a)
```

In this example, the `MV_MIN` function is used to find the minimum value in the array `[2, 1]`. The result is stored in the `min_a` column.

```esql
ROW a=["foo", "bar"]
| EVAL min_a = MV_MIN(a)
```

In this example, the `MV_MIN` function is used to find the minimum value in the array `["foo", "bar"]`. Since these are string values, the function compares their utf-8 representation byte by byte. The result is stored in the `min_a` column.
