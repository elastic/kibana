COUNT_DISTINCT

Syntax
COUNT_DISTINCT(expression[, precision_threshold])
Parameters
expression
Expression that outputs the values on which to perform a distinct count.
precision_threshold
Precision threshold. Refer to Counts are approximate. The
maximum supported value is 40000. Thresholds above this number will have the
same effect as a threshold of 40000. The default value is 3000.
DescriptionReturns the approximate number of distinct values.Supported typesCan take any field type as input.Examples
```esql
FROM hosts
| STATS COUNT_DISTINCT(ip0), COUNT_DISTINCT(ip1)
```

With the optional second parameter to configure the precision threshold:
```esql
FROM hosts
| STATS COUNT_DISTINCT(ip0, 80000), COUNT_DISTINCT(ip1, 5)
```

The expression can use inline functions. This example splits a string into
multiple values using the SPLIT function and counts the unique values:
```esql
ROW words="foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;foo"
| STATS distinct_word_count = COUNT_DISTINCT(SPLIT(words, ";"))
```

Counts are approximateeditComputing exact counts requires loading values into a set and returning its
size. This doesnâ€™t scale when working on high-cardinality sets and/or large
values as the required memory usage and the need to communicate those
per-shard sets between nodes would utilize too many resources of the cluster.This COUNT_DISTINCT function is based on the
HyperLogLog++
algorithm, which counts based on the hashes of the values with some interesting
properties:
configurable precision, which decides on how to trade memory for accuracy,
excellent accuracy on low-cardinality sets,
fixed memory usage: no matter if there are tens or billions of unique values,
memory usage only depends on the configured precision.
For a precision threshold of c, the implementation that we are using requires
about c * 8 bytes.The following chart shows how the error varies before and after the threshold:For all 3 thresholds, counts have been accurate up to the configured threshold.
Although not guaranteed, this is likely to be the case. Accuracy in practice depends
on the dataset in question. In general, most datasets show consistently good
accuracy. Also note that even with a threshold as low as 100, the error
remains very low (1-6% as seen in the above graph) even when counting millions of items.The HyperLogLog++ algorithm depends on the leading zeros of hashed
values, the exact distributions of hashes in a dataset can affect the
accuracy of the cardinality.The COUNT_DISTINCT function takes an optional second parameter to configure
the precision threshold. The precision_threshold options allows to trade memory
for accuracy, and defines a unique count below which counts are expected to be
close to accurate. Above this value, counts might become a bit more fuzzy. The
maximum supported value is 40000, thresholds above this number will have the
same effect as a threshold of 40000. The default value is 3000.
