WHERE

Syntax
WHERE expression
Parameters
expression
A boolean expression.
DescriptionThe WHERE processing command produces a table that contains all the rows from
the input table for which the provided condition evaluates to true.Examples
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, still_hired
| WHERE still_hired == true
```

Which, if still_hired is a boolean field, can be simplified to:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, still_hired
| WHERE still_hired
```

Use date math to retrieve data from a specific time range. For example, to
retrieve the last hour of logs:
```esql
FROM sample_data
| WHERE @timestamp > NOW() - 1 hour
```

WHERE supports various functions. For example the
LENGTH function:
```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| WHERE LENGTH(first_name) < 4
```

For a complete list of all functions, refer to Functions overview.For NULL comparison, use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL predicates:
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE birth_date IS NULL
| KEEP first_name, last_name
| SORT first_name
| LIMIT 3
```

```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE is_rehired IS NOT NULL
| STATS COUNT(emp_no)
```

Use LIKE to filter data based on string patterns using wildcards. LIKE
usually acts on a field placed on the left-hand side of the operator, but it can
also act on a constant (literal) expression. The right-hand side of the operator
represents the pattern.The following wildcard characters are supported:
* matches zero or more characters.
? matches one character.
Supported types
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE first_name LIKE "?b*"
| KEEP first_name, last_name
```

Use RLIKE to filter data based on string patterns using using
regular expressions. RLIKE usually acts on a field placed on
the left-hand side of the operator, but it can also act on a constant (literal)
expression. The right-hand side of the operator represents the pattern.Supported types
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE first_name RLIKE ".leja.*"
| KEEP first_name, last_name
```

The IN operator allows testing whether a field or expression equals
an element in a list of literals, fields or expressions:
```esql
ROW a = 1, b = 4, c = 3
| WHERE c-a IN (3, b / 2, a)
```
