This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

Expression of type geo_point, cartesian_point, geo_shape or cartesian_shape. If null, the function returns null.
