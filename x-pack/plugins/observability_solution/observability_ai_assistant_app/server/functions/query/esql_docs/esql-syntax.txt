ES|QL syntax referenceedit
Basic syntaxedit
An ES|QL query is composed of a source command followed
by an optional series of processing commands,
separated by a pipe character: `|`. For example:
source-command
| processing-command1
| processing-command2
The result of a query is the table produced by the final processing command.
For an overview of all supported commands, functions, and operators, refer to Commands and Functions and operators.
For readability, this documentation puts each processing command on a new
line. However, you can write an ES|QL query as a single line. The following
query is identical to the previous one:
source-command | processing-command1 | processing-command2
Identifiersedit
Identifiers need to be quoted with backticks (```) if:
they don’t start with a letter, `_` or `@`
any of the other characters is not a letter, number, or `_`
For example:
```esql
FROM index
| KEEP `1.field`
```

When referencing a function alias that itself uses a quoted identifier, the
backticks of the quoted identifier need to be escaped with another backtick. For
example:
```esql
FROM index
| STATS COUNT(`1.field`)
| EVAL my_count = `COUNT(``1.field``)`
```

Literalsedit
ES|QL currently supports numeric and string literals.
String literalsedit
A string literal is a sequence of unicode characters delimited by double
quotes (`"`).
// Filter by a string value
```esql
FROM index
| WHERE first_name == "Georgi"
```

If the literal string itself contains quotes, these need to be escaped (`\\"`).
ES|QL also supports the triple-quotes (`"""`) delimiter, for convenience:
```esql
ROW name = """Indiana "Indy" Jones"""
```

The special characters CR, LF and TAB can be provided with the usual escaping:
`\r`, `\n`, `\t`, respectively.
Numerical literalsedit
The numeric literals are accepted in decimal and in the scientific notation
with the exponent marker (`e` or `E`), starting either with a digit, decimal
point `.` or the negative sign `-`:
1969    -- integer notation
3.14    -- decimal notation
.1234   -- decimal notation starting with decimal point
4E5     -- scientific notation (with exponent marker)
1.2e-3  -- scientific notation with decimal point
-.1e2   -- scientific notation starting with the negative sign
The integer numeric literals are implicitly converted to the `integer`, `long`
or the `double` type, whichever can first accommodate the literal’s value.
The floating point literals are implicitly converted the `double` type.
To obtain constant values of different types, use one of the numeric
conversion functions.
Commentsedit
ES|QL uses C++ style comments:
double slash `//` for single line comments
`/*` and `*/` for block comments
// Query the employees index
```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE height > 2
```

```esql
FROM /* Query the employees index */ employees
| WHERE height > 2
```

```esql
FROM employees
```

/* Query the
 * employees
 * index */
| WHERE height > 2
Timespan literalsedit
Datetime intervals and timespans can be expressed using timespan literals.
Timespan literals are a combination of a number and a qualifier. These
qualifiers are supported:
`millisecond`/`milliseconds`
`second`/`seconds`
`minute`/`minutes`
`hour`/`hours`
`day`/`days`
`week`/`weeks`
`month`/`months`
`year`/`years`
Timespan literals are not whitespace sensitive. These expressions are all valid:
`1day`
`1 day`
`1       day`
