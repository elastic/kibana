MV_LAST

Syntax
Parameters
field
Multivalue expression.
DescriptionConverts a multivalue expression into a single valued column containing the last value. This is most useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued columns in a known order like SPLIT.  The order that multivalued fields are read from underlying storage is not guaranteed. It is frequently ascending, but don’t rely on that. If you need the maximum value use MV_MAX instead of MV_LAST. MV_MAX has optimizations for sorted values so there isn’t a performance benefit to MV_LAST.Supported types
Example
```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL last_a = MV_LAST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```
