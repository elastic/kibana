MV_LAST

Syntax
Parameters
v
Multivalue expression.
DescriptionConverts a multivalue expression into a single valued column containing the last
value. This is most useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued
columns in a known order like SPLIT.The order that multivalued fields are read from
underlying storage is not guaranteed. It is frequently ascending, but don’t
rely on that. If you need the maximum value use MV_MAX instead of
MV_LAST. MV_MAX has optimizations for sorted values so there isn’t a
performance benefit to MV_LAST.Supported types
Example
```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL last_a = MV_LAST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```
