POW

Syntax
Parameters
base
Numeric expression for the base. If null, the function returns null.
exponent
Numeric expression for the exponent. If null, the function returns null.
DescriptionReturns the value of base raised to the power of exponent.
It is still possible to overflow a double result here; in that case, null will be returned.
Supported types
Examples
```esql
ROW base = 2.0, exponent = 2
| EVAL result = POW(base, exponent)
```

The exponent can be a fraction, which is similar to performing a root.
For example, the exponent of 0.5 will give the square root of the base:
```esql
ROW base = 4, exponent = 0.5
| EVAL s = POW(base, exponent)
```
