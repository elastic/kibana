## POW

The `POW` function in ES|QL returns the value of a base raised to the power of an exponent. It takes two numeric expressions as parameters: the base and the exponent. If either of these parameters is null, the function will return null. It's important to note that it is still possible to overflow a double result here; in that case, null will be returned.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of full ES|QL queries using the `POW` function:

1. This query calculates the result of 2.0 raised to the power of 2:

```esql
ROW base = 2.0, exponent = 2
| EVAL result = POW(base, exponent)
```

2. This query calculates the square root of 4 by raising 4 to the power of 0.5:

```esql
ROW base = 4, exponent = 0.5
| EVAL s = POW(base, exponent)
```
