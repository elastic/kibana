## SIN

The `SIN` function in ES|QL is used to calculate the sine of an angle. The angle should be provided in radians. If the provided angle is null, the function will return null.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use the `SIN` function in ES|QL:

```esql
ROW a=1.8
| EVAL sin = SIN(a)
```

In this example, the `SIN` function is used to calculate the sine of the angle `1.8` radians. The result is stored in the `sin` variable.

```esql
ROW a=3.14
| EVAL sin_value = SIN(a)
```

In this second example, the `SIN` function is used to calculate the sine of the angle `3.14` radians (approximately equal to Ï€, the angle for a half circle in the unit circle). The result is stored in the `sin_value` variable.
