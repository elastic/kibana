DATE_DIFF

Syntax
Parameters
unit
Time difference unit
startTimestamp
A string representing a start timestamp
endTimestamp
A string representing an end timestamp
DescriptionSubtracts the startTimestamp from the endTimestamp and returns the difference in multiples of unit. If startTimestamp is later than the endTimestamp, negative values are returned.
Note that while there is an overlap between the function’s supported units and
ES|QL’s supported time span literals, these sets are distinct and not
interchangeable. Similarly, the supported abbreviations are conveniently shared
with implementations of this function in other established products and not
necessarily common with the date-time nomenclature used by Elasticsearch.Supported types
Example
```esql
ROW date1 = TO_DATETIME("2023-12-02T11:00:00.000Z"), date2 = TO_DATETIME("2023-12-02T11:00:00.001Z")
| EVAL dd_ms = DATE_DIFF("microseconds", date1, date2)
```
