TO_LONG

Syntax
Parameters
field
Input value. The input can be a single- or multi-valued column or an expression.
DescriptionConverts an input value to a long value. If the input parameter is of a date type, its value will be interpreted as milliseconds since the Unix epoch, converted to long. Boolean true will be converted to long 1, false to 0.Supported types
Example
```esql
ROW str1 = "2147483648", str2 = "2147483648.2", str3 = "foo"
| EVAL long1 = TO_LONG(str1), long2 = TO_LONG(str2), long3 = TO_LONG(str3)
```

Note that in this example, the last conversion of the string isnâ€™t possible.
When this happens, the result is a null value. In this case a Warning header is added to the response.
The header will provide information on the source of the failure:"Line 1:113: evaluation of [TO_LONG(str3)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded."A following header will contain the failure reason and the offending value:"java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "foo""
