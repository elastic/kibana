## LIMIT

The `LIMIT` command in ES|QL is a processing command that allows you to limit the number of rows that are returned in a query. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you only need a specific number of rows from a larger dataset.

However, it's important to note that queries do not return more than 10,000 rows, regardless of the `LIMIT` commandâ€™s value. This limit only applies to the number of rows that are retrieved by the query. Queries and aggregations run on the full data set.

To overcome this limitation, you can:

- Reduce the result set size by modifying the query to only return relevant data. Use `WHERE` to select a smaller subset of the data.
- Shift any post-query processing to the query itself. You can use the ES|QL `STATS ... BY` command to aggregate data in the query.

The default and maximum limits can be changed using these dynamic cluster settings:

- `esql.query.result_truncation_default_size`
- `esql.query.result_truncation_max_size`

### Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the `LIMIT` command in ES|QL:

1. Limit the number of rows returned to 5, sorted by employee number in ascending order:

    ```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no ASC
| LIMIT 5
```

2. Retrieve only the top 10 employees with the highest salary:

    ```esql
FROM employees
| SORT salary DESC
| LIMIT 10
```

3. Get the first 100 rows from a logs data stream:

    ```esql
FROM logs-*
| LIMIT 100
```
