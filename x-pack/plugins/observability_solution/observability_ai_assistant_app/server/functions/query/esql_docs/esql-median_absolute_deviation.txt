## MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION

The `MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION` function is a robust statistic that is useful for describing data that may have outliers or may not be normally distributed. It provides a measure of variability by calculating the median of each data pointâ€™s deviation from the median of the entire sample. 

This function is usually approximate and non-deterministic, meaning that you can get slightly different results using the same data.

### Syntax:

`MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(expression)`

#### Parameters:

- `expression`: Expression from which to return the median absolute deviation.

### Examples:

Here is an example of a complete ES|QL query using the `MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION` function:

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(salary)
```

In this query, the `MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION` function is used to calculate the median absolute deviation of the `salary` field for the `employees` index.

The `MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION` function can also be used with inline functions. Here is an example where it is used with the `MV_MAX` function to calculate the median absolute deviation of the maximum values of a multivalued column:

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS m_a_d_max_salary_change = MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

In this query, the `MV_MAX` function is first used to get the maximum value per row of the `salary_change` field. The result is then used with the `MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION` function to calculate the median absolute deviation.
