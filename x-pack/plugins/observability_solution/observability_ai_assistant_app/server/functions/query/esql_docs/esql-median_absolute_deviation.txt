MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION

The median absolute deviation, a measure of variability. It is a robust
statistic, meaning that it is useful for describing data that may have outliers,
or may not be normally distributed. For such data it can be more descriptive than
standard deviation.It is calculated as the median of each data pointâ€™s deviation from the median of
the entire sample. That is, for a random variable X, the median absolute deviation
is median(|median(X) - Xi|).
```esql

| STATS MEDIAN(salary), MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(salary)
```

Like PERCENTILE, MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION is
      usually approximate.
MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION is also non-deterministic.
This means you can get slightly different results using the same data.
