MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION

Syntax
MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(expression)
Parameters
expression
Expression from which to return the median absolute deviation.
DescriptionReturns the median absolute deviation, a measure of variability. It is a robust
statistic, meaning that it is useful for describing data that may have outliers,
or may not be normally distributed. For such data it can be more descriptive
than standard deviation.It is calculated as the median of each data pointâ€™s deviation from the median of
the entire sample. That is, for a random variable X, the median absolute
deviation is median(|median(X) - X|).
Like PERCENTILE, MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION is
      usually approximate.
MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION is also non-deterministic.
This means you can get slightly different results using the same data.
Example
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(salary)
```

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the the
median absolute deviation of the maximum values of a multivalued column, first
use MV_MAX to get the maximum value per row, and use the result with the
MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION function:
```esql
FROM employees
| STATS m_a_d_max_salary_change = MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```
