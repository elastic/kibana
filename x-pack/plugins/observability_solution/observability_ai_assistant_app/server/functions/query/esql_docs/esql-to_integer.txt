## TO_INTEGER

The `TO_INTEGER` function converts an input value to an integer value. If the input parameter is of a date type, its value will be interpreted as milliseconds since the Unix epoch, converted to integer. Boolean `true` will be converted to integer `1`, `false` to `0`.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of full ES|QL queries using the `TO_INTEGER` function:

```esql
ROW long = [5013792, 2147483647, 501379200000]
| EVAL int = TO_INTEGER(long)
```

In this example, the last value of the multi-valued field cannot be converted as an integer. When this happens, the result is a null value. A Warning header is added to the response providing information on the source of the failure:

```esql
"Line 1:61: evaluation of [TO_INTEGER(long)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded."
```

A following header will contain the failure reason and the offending value:

```
"org.elasticsearch.xpack.esql.core.InvalidArgumentException: [501379200000] out of [integer] range"
```
