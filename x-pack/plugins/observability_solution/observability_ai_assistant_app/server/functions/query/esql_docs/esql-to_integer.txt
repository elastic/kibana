TO_INTEGER

Syntax
Parameters
field
Input value. The input can be a single- or multi-valued column or an expression.
DescriptionConverts an input value to an integer value. If the input parameter is of a date type, its value will be interpreted as milliseconds since the Unix epoch, converted to integer. Boolean true will be converted to integer 1, false to 0.Supported types
Example
```esql
ROW long = [5013792, 2147483647, 501379200000]
| EVAL int = TO_INTEGER(long)
```

Note that in this example, the last value of the multi-valued field cannot be converted as an integer.
When this happens, the result is a null value. In this case a Warning header is added to the response.
The header will provide information on the source of the failure:"Line 1:61: evaluation of [TO_INTEGER(long)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded."A following header will contain the failure reason and the offending value:"org.elasticsearch.xpack.ql.InvalidArgumentException: [501379200000] out of [integer] range"
