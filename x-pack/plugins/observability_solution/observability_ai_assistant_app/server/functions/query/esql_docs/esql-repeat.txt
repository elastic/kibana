## REPEAT

The `REPEAT` function in ES|QL is used to construct a string by concatenating a given string with itself a specified number of times.

### Syntax

`REPEAT(string, number)`

#### Parameters

- `string`: The string expression that you want to repeat.
- `number`: The number of times you want to repeat the string.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use the `REPEAT` function in ES|QL:

```esql
ROW a = "Hello!"
| EVAL triple_a = REPEAT(a, 3)
```

In this example, the string "Hello!" is repeated 3 times, resulting in "Hello!Hello!Hello!".

```esql
ROW b = "ES|QL "
| EVAL five_b = REPEAT(b, 5)
```

In this example, the string "ES|QL " is repeated 5 times, resulting in "ES|QL ES|QL ES|QL ES|QL ES|QL ".
