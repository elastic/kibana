## LEAST

The `LEAST` function in ES|QL is used to return the minimum value from multiple columns. This function is similar to `MV_MIN` but is intended to run on multiple columns at once.

### Syntax

`LEAST(first, rest)`

#### Parameters

- `first`: The first column to evaluate.
- `rest`: The rest of the columns to evaluate.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how to use the `LEAST` function in ES|QL:

```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 20
| EVAL l = LEAST(a, b)
```

In this example, the `LEAST` function is used to find the minimum value between the columns `a` and `b`.

```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 20, c = 30, d = 40
| EVAL l = LEAST(a, b, c, d)
```

In this second example, the `LEAST` function is used to find the minimum value among four columns: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
