LEAST


Returns the minimum value from many columns. This is similar to MV_MIN
except it’s intended to run on multiple columns at once.
```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 20
| EVAL l = LEAST(a, b)
```

When run on keyword or text fields, this’ll return the first string
      in alphabetical order. When run on boolean columns this will return
      false if any values are false.
