## NOW

The `NOW` function in ES|QL returns the current date and time.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use the `NOW` function in ES|QL queries:

1. To get the current date and time, you can use the `NOW` function in a `ROW` command:

```esql
ROW current_date = NOW()
```

2. To retrieve logs from the last hour, you can use the `NOW` function in a `WHERE` clause:

```esql
FROM sample_data
| WHERE @timestamp > NOW() - 1 hour
```
