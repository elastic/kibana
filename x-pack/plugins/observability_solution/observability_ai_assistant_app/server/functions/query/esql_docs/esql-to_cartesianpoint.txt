## TO_CARTESIANPOINT

The `TO_CARTESIANPOINT` function converts an input value to a `cartesian_point` value. This conversion will only be successful if the input string respects the WKT Point format.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples of how you can use the `TO_CARTESIANPOINT` function in ES|QL queries:

```esql
ROW wkt = ["POINT(4297.11 -1475.53)", "POINT(7580.93 2272.77)"]
| MV_EXPAND wkt
| EVAL pt = TO_CARTESIANPOINT(wkt)
```

In this example, the `TO_CARTESIANPOINT` function is used to convert the values in the `wkt` field (which are in WKT Point format) to `cartesian_point` values. The `MV_EXPAND` function is used to expand the multi-valued `wkt` field into individual rows, and then the `TO_CARTESIANPOINT` function is applied to each row.

```esql
ROW wkt = "POINT(4297.11 -1475.53)"
| EVAL pt = TO_CARTESIANPOINT(wkt)
```

In this second example, the `TO_CARTESIANPOINT` function is used to convert a single WKT Point string to a `cartesian_point` value.
