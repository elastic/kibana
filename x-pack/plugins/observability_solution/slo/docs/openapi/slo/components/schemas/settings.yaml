type: object
properties:
  syncField:
    description: The date field that is used to identify new documents in the source. It is strongly recommended to use a field that contains the ingest timestamp. If you use a different field, you might need to set the delay such that it accounts for data transmission delays. When unspecified, we use the indicator timestamp field.
    type: string
    example: 'event.ingested'
  syncDelay:
    description: The time delay in minutes between the current time and the latest source data time. Increasing the value will delay any alerting. The default value is 1 minute. The minimum value is 1m and the maximum is 359m. It should always be greater then source index refresh interval.
    type: string
    default: 1m
    example: 5m
  frequency:
    description: The interval between checks for changes in the source data. The minimum value is 1m and the maximum is 59m. The default value is 1 minute.
    type: string
    default: 1m
    example: 5m
  preventInitialBackfill:
    description: Start aggregating data from the time the SLO is created, instead of backfilling data from the beginning of the time window.
    type: boolean
    default: false
    example: true
