# vis_type_timeseries_enhanced

The `vis_type_timeseries_enhanced` plugin is the x-pack counterpart to the OSS `vis_type_timeseries` plugin.

It exists to provide Elastic-licensed services, or parts of services, which
enhance existing OSS functionality from `vis_type_timeseries`.

Currently the `vis_type_timeseries_enhanced` plugin doesn't return any APIs which you can
consume directly.
