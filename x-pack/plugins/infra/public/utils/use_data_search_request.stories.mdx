# The `data` plugin and `SearchStrategies`

The search functionality abstraction provided by the `search` service of the
`data` plugin is pretty powerful:

- The execution of the request is delegated to a search strategy, which is
    executed on the Kibana server side.
- Any plugin can register custom search strategies with custom parameters and
    response shapes.
- Requests can be cancelled via an `AbortSignal`.
- Partial responses can be returned as they become available if the search
    takes longer.

code.
