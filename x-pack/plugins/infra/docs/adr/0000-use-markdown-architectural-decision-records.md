# Use Markdown Architectural Decision Records

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2019-02-22

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record architectural decisions made and patterns agreed upon in this project.
Which format and structure should these records follow?

## Considered Options

* [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) 2.1.2 – The Markdown Architectural Decision Records
* Formless – No conventions for file format and structure

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MADR 2.1.2", because

* Implicit assumptions should be made explicit.
  Design documentation is important to enable people understanding the decisions later on.
  See also [A rational design process: How and why to fake it](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940).
* The MADR format is lean and fits our development style.
* The MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance.
* The MADR project is vivid.
* Version 2.1.2 is the latest one available when starting to document ADRs.
