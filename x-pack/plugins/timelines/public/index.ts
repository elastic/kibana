// Careful of exporting anything from this file as any file(s) you export here will cause your page bundle size to increase.
// If you're using functions/types/etc... internally or within integration tests it's best to import directly from their paths
// than expose the functions/types/etc... here. You should _only_ expose functions/types/etc... that need to be shared with other plugins here.

// When you do have to add things here you might want to consider creating a package to share with
// other plugins instead as packages are easier to break down and you do not have to carry the cost of extra plugin weight on
// first download since the other plugins/areas of your code can directly pull from the package in their async imports.
// See: https://docs.elastic.dev/kibana-dev-docs/key-concepts/platform-intro#public-plugin-api
