# Ingest Manager

## Plugin

- The plugin is disabled by default. See the TypeScript type for the [the available plugin configuration options](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/ingest_manager/common/types/index.ts#L9-L27)
- Setting `xpack.ingestManager.enabled=true` enables the plugin including the EPM and Fleet features. It also adds the `DATASOURCE_API_ROUTES` and `AGENT_CONFIG_API_ROUTES` values in [`common/constants/routes.ts`](./common/constants/routes.ts)
- Adding `--xpack.ingestManager.epm.enabled=false` will disable the EPM API & UI
- Adding `--xpack.ingestManager.fleet.enabled=false` will disable the Fleet API & UI
  - [code for adding the routes](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/1f27d349533b1c2865c10c45b2cf705d7416fb36/x-pack/plugins/ingest_manager/server/plugin.ts#L115-L133)
  - [Integration tests](server/integration_tests/router.test.ts)
- Both EPM and Fleet require `ingestManager` be enabled. They are not standalone features.

## Development

### Getting started

See the Kibana docs for [how to set up your dev environment](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-your-development-environment), [run Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-elasticsearch), and [start Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-kibana)

One common development workflow is:

- Bootstrap Kibana
  ```
  yarn kbn bootstrap
  ```
- Start Elasticsearch in one shell
  ```
  yarn es snapshot -E xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled=true
  ```
- Start Kibana in another shell
  ```
  yarn start --xpack.ingestManager.enabled=true --no-base-path
  ```

This plugin follows the `common`, `server`, `public` structure from the [Architecture Style Guide
](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/style_guides/architecture_style_guide.md#file-and-folder-structure). We also follow the pattern of developing feature branches under your personal fork of Kibana.

### API Tests

#### Ingest & Fleet

1. In one terminal, change to the `x-pack` directory and start the test server with

   ```
   node scripts/functional_tests_server.js --config test/api_integration/config.js
   ```

1. in a second terminal, run the tests from the Kibana root directory with
   ```
   node scripts/functional_test_runner.js --config x-pack/test/api_integration/config.js
   ```

#### EPM

1. In one terminal, change to the `x-pack` directory and start the test server with

   ```
   node scripts/functional_tests_server.js --config test/epm_api_integration/config.ts
   ```

1. in a second terminal, run the tests from the Kibana root directory with
   ```
   node scripts/functional_test_runner.js --config x-pack/test/epm_api_integration/config.ts
   ```

### Staying up-to-date with `master`

While we're developing in the `feature-ingest` feature branch, here's is more information on keeping up to date with upstream kibana.

<details>
  <summary>merge upstream <code>master</code> into <code>feature-ingest</code></summary>

```bash
## checkout feature branch to your fork
git checkout -B feature-ingest origin/feature-ingest

## make sure your feature branch is current with upstream feature branch
git pull upstream feature-ingest

## pull in changes from upstream master
git pull upstream master

## push changes to your remote
git push origin

# /!\ Open a DRAFT PR /!\
# Normal PRs will re-notify authors of commits already merged
# Draft PR will trigger CI run. Once CI is green ...
# /!\ DO NOT USE THE GITHUB UI TO MERGE THE PR /!\

## push your changes to upstream feature branch from the terminal; not GitHub UI
git push upstream
```

</details>

See https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/37950 for an example.
