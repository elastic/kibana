// When you have a flex item with an EuiSwitch and replace it with
// an EuiLoadingSpinner you end up with a slight 2px difference between
// them. With this selector we offset the difference so that the content
// of the page doesnt jump when toggling between states.
.upgToggleLoading > .upgLoadingItem {
  margin: $euiSizeM / 2;
