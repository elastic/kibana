To get deeper information about the behavior of the stack monitoring application you can configure APM to send trace data an APM server.

The kibana source references a central APM server for use by anyone working at Elastic, or you can send trace data to an APM server you manage yourself.

## For local development

Elasticians are able to send data to a central APM server and kibana instance by exporting the following environment variables:

```shell
export ELASTIC_APM_ACTIVE=true
export ELASTIC_APM_ENVIRONMENT="dev-${USER}"
```

All data will be available on the shared APM cluster. See (internal) https://docs.elastic.dev/kibana-team/data-and-dashboards#kibana-cloud-apm for access information.

## For ESS

ESS clusters in the Elastic organization are configured to send data to the cloud overview cluster automatically (via the cloud `KibanaInternalApmSettings` class). Search for `label.deploymentId: <your deployment ID>` in a kibana dashboard or APM UI.

For clusters outside the Elastic organization, or to send APM data to a different deployment, you can add the APM settings into the `user_settings_override_yaml` deployment configuration within `kibana.plan.kibana` section as escaped YAML inside JSON.

For example:

```json
{
  "user_settings_override_yaml": "elastic.apm.active: true\nelastic.apm.serverUrl: https://<my_apm_endpoint>\nelastic.apm.secretToken: <my_APM_token>\nelastic.apm.globalLabels.deploymentId: <my_deployment_ID>\nelastic.apm.centralConfig: false\nelastic.apm.breakdownMetrics: false\nelastic.apm.transactionSampleRate: 0.1\nelastic.apm.metricsInterval: 120s\nelastic.apm.captureSpanStackTraces: false"
}
```

This is an administrative-only API currently, so you'll need admin access or open a support case to have it configured.

## For ECE or other deployments

For on-premise deployments or developers outside Elastic, you can configure an APM endpoint via `kibana.yml`. Note that at the time of writing this document you can't use `kibana.dev.yml` for these settings due to library load order.

```yaml
elastic.apm.active: true
elastic.apm.serverUrl: https://<my_apm_endpoint>
elastic.apm.secretToken: <my_APM_token>
elastic.apm.globalLabels.deploymentId: <my_deployment_ID>
elastic.apm.centralConfig: false
elastic.apm.breakdownMetrics: false
elastic.apm.transactionSampleRate: 0.1
elastic.apm.metricsInterval: 120s
elastic.apm.captureSpanStackTraces: false
```

When running in ECE you can update `kibana.yml` settings via the ECE web UI under "Edit user setting" for the kibana nodes in the deployment.
