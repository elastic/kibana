# Ingest Node Pipelines UI

## Summary
The `ingest_pipelines` plugin provides Kibana support for [Elasticsearch's ingest nodes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ingest.html). Please refer to the Elasticsearch documentation for more details.

This plugin allows Kibana to create, edit, clone and delete ingest node pipelines. It also provides support to simulate a pipeline.

It requires a Basic license and the following cluster privileges: `manage_pipeline` and `cluster:monitor/nodes/info`.

## Development

A new app called Ingest Node Pipelines is registered in the Management section and follows a typical CRUD UI pattern. The client-side portion of this app lives in [public/application](public/application) and uses endpoints registered in [server/routes/api](server/routes/api). For more information on the pipeline processors editor component, check out the [component readme](public/application/components/pipeline_processors_editor/README.md).

See the [kibana contributing guide](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on setting up your development environment.

### Test coverage

The app has the following test coverage:

- API integration tests
- Smoke-level functional test
- Client-integration tests

### Quick steps for manual testing

You can run the following request in Console to create an ingest node pipeline:

```
PUT _ingest/pipeline/test_pipeline
{
   "description": "_description",
    "processors": [
      {
        "set": {
          "field": "field1",
          "value": "value1"
        }
      },
      {
        "rename": {
          "field": "dont_exist",
          "target_field": "field1",
          "ignore_failure": true
        }
      },
      {
        "rename": {
          "field": "foofield",
          "target_field": "new_field",
          "on_failure": [
            {
              "set": {
                "field": "field2",
                "value": "value2"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "drop": {
          "if": "false"
        }
      },
      {
        "drop": {
          "if": "true"
        }
      }
    ]
}
```

Then, go to the Ingest Node Pipelines UI to edit, delete, clone, or view details of the pipeline.

To simulate a pipeline, go to the "Edit" page of your pipeline. Click the "Add documents" link under the "Processors" section. You may add the following sample documents to test the pipeline: 

```
// The first document in this example should trigger the on_failure processor in the pipeline, while the second one should succeed.
[
  {
    "_index": "my_index",
    "_id": "id1",
    "_source": {
      "foo": "bar"
    }
  },
  {
    "_index": "my_index",
    "_id": "id2",
    "_source": {
      "foo": "baz",
      "foofield": "bar"
    }
  }
]
```

Alternatively, you can add a document from an existing index, or create some sample data of your own. Afterward, click the "Run the pipeline" button to view the output.
