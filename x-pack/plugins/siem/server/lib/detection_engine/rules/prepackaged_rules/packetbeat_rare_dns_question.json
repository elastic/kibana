  "description": "A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual DNS query that indicate network activity with unusual DNS domains. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from an uncommon domain. When malware is already running, it may send requests to an uncommon DNS domain the malware uses for command-and-control communication.",

    "A newly installed program or one that runs rarely as part of a monthly or quarterly workflow could trigger this signal. Network activity that occurs rarely, in small quantities, can trigger this signal. Possible examples are browsing technical support or vendor networks sparsely. A user who visits a new or unique web destination may trigger this signal."
