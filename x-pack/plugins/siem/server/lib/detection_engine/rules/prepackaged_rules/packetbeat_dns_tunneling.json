  "description": "A machine learning job detected unusually large numbers of DNS queries for a single top-level DNS domain, which is often used for DNS tunneling. DNS tunneling can be used for command-and-control, persistence, or data exfiltration activity. For example, dnscat tends to generate many DNS questions for a top-level domain as it uses the DNS protocol to tunnel data.",

    "DNS domains that use large numbers of child domains, such as software or content distribution networks, can trigger this signal and such parent domains can be excluded."
