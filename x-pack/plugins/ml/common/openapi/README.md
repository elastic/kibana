# OpenAPI (Experimental)

The current self-contained spec file can be used for online tools like those found at https://openapi.tools/. This spec is experimental and may be incomplete or change later.

A guide about the openApi specification can be found at [https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/).

These files are joined with the rest of the Kibana APIs per `oas_docs/README.md`
