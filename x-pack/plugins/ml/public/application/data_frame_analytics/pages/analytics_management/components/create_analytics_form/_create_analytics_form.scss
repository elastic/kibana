/*
 The job creation form displayed in the modal adapts its height dynamically
 if the content changes. If a form element changes to show/hide error messages,
 this results in a changing height of the modal. If you type quickly e.g.
 in the job ID input field and type chars which are invalid only for example
 at the end of the string, this will result in an unwanted height toggling
 effect. The following CSS avoids this by 1) delaying the visilibity of the
 error message by 500ms and 2) animating the height and opacity to create
 a fade-in effect after that so the modal grows smoothly and doesn't
 toggle its height.
