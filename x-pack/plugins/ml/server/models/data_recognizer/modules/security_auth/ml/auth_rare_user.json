An unusual user name is one way of detecting credentialed access by means of a new or dormant user account. A user account that is normally inactive, because the user has left the organization, which becomes active, may be due to credentialed access using a compromised account password. Threat actors will sometimes also create new users as a means of persisting in a compromised web application.",
