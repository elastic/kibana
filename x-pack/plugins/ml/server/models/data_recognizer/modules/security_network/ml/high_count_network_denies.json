  "description": "Security: Network - looks for an unusually large spike in network traffic that was denied by network ACLs or firewall rules. Such a burst of denied traffic is usually either 1) a misconfigured application or firewall or 2) suspicious or malicious activity. Unsuccessful attempts at network transit, in order to connect to command-and-control (C2), or engage in data exfiltration, may produce a burst of failed connections. This could also be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic.  Denial-of-service attacks or traffic floods may also produce such a surge in traffic.",
