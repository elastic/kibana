# Generating event schema

The files in this directory were generated by manually running the script
`../scripts/create_schemas.js` from the root directory of the repository.

**These files should not be edited by hand.**

Please follow the following steps:

1. Clone the [ECS](https://github.com/elastic/ecs) repo locally so that it
  resides along side your kibana repo, and checkout the ECS version you wish to
  support (for example, the `1.8` branch, for version 1.8).

2. In the `x-pack/plugins/event_log/scripts/mappings.js` file you'll want to
  make the following changes:
    - Update `EcsCustomPropertyMappings` to include the mapping of the custom
      fields you wish to add.
    - Update `EcsPropertiesToGenerate` to include the fields in the generated
      `mappings.json`.
    - Make sure to list all array fields in `EcsEventLogMultiValuedProperties`.

3. Cd to the `kibana` root folder and run:

    ```sh
    node ./x-pack/plugins/event_log/scripts/create_schemas.js
    ```
