# The `data` plugin and `SearchStrategies`

The search functionality abstraction provided by the `search` service of the
`data` plugin is pretty powerful:

- The execution of the request is delegated to a search strategy, which is
    executed on the Kibana server side.
- Any plugin can register custom search strategies with custom parameters and
    response shapes.
- Search requests can be cancelled via an `AbortSignal`.
- Search requests are decoupled from the transport layer. The service will poll
    for new results transparently.
- Partial responses can be returned as they become available if the search
    takes longer.

# Working with `data.search.search()` in the Browser

The following chapters describe a set of React components and hooks that aim to
make it easy to take advantage of these characteristics from client-side React
code. They implement a producer/consumer pattern that decouples the craeation
of search requests from the consumption of the responses. This keeps each
code-path small and encourages the use of reactive processing, which in turn
reduces the risk of race conditions and incorrect assumptions about the
response timing.

## Issuing new requests

The main API to issue new requests is the `data.search.search()` function. It
returns an `Observable` representing the stream of partial and final results
without the consumer having to know the underlying transport mechanisms.
Besides receiving a search-strategy-specific parameter object, it supports
selection of the search strategy as well an `AbortSignal` used for request
cancellation.

The hook `useDataSearch()` is designed to ease the integration between the
`Observable` world and the React world. It uses the function it is given to
derive the parameters to use for the next search request. The request can then
be issued by calling the returned `search()` function. For each new request the
hook emits an object describing the request and its state in the `requests$`
`Observable`.

Since the specific response shape depends on the data strategy used, the hook
takes a projection function, that is responsible for decoding the response in
an appropriate way. Because most response projections follow a similar pattern
there's a helper `normalizeDataSearchResponses(initialResponse,
parseRawResponse)`, which generates an RxJS operator, that...

- emits an initial response containing the given `initialResponse` value
- applies `parseRawResponse` to the `rawResponse` property of each emitted response
- transforms transport layer errors as well as parsing errors into
  `SearchStrategyError`s

```typescript
const parseMyCustomSearchResponse = normalizeDataSearchResponses(
  'initial value',
  decodeOrThrow(myCustomSearchResponsePayloadRT)
);

const { search, requests$ } = useDataSearch({
  getRequest: useCallback((searchTerm: string) => ({
    request: {
      params: {
        searchTerm
      },
      options: {
        strategy: 'my-custom-search-strategy',
      },
    },
  }), []),
  parseResponses: parseMyCustomSearchResponse,
});
```

## Executing requests and consuming the responses

The response `Observable`s emitted by `data.search.search()` is "cold", so it
won't be executed unless a subscriber subscribes to it. And in order to cleanly
cancel and garbage collect the subscription it should be integrated with the
React component life-cycle.

The `useLatestPartialDataSearchResponse()` does that in such a way that the
newest response observable is subscribed to and that any previous response
observables are unsubscribed from for proper cancellation if a new request has
been created. This uses RxJS's `switchMap()` operator under the hood. The hook
also makes sure that all observables are unsubscribed from on unmount.

A request can fail due to various reasons that include servers-side errors,
Elasticsearch shard failures and network failures. The intention is to map all
of them to a common `SearchStrategyError` interface. While the
`useLatestPartialDataSearchResponse()` hook does that for errors emitted
natively by the response `Observable`, it's the responsibility of the
projection function to handle errors that are encoded in the response body,
which includes most server-side errors. Note that errors and partial results in
a response are not mutually exclusive.

The request status (running, partial, etc), the response
and the errors are turned in to React component state so they can be used in
the usual rendering cycle:

```typescript
const {
  cancelRequest,
  isRequestRunning,
  isResponsePartial,
  latestResponseData,
  latestResponseErrors,
  loaded,
  total,
} = useLatestPartialDataSearchResponse(requests$);
```

## Representing the request state to the user

After the values have been made available to the React rendering process using
the `useLatestPartialDataSearchResponse()` hook, normal component hierarchies
can be used to make the request state and result available to the user. The
following utility components can make that even easier.

### Undetermined progress

If `total` and `loaded` are not (yet) known, we can show an undetermined
progress bar.

  <Story id="infra-datasearch-datasearchprogress--undetermined-progress" />
</Canvas>

### Known progress

If `total` and `loaded` are returned by the search strategy, they can be used
to show a progress bar with the option to cancel the request if it takes too
long.

  <Story id="infra-datasearch-datasearchprogress--cancelable-determined-progress" />
</Canvas>

### Failed requests

Assuming the errors are represented as an array of `SearchStrategyError`s in
the `latestResponseErrors` return value, they can be rendered as appropriate
for the respective part of the UI. For many cases a `EuiCallout` is suitable,
so the `DataSearchErrorCallout` can serve as a starting point:
