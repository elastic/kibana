  summary: Get the rule types
  operationId: getRuleTypes
  description: >
    If you have `read` privileges for one or more Kibana features, the API
    response contains information about the appropriate rule types. For example,
    there are rule types associated with the **Management > Stack Rules** feature,
    **Analytics > Discover** and **Machine Learning** features, **Observability**
    features, and **Security** features. To get rule types associated with the
    **Stack Monitoring** feature, use the `monitoring_user` built-in role.
