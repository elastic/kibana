  summary: Updates the attributes for a rule.
  operationId: updateRule
  description: >
    You must have `all` privileges for the appropriate Kibana features,
    depending on the `consumer` and `rule_type_id` of the rule you're updating.
    For example, you must have privileges for the **Management > Stack rules**
    feature, **Analytics > Discover** and **Machine Learning** features,
    **Observability** features, or **Security** features.  If the rule has
    actions, you must also have `read` privileges for the
    **Management > Actions and Connectors** feature. NOTE: This API supports
    only token-based authentication. When you update a rule, it identifies which
    roles you have at that point in time. Thereafter, when the rule performs
    queries, it uses those security privileges. If you have different privileges
    than the user that created or most recently updated the rule, you might
    change its behavior. Though some properties are optional, when you update
    the rule the existing property values are overwritten with default values.
    Therefore, it is recommended to explicitly set all property values.
