    You must have `all` privileges for the appropriate Kibana features,
    depending on the `consumer` and `rule_type_id` of the rule. For example, the
    **Management > Stack Rules** feature, **Analytics > Discover** and
    **Machine Learning** features, **Observability**, and **Security** features.
    If the rule has actions, you must also have `read` privileges for the
    **Management > Actions and Connectors** feature.
