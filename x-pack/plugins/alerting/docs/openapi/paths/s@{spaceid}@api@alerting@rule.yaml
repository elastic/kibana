  summary: Creates a rule with a randomly generated rule identifier.
  operationId: createRule
  description: >
    You must have `all` privileges for the appropriate Kibana features, depending on the `consumer` and `rule_type_id` of the rule you're creating.
    For example, you must have privileges for the **Management > Stack rules** feature, **Analytics > Discover** and **Machine Learning** features, **Observability** features, or **Security** features.
    If the rule has actions, you must also have `read` privileges for the **Management > Actions and Connectors** feature.
    NOTE: This API supports only token-based authentication.
    When you create a rule, it identifies which roles you have at that point in time.
    Thereafter, when the rule performs queries, it uses those security privileges.
    If a user with different privileges updates the rule, its behavior might change.
