        Conditions that affect whether the action runs.
        If you specify multiple conditions, all conditions must be met for the action to run.
        For example, if an alert occurs within the specified time frame and matches the query, the action runs.

        The properties that affect how often actions are generated.
        If the rule type supports setting `summary` to `true`, the action can be a summary of alerts at the specified notification interval.
        Otherwise, an action runs for each alert at the specified notification interval.
        NOTE: You cannot specify these parameters when `notify_when` or `throttle` are defined at the rule level.
      required:
        - notify_when
        - summary
      properties:
        notify_when:
          $ref: 'notify_when.yaml'

      description: >
        The group name, which affects when the action runs (for example, when the threshold is met or when the alert is recovered).
        Each rule type has a list of valid action group names.
        If you don't need to group actions, set to `default`.
