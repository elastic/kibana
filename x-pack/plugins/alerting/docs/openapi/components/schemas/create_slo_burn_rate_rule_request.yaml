title: Create slo burn rate rule request
description: >
  A rule that detects when the burn rate is above a defined threshold for two different lookback periods.
  The two periods are a long period and a short period that is 1/12th of the long period.
  For each lookback period, the burn rate is computed as the error rate divided by the error budget.
  When the burn rates for both periods surpass the threshold, an alert occurs.
