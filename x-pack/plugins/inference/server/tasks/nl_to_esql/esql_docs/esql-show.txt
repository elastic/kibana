## SHOW

The `SHOW` source command returns information about the deployment and its capabilities. This command is useful for retrieving metadata about the Elasticsearch deployment, such as the version, build date, and hash. It is particularly helpful for administrators and developers who need to verify the deployment details or troubleshoot issues. The `SHOW` command has a limitation in that it can only be used with the `INFO` item.

### Examples

Here are some example ES|QL queries using the `SHOW` command:

1. Retrieve the deploymentâ€™s version, build date, and hash:
    ```esql
SHOW INFO
```

2. Use the `SHOW` command in a multi-line query for better readability:
    ```esql
SHOW INFO
```

3. Another example of using the `SHOW` command to get deployment information:
    ```esql
SHOW INFO
```

These examples demonstrate the primary usage of the `SHOW` command to retrieve deployment information.
