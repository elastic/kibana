## SORT

The `SORT` processing command in ES|QL is used to sort a table based on one or more columns. This command is essential for organizing data in a specific order, which can be particularly useful for reporting, data analysis, and visualization. The default sort order is ascending, but you can specify descending order using `DESC`. Additionally, you can handle null values explicitly by using `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`.

### Use Cases
- **Organizing Data**: Sort data to make it easier to read and analyze.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports where data needs to be presented in a specific order.
- **Data Analysis**: Facilitate data analysis by sorting data based on key metrics.
- **Visualization**: Prepare data for visualizations that require sorted input.

### Limitations
- **Multivalued Columns**: When sorting on multivalued columns, the lowest value is used for ascending order and the highest value for descending order.
- **Null Values**: By default, null values are treated as larger than any other value. This can be changed using `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`.

### Examples

#### Basic Sorting
Sort the `employees` table by the `height` column in ascending order:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height
```

#### Explicit Ascending Order
Sort the `employees` table by the `height` column in descending order:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC
```

#### Multiple Sort Expressions
Sort the `employees` table by the `height` column in descending order and use `first_name` as a tie breaker in ascending order:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC, first_name ASC
```

#### Sorting Null Values First
Sort the `employees` table by the `first_name` column in ascending order, placing null values first:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT first_name ASC NULLS FIRST
```

These examples demonstrate the versatility of the `SORT` command in organizing data for various analytical and reporting needs.
