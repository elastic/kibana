# SORT

The SORT command is used to arrange a table based on one or more columns.

## Syntax

`SORT column1 [ASC/DESC][NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST][, ..., columnN [ASC/DESC][NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST]]`

### Parameters

#### columnX

The column on which the sorting is to be performed.

## Examples

Sort a table based on the 'height' column:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height
```

Explicitly sort in ascending order with `ASC`:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC
```

Provide additional sort expressions to act as tie breakers:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT height DESC, first_name ASC
```

Sort `null` values first using `NULLS FIRST`:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| SORT first_name ASC NULLS FIRST
```

### Notes

By default, the sorting order is ascending. You can specify an explicit sort order by using `ASC` for ascending or `DESC` for descending.

If two rows have the same sort key, they are considered equal. You can provide additional sort expressions to act as tie breakers.

When sorting on multivalued columns, the lowest value is used when sorting in ascending order and the highest value is used when sorting in descending order.

By default, `null` values are treated as being larger than any other value. This means that with an ascending sort order, `null` values are sorted last, and with a descending sort order, `null` values are sorted first. You can change this by providing `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`.


### Limitations
- **Multivalued Columns**: When sorting on multivalued columns, the lowest value is used for ascending order and the highest value for descending order.
- **Null Values**: By default, null values are treated as larger than any other value. This can be changed using `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`.
