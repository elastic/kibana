## SUBSTRING

The `SUBSTRING` function returns a substring of a string, specified by a start position and an optional length.

### Syntax

`SUBSTRING(string, start, [length])`

### Parameters

- `string`: String expression. If null, the function returns null.
- `start`: Start position.
- `length`: Length of the substring from the start position. Optional; if omitted, all positions after start are returned.

### Examples

This example returns the first three characters of every last name:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP last_name
| EVAL ln_sub = SUBSTRING(last_name, 1, 3)
```

A negative start position is interpreted as being relative to the end of the string. This example returns the last three characters of every last name:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP last_name
| EVAL ln_sub = SUBSTRING(last_name, -3, 3)
```

If length is omitted, `SUBSTRING` returns the remainder of the string. This example returns all characters except for the first:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP last_name
| EVAL ln_sub = SUBSTRING(last_name, 2)
```
