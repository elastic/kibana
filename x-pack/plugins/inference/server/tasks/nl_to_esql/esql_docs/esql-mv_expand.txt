# MV_EXPAND

The MV_EXPAND command is used to expand multivalued columns into individual rows, replicating the other columns for each new row.

## Syntax

`MV_EXPAND column`

### Parameters

#### column

This is the multivalued column that you want to expand.

## Examples

Expanding a multivalued column `a` into individual rows:

```esql
ROW a=[1,2,3], b="b", j=["a","b"]
| MV_EXPAND a
```

Expanding two multivalued columns `a` and `j` into individual rows:

```esql
ROW a=[1,2,3], b="b", j=["a","b"]
| MV_EXPAND a
| MV_EXPAND j
```

Expanding a multivalued column and then filtering the results:

```esql
ROW a=[1,2,3,4,5], b="b"
| MV_EXPAND a
| WHERE a > 2
```
