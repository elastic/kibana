## TO_INTEGER

Converts an input value to an integer value. If the input parameter is of a date type, its value will be interpreted as milliseconds since the Unix epoch, converted to integer. Boolean true will be converted to integer 1, false to 0.

### Examples

```esql
ROW long = [5013792, 2147483647, 501379200000]
| EVAL int = TO_INTEGER(long)
```

Note that in this example, the last value of the multi-valued field cannot be converted as an integer. When this happens, the result is a null value. In this case, a Warning header is added to the response. The header will provide information on the source of the failure: "Line 1:61: evaluation of [TO_INTEGER(long)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded." A following header will contain the failure reason and the offending value: "org.elasticsearch.xpack.esql.core.InvalidArgumentException: [501379200000] out of [integer] range"
