## MV_ZIP

The `MV_ZIP` function combines the values from two multivalued fields with a delimiter that joins them together.

### Examples

```esql
ROW a = ["x", "y", "z"], b = ["1", "2"]
| EVAL c = mv_zip(a, b, "-")
| KEEP a, b, c
```

```esql
ROW names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], ids = ["001", "002", "003"]
| EVAL combined = mv_zip(names, ids, ":")
| KEEP names, ids, combined
```
