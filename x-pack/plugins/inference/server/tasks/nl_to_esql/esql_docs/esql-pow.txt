## POW

The `POW` function returns the value of a base raised to the power of an exponent. It is still possible to overflow a double result here; in that case, null will be returned.

### Examples

```esql
ROW base = 2.0, exponent = 2
| EVAL result = POW(base, exponent)
```

```esql
ROW base = 4, exponent = 0.5
| EVAL s = POW(base, exponent)
```
