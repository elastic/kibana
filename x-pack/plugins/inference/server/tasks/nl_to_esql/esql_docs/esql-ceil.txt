## CEIL

The `CEIL` function rounds a number up to the nearest integer. This operation is a no-op for long (including unsigned) and integer types. For double types, it picks the closest double value to the integer, similar to `Math.ceil`.

### Examples

```esql
ROW a=1.8
| EVAL a = CEIL(a)
```

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height_ceil = CEIL(height)
```
