## COUNT

The `COUNT` function returns the total number (count) of input values. If the `field` parameter is omitted, it is equivalent to `COUNT(*)`, which counts the number of rows.

### Examples

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS COUNT(height)
```

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS count = COUNT(*) BY languages
| SORT languages DESC
```

```esql
ROW words="foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;foo"
| STATS word_count = COUNT(SPLIT(words, ";"))
```

```esql
ROW n=1
| WHERE n < 0
| STATS COUNT(n)
```

```esql
ROW n=1
| STATS COUNT(n > 0 OR NULL), COUNT(n < 0 OR NULL)
```
