## ATAN2

The `ATAN2` function calculates the angle between the positive x-axis and the ray from the origin to the point (x, y) in the Cartesian plane, expressed in radians.

### Examples

```esql
ROW y=12.9, x=.6
| EVAL atan2 = ATAN2(y, x)
```

```esql
ROW y=5.0, x=3.0
| EVAL atan2 = ATAN2(y, x)
```
