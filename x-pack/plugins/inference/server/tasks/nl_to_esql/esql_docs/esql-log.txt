## LOG

The `LOG` function returns the logarithm of a value to a specified base. The input can be any numeric value, and the return value is always a double. Logs of zero, negative numbers, and base of one return null as well as a warning.

### Examples

```esql
ROW base = 2.0, value = 8.0
| EVAL s = LOG(base, value)
```

```esql
ROW value = 100
| EVAL s = LOG(value)
```
