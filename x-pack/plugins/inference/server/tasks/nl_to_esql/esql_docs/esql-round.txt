## ROUND

The `ROUND` function rounds a number to the specified number of decimal places. By default, it rounds to 0 decimal places, which returns the nearest integer. If the precision is a negative number, it rounds to the number of digits left of the decimal point. If the input value is null, the function returns null.

### Examples

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height_ft = ROUND(height * 3.281, 1)
```

```esql
FROM sales
| KEEP product_name, revenue
| EVAL rounded_revenue = ROUND(revenue, -2)
```
