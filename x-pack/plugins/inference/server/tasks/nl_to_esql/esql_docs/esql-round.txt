# ROUND

The ROUND function rounds a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places.

## Syntax

`ROUND(number, decimals)`

### Parameters

#### number

The numeric value to be rounded.

#### decimals

The number of decimal places to which the number should be rounded. The default value is 0.

## Examples

The following example rounds the height of employees to one decimal place after converting it from meters to feet:

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height_ft = ROUND(height * 3.281, 1)
```

```esql
FROM sales
| KEEP product_name, revenue
| EVAL rounded_revenue = ROUND(revenue, -2)
```

## Notes

If "decimals" is a negative number, the ROUND function rounds to the number of digits left of the decimal point.
