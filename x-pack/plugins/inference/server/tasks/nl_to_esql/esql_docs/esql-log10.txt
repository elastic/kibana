## LOG10

The `LOG10` function returns the logarithm of a value to base 10. The input can be any numeric value, and the return value is always a double. Logs of 0 and negative numbers return null as well as a warning.

### Examples

```esql
ROW d = 1000.0
| EVAL s = LOG10(d)
```

```esql
ROW value = 100
| EVAL log_value = LOG10(value)
```
