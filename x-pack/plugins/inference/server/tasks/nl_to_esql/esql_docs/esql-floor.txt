## FLOOR

The `FLOOR` function rounds a number down to the nearest integer. This operation is a no-op for long (including unsigned) and integer types. For double types, it picks the closest double value to the integer, similar to `Math.floor`.

### Examples

```esql
ROW a=1.8
| EVAL a = FLOOR(a)
```

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height_floor = FLOOR(height)
```
