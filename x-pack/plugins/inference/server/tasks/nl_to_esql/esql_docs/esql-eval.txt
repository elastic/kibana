# EVAL

The EVAL command allows you to append new columns with calculated values to your data.

## Syntax

`EVAL [column1 =] value1[, ..., [columnN =] valueN]`

### Parameters

#### {columnX}

This is the name of the column. If a column with the same name already exists, it will be replaced. If a column name is used more than once, only the rightmost duplicate will create a column.

#### {valueX}

This is the value for the column. It can be a literal, an expression, or a function. Columns defined to the left of this one can be used.

## Examples

The following example multiplies the `height` column by 3.281 and 100 to create new columns `height_feet` and `height_cm`:

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height_feet = height * 3.281, height_cm = height * 100
```

If the specified column already exists, the existing column will be replaced, and the new column will be appended to the table:

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height = height * 3.281
```

Specifying the output column name is optional. If not specified, the new column name is equal to the expression. The following query adds a column named `height*3.281`:

```esql
FROM employees
| SORT emp_no
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height * 3.281
```

Because this name contains special characters, it needs to be quoted with backticks (`) when using it in subsequent commands:

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL height * 3.281
| STATS avg_height_feet = AVG(`height * 3.281`)
```

### Limitations
- If a column with the same name already exists, the existing column is dropped.
- If a column name is used more than once, only the rightmost duplicate creates a column.
