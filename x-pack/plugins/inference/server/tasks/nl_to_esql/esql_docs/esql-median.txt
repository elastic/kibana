## MEDIAN

The `MEDIAN` function returns the value that is greater than half of all values and less than half of all values, also known as the 50% PERCENTILE. Like `PERCENTILE`, `MEDIAN` is usually approximate. It is also non-deterministic, meaning you can get slightly different results using the same data.

### Examples

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
```

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS median_max_salary_change = MEDIAN(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```
