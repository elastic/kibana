## SQRT

The `SQRT` function returns the square root of a number. The input can be any numeric value, and the return value is always a double. Square roots of negative numbers and infinities are null.

### Examples

```esql
ROW d = 100.0
| EVAL s = SQRT(d)
```

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL sqrt_height = SQRT(height)
```
