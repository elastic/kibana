## MV_FIRST

The `MV_FIRST` function converts a multivalued expression into a single-valued column containing the first value. This is most useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued columns in a known order like `SPLIT`. The order that multivalued fields are read from underlying storage is not guaranteed. It is frequently ascending, but don’t rely on that. If you need the minimum value, use `MV_MIN` instead of `MV_FIRST`. `MV_MIN` has optimizations for sorted values so there isn’t a performance benefit to `MV_FIRST`.

### Examples

```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL first_a = MV_FIRST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```

```esql
ROW b="apple;banana;cherry"
| EVAL first_b = MV_FIRST(SPLIT(b, ";"))
```
