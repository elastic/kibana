# DROP

The DROP command is used to eliminate one or more columns from the data.

## Syntax

`DROP columns`

### Parameters

#### columns

This is a list of columns, separated by commas, that you want to remove. Wildcards are supported.

## Examples

In the following example, the 'height' column is removed from the data:

```esql
FROM employees
| DROP height
```

You can also use wildcards to remove all columns that match a certain pattern. In the following example, all columns that start with 'height' are removed:

```esql
FROM employees
| DROP height*
```

This example demonstrates how to drop multiple specific columns by listing them in a comma-separated format.

```esql
FROM employees
| DROP height, weight, age
```

This example shows how to drop columns that match a more complex pattern using wildcards.

```esql
FROM employees
| DROP emp_*
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `DROP` command in conjunction with other commands like `KEEP` and `SORT`.

```esql
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height, weight
| DROP weight
| SORT height DESC
```

### Limitations
- The `DROP` command does not support nested fields.
- It cannot be used to drop columns of unsupported types as specified in the ES|QL limitations.
