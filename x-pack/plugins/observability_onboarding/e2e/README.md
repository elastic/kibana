# Observability onboarding E2E tests

Observability onboarding uses [FTR](../../../../packages/kbn-test/README.mdx) (functional test runner) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to run the e2e tests. The tests are located at `kibana/x-pack/plugins/observability_onboarding/e2e/cypress/e2e`.

## E2E Tests (Cypress)

The E2E tests are located in [`x-pack/plugins/observability_onboarding/e2e`](./cypress/e2e).

Tests run on buildkite PR pipeline are parallelized (2 parallel jobs) and are orchestrated by the Cypress dashboard service. It can be configured in [.buildkite/pipelines/pull_request/observability_onboarding_cypress.yml](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/.buildkite/pipelines/pull_request/observability_onboarding_cypress.yml) with the property `parallelism`.

```yml
    ...
    depends_on: build
    parallelism: 2
    ...
```
