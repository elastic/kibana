==== `RLIKE`

Use `RLIKE` to filter data based on string patterns using using
<<regexp-syntax,regular expressions>>. `RLIKE` usually acts on a field placed on
the left-hand side of the operator, but it can also act on a constant (literal)
expression. The right-hand side of the operator represents the pattern.
