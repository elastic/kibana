When we [announced](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/2022-elastic-global-threat-report-announcement) the inaugural Elastic Global Threat Report last year, the Elastic Security Labs team knew we wanted to follow it with a series that went a little deeper on several topics like trends and forecasting. Not only would this allow us to keep the report concise, but it would provide us with a way to be more transparent by diving deep.

This post will be updated with each new article in the series, published monthly:

- [Topic: Defense Evasion](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-global-threat-report-breakdown-defense-evasion)
- [Topic: Credential Access](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-global-threat-report-breakdown-credential-access)

In April, we published an [updated](https://ela.st/gtr) version of the Global Threat Report Spring Edition which included new insights online and interactive.
