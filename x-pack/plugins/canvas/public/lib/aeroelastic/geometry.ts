// index (Y) and middle finger (Z) on the left hand such that they're all perpendicular to one another, and point to the
// positive direction.
//
// If it were a right handed coordinate system, AND Y still pointed down, then Z should increase away from the
// viewer. But that's not the case. So we maximize the Z value to tell what's on top.
