/*
  Type checking isn't too useful if future commits can accidentally weaken the type constraints, because a
  TypeScript linter will not complain - everything that passed before will continue to pass. The coder
  will not have feedback that the original intent with the typing got compromised. To declare the intent
  via passing and failing type checks, test cases are needed, some of which designed to expect a TS pass,
  some of them to expect a TS complaint. It documents intent for peers too, as type specs are a tough read.

  Test "cases" expecting to pass TS checks are not annotated, while ones we want TS to complain about
  are prepended with the comment

  // @ts-expect-error

  The test "suite" and "cases" are wrapped in IIFEs to prevent linters from complaining about the unused
  binding. It can be structured internally as desired.
