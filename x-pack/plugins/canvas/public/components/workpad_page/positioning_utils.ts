/**
 * elementToShape
 *
 * converts a `kibana-canvas` element to an `aeroelastic` shape.
 *
 * Shape: the layout algorithms need to deal with objects through their geometric properties, excluding other aspects,
 * such as what's inside the element, eg. image or scatter plot. This representation is, at its core, a transform matrix
 * that establishes a new local coordinate system https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#local-coordinate-system plus a
 * size descriptor. There are two versions of the transform matrix:
 *   - `transformMatrix` is analogous to the SVG https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#current-transformation-matrix
 *   - `localTransformMatrix` is analogous to the SVG https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#transformation-matrix
 *
 * Element: it also needs to represent the geometry, primarily because of the need to persist it in `redux` and on the
 * server, and to accept such data from the server. The redux and server representations will need to change as more general
 * projections such as 3D are added. The element also needs to maintain its content, such as an image or a plot.
 *
 * While all elements on the current page also exist as shapes, there are shapes that are not elements: annotations.
 * For example, `rotation_handle`, `border_resize_handle` and `border_connection` are modeled as shapes by the layout
 * library, simply for generality.
