/**
 * Some authentication providers need to know current user URL to, for example, restore it after a
 * complex authentication handshake. But most of the Kibana URLs include hash fragment that is never
 * sent to the server. To capture that authentication provider can redirect user to this app putting
 * path segment into the `next` query string parameter (so that it's not lost during redirect). And
 * since browsers preserve hash fragments during redirects (assuming redirect location doesn't
 * specify its own hash fragment, which is true in our case) this app can capture both path and
 * hash URL segments and re-try request sending hash fragment in a dedicated query string parameter.
 *
 * The flow can look like this:
 * 1. User visits `https://kibana.com/app/kibana#/management/elasticsearch` that initiates authentication.
 * 2. Provider redirect user to `/internal/security/capture-url?next=%2Fapp%2Fkibana&auth_provider_hint=saml1`.
 * 3. Browser preserves hash segment and users ends up at `/internal/security/capture-url?next=%2Fapp%2Fkibana&auth_provider_hint=saml1#/management/elasticsearch`.
 * 4. The app reconstructs original URL, adds `auth_url_hash` query string parameter with the captured hash fragment and redirects user to:
 *    https://kibana.com/app/kibana?auth_provider_hint=saml1&auth_url_hash=%23%2Fmanagement%2Felasticsearch#/management/elasticsearch
 * 5. Once Kibana receives this request, it immediately picks exactly the same provider to handle authentication (based on `auth_provider_hint=saml1`),
 *    and, since it has full URL now (original request path, query string and hash extracted from `auth_url_hash=%23%2Fmanagement%2Felasticsearch`),
 *    it can proceed to a proper authentication handshake.
