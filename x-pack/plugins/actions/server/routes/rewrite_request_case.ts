/**
 * This type maps Camel Case strings into their Snake Case version.
 * This is achieved by checking each character and, if it is an uppercase character, it is mapped to an
 * underscore followed by a lowercase one.
 *
 * The reason there are two ternaries is that, for perfformance reasons, TS limits its
 * character parsing to ~15 characters.
 * To get around this we use the second turnery to parse 2 characters at a time, which allows us to support
 * strings that are 30 characters long.
 *
 * If you get the TS #2589 error ("Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite") then most
 * likely you have a string that's longer than 30 characters.
 * Address this by reducing the length if possible, otherwise, you'll need to add a 3rd ternary which
 * parses 3 chars at a time :grimace:
 *
 * For more details see this PR comment: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/40336#issuecomment-686723087
