    enum:
      - certificate
      - full
      - none
    default: full
    description: >
      Controls the verification of certificates.
      Use `full` to validate that the certificate has an issue date within the `not_before` and `not_after` dates, chains to a trusted certificate authority (CA), and has a hostname or IP address that matches the names within the certificate.
      Use `certificate` to validate the certificate and verify that it is signed by a trusted authority; this option does not check the certificate hostname.
      Use `none` to skip certificate validation.
