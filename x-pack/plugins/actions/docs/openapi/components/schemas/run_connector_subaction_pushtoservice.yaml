            description: >
              The correlation identifier for the security incident for ServiceNow ITSM and ServiveNow SecOps connectors. Connectors using the same correlation ID are associated with the same ServiceNow incident. This value determines whether a new ServiceNow incident is created or an existing one is updated. Modifying this value is optional; if not modified, the rule ID and alert ID are combined as `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` to form the correlation ID value in ServiceNow. The maximum character length for this value is 100 characters.
              NOTE: Using the default configuration of `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` ensures that ServiceNow creates a separate incident record for every generated alert that uses a unique alert ID. If the rule generates multiple alerts that use the same alert IDs, ServiceNow creates and continually updates a single incident record for the alert.
