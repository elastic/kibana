                  The correlation identifier for the security incident. Connectors using the same correlation ID are associated with the same ServiceNow incident. This value determines whether a new ServiceNow incident is created or an existing one is updated. Modifying this value is optional; if not modified, the rule ID and alert ID are combined as `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` to form the correlation ID value in ServiceNow. The maximum character length for this value is 100 characters.
                  NOTE: Using the default configuration of `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` ensures that ServiceNow creates a separate incident record for every generated alert that uses a unique alert ID. If the rule generates multiple alerts that use the same alert IDs, ServiceNow creates and continually updates a single incident record for the alert.
