This is an override to replicate the previous full-page-width of the transforms creation wizard
when it was in use within the ML plugin. The Kibana management section limits a max-width to 1200px
which is a bit narrow for the two column layout of the transform wizard. We might revisit this for
future versions to blend in more with the overall design of the Kibana management section.
The management section's navigation width is 192px + 24px right margin
