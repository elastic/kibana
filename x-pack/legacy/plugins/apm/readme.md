# Documentation for APM UI developers

### Setup local environment

#### Kibana

```
git clone git@github.com:elastic/kibana.git
cd kibana/
yarn kbn bootstrap
yarn start --no-base-path
```

#### APM Server, Elasticsearch and data

To access an elasticsearch instance that has live data you have two options:

##### A. Connect to Elasticsearch on Cloud (internal devs only)

Find the credentials for the cluster [here](https://github.com/elastic/apm-dev/blob/master/docs/credentials/apm-ui-clusters.md#apmelstcco)

##### B. Start Elastic Stack and APM data generators

```
git clone git@github.com:elastic/apm-integration-testing.git
cd apm-integration-testing/
./scripts/compose.py start master --all --no-kibana
```

_Docker Compose is required_

### Setup default APM users

APM behaves differently depending on which the role and permissions a logged in user has.
For testing purposes APM uses 3 custom users:

**apm_read_user**: Apps: read. Indices: read (`apm-*`)

**apm_write_user**: Apps: read/write. Indices: read (`apm-*`)

**kibana_write_user** Apps: read/write. Indices: None

To create the users with the correct roles run the following script:

```sh
node x-pack/legacy/plugins/apm/scripts/setup-kibana-security.js --role-suffix <github-username-or-something-unique>
```

The users will be created with the password specified in kibana.dev.yml for `elasticsearch.password`

### Debugging Elasticsearch queries

All APM api endpoints accept `_debug=true` as a query param that will result in the underlying ES query being outputted in the Kibana backend process.

Example:
`/api/apm/services/my_service?_debug=true`

### Unit testing

Note: Run the following commands from `kibana/x-pack`.

#### Run unit tests

```
node scripts/jest.js plugins/apm --watch
```

#### Update snapshots

```
node scripts/jest.js plugins/apm --updateSnapshot
```

### Linting

_Note: Run the following commands from `kibana/`._

#### Prettier

```
yarn prettier  "./x-pack/legacy/plugins/apm/**/*.{tsx,ts,js}" --write
```

#### ESLint

```
yarn eslint ./x-pack/legacy/plugins/apm --fix
```

#### Storybook

Start the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) development environment with
`yarn storybook apm`. All files with a .stories.tsx extension will be loaded.
You can access the development environment at http://localhost:9001.
