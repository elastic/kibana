We store information collected from the user about this logical grouping such as a name and any other information we need about it to generate the associated config. A package defines its own data source templates that can use user-provided values to generate the data source config. A single data source will typically enable users to collect both logs and metrics. A data source can be in multiple policies at the same time. A datasource can have multiple streams.",
