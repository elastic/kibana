  // This is a temporary hack to make the workpad list scrollable on smaller
  // screen sizes as part of https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/37345.
  // Without this hack you cannot reach workpads further down the list.
  //
  // The real underlying issue here is that we're re-using the workpad loader
  // EuiModal as home page content, thus ending up with style overrides as this
  // is not the intended modal usage. Once the home page is redesigned to a
  // card-style layout, we can clean up these overrides.
  //
  // A hack solution feels commensurate with the current level of Canvas
  // support on smaller devices. In other words, there are much more limiting
  // factors, at present, beyond choosing a workpad.
