  "description": "This signal detects events that may indicate the use of FTP network connections to the Internet.\nThe File Transfer Protocol (FTP) has been around in its current form since the\n1980's. It can be an efficient and normal procedure on your network to send and\nreceive files. Because it is common and efficient, adversaries will also often\nuse this protocol to ex-filtrate data from your network or download new tools.\nAdditionally, FTP is a plain-text protocol which may expose your user name and\npassword, if intercepted. FTP activity involving servers subject to regulations or compliance standards may be unauthorized.\n",
  "false_positives": [
    "FTP servers should be excluded from this rule as this is expected behavior for them. Some business work-flows may use FTP for data exchange. These work-flows often have expected characteristics such as users, sources and destinations. FTP activity involving an unusual source or destination may be more suspicious. FTP activity involving a production server that has no known associated FTP work-flow or business requirement is often suspicious. NEW NEW"
