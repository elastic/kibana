Temporary README.md for users and developers working on the backend detection engine
for how to get started.

# Setup for Users

If you're just a user and want to enable the REST interfaces and UI screens do the following.
NOTE: this is very temporary and once alerting and actions is enabled by default you will no
longer have to do these steps

Set the environment variable ALERTING_FEATURE_ENABLED to be true in your .profile or your windows
global environment variable.

```sh
export ALERTING_FEATURE_ENABLED=true
```

In your `kibana.yml` file enable alerting and actions like so:

```sh
# Feature flag to turn on alerting
xpack.alerting.enabled: true

# Feature flag to turn on actions which goes with alerting
xpack.actions.enabled: true
```

Start Kibana and you will see these messages indicating signals is activated like so:

```sh
server    log   [11:39:05.561] [info][siem] Detected feature flags for actions and alerting and enabling signals API endpoints
```

If you see crashes like this:

```ts
 FATAL  Error: Unmet requirement "alerting" for plugin "siem"
```

It is because Kibana is not picking up your changes from `kibana.yml` and not seeing that alerting and actions is enabled.

# For Developers

See these two other pages for references:
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/legacy/plugins/alerting/README.md
https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/x-pack/legacy/plugins/actions

Since there is no UI yet and a lot of backend areas that are not created, you
should install the kbn-action and kbn-alert project from here:
https://github.com/pmuellr/kbn-action

The scripts rely on CURL and jq, ensure both of these are installed:

```sh
brew update
brew install curl
brew install jq
```

Open up your .zshrc/.bashrc and add these lines with the variables filled in:

```sh
export ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME=${user}
export ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD=${password}
export ELASTICSEARCH_URL=https://${ip}:9200
export KIBANA_URL=http://localhost:5601
export SIGNALS_INDEX=.siem-signals-${your user id}
export TASK_MANAGER_INDEX=.kibana-task-manager-${your user id}
export KIBANA_INDEX=.kibana-${your user id}

# This is for the kbn-action and kbn-alert tool
export KBN_URLBASE=http://${user}:${password}@localhost:5601
```

source your .zhsrc/.bashrc or open a new terminal to ensure you get the new values set.

Optional env var when set to true will utilize `reindex` api for reindexing
instead of the scroll and bulk index combination.

```sh
export USE_REINDEX_API=true
```

Add these lines to your `kibana.dev.yml` to turn on the feature toggles of alerting and actions:

```sh
# Feature flag to turn on alerting
xpack.alerting.enabled: true

# Feature flag to turn on actions which goes with alerting
xpack.actions.enabled: true
```

Restart Kibana and ensure that you are using `--no-base-path` as changing the base path is a feature but will
get in the way of the CURL scripts written as is. You should see alerting and actions starting up like so afterwards

```sh
server    log   [22:05:22.277] [info][status][plugin:alerting@8.0.0] Status changed from uninitialized to green - Ready
server    log   [22:05:22.270] [info][status][plugin:actions@8.0.0] Status changed from uninitialized to green - Ready
```

You should also see the SIEM detect the feature flags and start the API endpoints for signals

```sh
server    log   [11:39:05.561] [info][siem] Detected feature flags for actions and alerting and enabling signals API endpoints
```

Open a terminal and go into the scripts folder `cd kibana/x-pack/legacy/plugins/siem/server/lib/detection_engine/scripts` and run:

```sh
./hard_reset.sh
./post_signal.sh
```

which will:

- Delete any existing actions you have
- Delete any existing alerts you have
- Delete any existing alert tasks you have
- Delete any existing signal mapping you might have had.
- Add the latest signal index and its mappings using your settings from `SIGNALS_INDEX` environment variable.
- Posts the sample signal from `signals/root_or_admin_1.json` by replacing its `output_index` with your `SIGNALS_INDEX` environment variable
- The sample signal checks for root or admin every 5 minutes and reports that as a signal if it is a positive hit

Now you can run

```sh
./find_signals.sh
```

You should see the new signals created like so:

```sh
{
  "page": 1,
  "perPage": 20,
  "total": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      "created_by": "elastic",
      "description": "Detecting root and admin users",
      "enabled": true,
      "false_positives": [],
      "from": "now-6m",
      "id": "a556065c-0656-4ba1-ad64-a77ca9d2013b",
      "immutable": false,
      "index": [
        "auditbeat-*",
        "filebeat-*",
        "packetbeat-*",
        "winlogbeat-*"
      ],
      "interval": "5m",
      "rule_id": "rule-1",
      "language": "kuery",
      "output_index": ".siem-signals-frank-hassanabad",
      "max_signals": 100,
      "risk_score": 1,
      "name": "Detect Root/Admin Users",
      "query": "user.name: root or user.name: admin",
      "references": [
        "http://www.example.com",
        "https://ww.example.com"
      ],
      "severity": "high",
      "updated_by": "elastic",
      "tags": [],
      "to": "now",
      "type": "query"
    }
  ]
}
```

Every 5 minutes if you get positive hits you will see messages on info like so:

```sh
server    log   [09:54:59.013] [info][plugins][siem] Total signals found from signal rule "id: a556065c-0656-4ba1-ad64-a77ca9d2013b", "ruleId: rule-1": 10000
```

See the scripts folder and the tools for more command line fun.

Add the `.siem-signals-${your user id}` to your advanced SIEM settings to see any signals
created which should update once every 5 minutes at this point.

Also add the `.siem-signals-${your user id}` as a kibana index for Maps to be able to see the
signals

Optionally you can add these debug statements to your `kibana.dev.yml` to see more information when running the detection
engine

```sh
logging.verbose: true
logging.events:
  {
    log: ['siem', 'info', 'warning', 'error', 'fatal'],
    request: ['info', 'warning', 'error', 'fatal'],
    error: '*',
    ops: __no-ops__,
  }
```
