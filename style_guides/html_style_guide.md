# HTML Style Guide

## Camel case ID and other attribute values

Use camel case for the values of attributes such as IDs and data test subject selectors.

```html
<button
  id="veryImportantButton"
  data-test-subj="clickMeButton"
>
  Click me
</button>
```

The only exception is in cases where you're dynamically creating the value, and you need to use
hyphens as delimiters:

```html
<button
  ng-repeat="button in buttons"
  id="{{ 'veryImportantButton-' + button.id }}"
  data-test-subj="{{ 'clickMeButton-' + button.id }}"
>
  {{ button.label }}
</button>
```

## Capitalization in HTML and CSS should always match

It's important that when you write CSS selectors using classes, IDs, and attributes
(keeping in mind that we should _never_ use IDs and attributes in our selectors), that the
capitalization in the CSS matches that used in the HTML. [HTML and CSS follow different case sensitivity rules](http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/casesensitivity), and we can avoid subtle gotchas by ensuring we use the
same capitalization in both of them.

## Multiple attribute values

When an element has multiple attributes, each attribute including the first should be on its own line with a single indent.
This makes the attributes easier to scan and compare across similar elements.

The closing bracket should be on its own line. This allows attributes to be shuffled and edited without having to move the bracket around. It also makes it easier to scan vertically and match opening and closing brackets. This format
is inspired by the positioning of the opening and closing parentheses in [Pug/Jade](https://pugjs.org/language/attributes.html#multiline-attributes).

```html
<div
  attribute1="value1"
  attribute2="value2"
  attribute3="value3"
>
  Hello
</div>
```

If the element doesn't have children, add the closing tag on the same line as the opening tag's closing bracket.

```html
<div
  attribute1="value1"
  attribute2="value2"
  attribute3="value3"
></div>
```

## Accessibility

### Don't use the `title` attribute

The `title` has no clear role within the accessibility standards. 
[See the HTML5 spec](http://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html#the-title-attribute) for more information.

To provide supplementary, descriptive information about a form control, button, link, or other element, use
a tooltip component instead.

### Tooltips

Elements which act as tooltips should have the `role="tooltip"` attribute and an ID to which the
described element can point to with the `aria-describedby` attribute. For example:

```html
<div
  class="kuiTooltip"
  role="tooltip"
  id="visualizationsTooltip"
>
  Visualizations help you make sense of your data.
</div>

<button aria-describedby="visualizationsTooltip">
 Visualizations
</button>
```

### Prefer `button` and `a` when making interactive elements keyboard-accessible

If something is meant to be clickable, favor using a `button` or `a` tag before over the `kui-accessible-click` directive or `KuiKeyboardAccessible` component. These tools are useful as they augment non-clickable elements with `onkeypress` and `onkeyup` handlers, allowing non-clickable elements to become keyboard accessible. However, `button` and `a` tags provide this functionality natively.

### Use `tabindex` to make elements tabbable

When added to the tab order, elements become focusable via non-sticky-mode keyboard navigation.
To add an element to the tab order, you must add an `id` attribute as well as a `tabindex` attribute. If you don't know which number to use for the tab index, or if you simply want to add it to the general flow of the document, use `tabindex="0"`.
