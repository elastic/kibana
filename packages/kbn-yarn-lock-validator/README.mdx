`@kbn/yarn-lock-validator` provides yarn.lock validation logic for the Kibana project. It is loaded up by <DocLink id="kibDevDocsOpsKbnPm" /> after bootstrap and validates that we haven't accidentally re-introduced specific dependencies or version-combination scenarios detailed below:

## validation scenarios

 - Only a single version of lodash@4 is installed
 - No lodash@3 versions installed
 - None of the bazel packages in `"dependencies"`, and none of the transient dependencies of those packages, are marked as `"devOnly": true`
