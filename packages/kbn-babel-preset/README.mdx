This package contains the shared bits of babel config that we use for transpiling our source code to code compatible with Node.JS and the various [browsers we support](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_browsers).

## Usage

To use those presets add either `@kbn/babel-preset/node_preset` or `@kbn/babel-preset/webpack_preset` into the babel config file.

`@kbn/babel-preset/node_preset` is usually placed in a [`babel.config.js` file](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/configuration#babelconfigjs).

`@kbn/babel-preset/webpack_preset` is usually placed directly in a `webpack` configuration.

If you're transpiling code that will be run in both the browser and node you must transpile your code twice, once for each target. 

Along with the introduction of Bazel to build packages we also provide now an easier way to easily use the babel transpiler by using the `js_ts_tarnspiler` rule with our without the `web` property enabled. 
Take a look for example at `@kbn/i18n` to see how that can look.
