At the moment plugins can live in a couple of different places and in the future will be able 
to live anywhere in the repository. This is a package that holds custom logic useful to find and 
parse those.

## parseKibanaPlatformPlugin

It returns a platform plugin for a given manifest path

## getPluginSearchPaths

It returns the paths where plugins will be searched for

## simpleKibanaPlatformPluginDiscovery

It finds and returns the new platform plugins
