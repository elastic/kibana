The Kibana ToolingLog is a basic logger used by just about all tooling in the Kibana respository that gives us a single indented logging interface to manage.

In the Functional Test Runner, or in the vast majority of CLIs/scripts, a log instance is created for you and should be reused so that the level/output/indent level are synced across uses.

To get the `ToolingLog` instance in the Functional Test Runner use `getService('log')`.

To get the `ToolingLog` instance in CLIs, it's passed to the function at the root of the CLI:
```ts
import { run } from '@kbn/dev-utils'
run(async ({ flags, log }) => {
  log.info('hello')
  await ...
});
```
