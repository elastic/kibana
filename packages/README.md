## Kibana-related node modules

This folder contains node modules that are created by Kibana developers, for use in Kibana and its plugins.

For each such node module, create a sub-folder in this folder. The path/name of the folder should mirror the `name` in the node module's `package.json`. To publish the node module as an npm package, `cd` into the package's sub-folder, and run `npm publish` as usual.
