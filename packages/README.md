## Kibana-related Packages

This folder contains packages that are created by Kibana developers, for use in Kibana and its plugins.

For each such package, create a sub-folder in this folder. The path/name of the folder should mirror the name of the package. To publish the package, `cd` into the package's sub-folder, and run `npm publish` as usual.
