# @kbn/guided-onboarding

To run in development you will need the following settings in your kibana.dev.yml:

xpack.cloud.id: 'testID'

There are two versions - currently called `classic` and the one used by default. This is designed to be used for A/B testing and retain the original guide card implementation.
