/**
 * Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output
 * Observable.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```js
 * const source = $from([1, 2, 3]);
 * const observable = source.pipe(
 *   mergeMap(x => $of('a', x + 1))
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * Results in the following items emitted:
 * - a
 * - 2
 * - a
 * - 3
 * - a
 * - 4
 *
 * As you can see it merges the returned observable and emits every value from
 * that observable. You can think of it as being the same as `flatMap` on an
 * array, just that you return an Observable instead of an array.
 *
 * For more complex use-cases where you need the source variable for each value
 * in the newly created observable, an often used pattern is using `map` within
 * the `mergeMap`. E.g. let's say we want to return both the current value and
 * the newly created value:
 *
 * ```js
 * mergeMap(val =>
 *   someFn(val).pipe(
 *     map(newVal => ({ val, newVal })
 *   )
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Here you would go from having an observable of `val`s, to having an
 * observable of `{ val, newVal }` objects.
 *
 * @param project A function that, when applied to an item emitted by the source
 * Observable, returns an Observable.
