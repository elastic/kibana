Converts a testSubject selector into a CSS selector.

testSubject selector syntax rules:

  - `data-test-subj` values can include spaces

  - prefixing a value with `~` will allow matching a single word in a `data-test-subj` that uses several space delimited list words
    - example: `~foo`
    - css equivalent: `[data-test-subj~="foo"]`

  - the `>` character is used between two values to indicate that the value on the right must match an element inside an element matched by the value on the left
    - example: `foo > bar`
    - css equivalent: `[data-test-subj=foo] [data-test-subj=bar]`

  - the `&` character is used between two values to indicate that the value on both sides must both match the element
    - example: `foo & bar`
    - css equivalent: `[data-test-subj=foo][data-test-subj=bar]`
