# Autogenerated API documentation

[RFC](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/legacy_rfcs/text/0014_api_documentation.md))

This is an experimental api documentation system that is managed by the Kibana Tech Leads until
we determine the value of such a system and what kind of maintenance burder it will incur.

To generate the docs run 

```
node scripts/build_api_docs
```
