# Autogenerated API documentation

[RFC](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/legacy_rfcs/text/0014_api_documentation.md))

This is an experimental api documentation system that is managed by the Kibana Tech Leads until
we determine the value of such a system and what kind of maintenance burden it will incur.

To generate the docs run 

```
node scripts/build_api_docs
```

To validate documentation without writing files, run

```
node scripts/check_package_docs --plugin <pluginId>
```

You can use `--plugin` to filter by plugin id and `--package` to filter by package id (manifest.id). These filters can be used independently or together. Validation flags:

- `--check <any|comments|exports|all>` (optional, defaults to `all`).
- You may pass multiple `--check` flags to combine specific checks.

The `--stats` flag on `build_api_docs` is deprecated and routes to `check_package_docs`.
