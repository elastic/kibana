/**
 * `User` is unlike most other fields which can be reused in multiple places
 * in that ECS places restrictions on which individual properties can be reused;
 *
 * Specifically, `changes`, `effective`, and `target` may be used if `user` is
 * placed at the root level, but not if it is nested inside another field like
 * `destination`. A more detailed explanation of these nuances can be found at:
 *
 * https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/1.9/ecs-user-usage.html
 *
 * As a result, we need to export a separate `NestedUser` type to import into
 * other interfaces internally. This contains the reusable subset of properties
 * from `User`.
