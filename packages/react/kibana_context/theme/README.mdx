## Description

This package contains a "theming" context for Kibana.  A corollary to EUI's `EuiThemeProvider`, it uses Kibana services to ensure the EUI Theme is customized correctly.

Up until now, there has been some confusion as to the difference between `EuiThemeProvider` and `EuiProvider`.  They've been used interchangeably, which created some unnoticed
side effects.  In addition, _nesting_ of `EuiThemeProvider` has led to additional nodes being rendered to the DOM.

This context allows us to have a single source of truth for the theme in Kibana, and ensures that the theme is applied correctly.  It also abstracts away any updates or changes
made to the `EuiThemeProvider` in the future.

```ts

// Make a component always display in dark mode.
import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';
import { KibanaThemeContextProvider, type KibanaTheme } from '@kbn/react-kibana-context-theme';

import { MyComponent } from './my_component';

export const AlwaysDarkMode = () => {
  // We've purposefully excluded `colorMode` from the props of the provider
  // to enforce the use of the `theme$` observable.  This prevents consumers
  // from confusing which takes precedence, (or what needs to be set in most
  // cases).
  const theme$ = new BehaviorSubject<KibanaTheme>({ darkMode: true }));

  return (
    <KibanaThemeContextProvider theme={{ theme$ }}>
      <MyComponent />
    </KibanaThemeContextProvider>
  );
};


import { EuiThemeShape, RecursivePartial } from '@elastic/eui';

// Change the EUI theme colors in dark and light mode.
export const ChangeEuiTheme = ({ theme }: CoreStart) => {
  const modify: RecursivePartial<EuiThemeShape> = {
    colors: {
      DARK: {
        text: '#abc',
        accent: '#123',
      },
      LIGHT: {
        text: '#123',
        accent: '#abc',
      },
    },
  };

  return (
    <KibanaThemeProvider {...{ theme, modify }}>
      <MyComponent />
    </KibanaThemeProvider>
  );
};
```
