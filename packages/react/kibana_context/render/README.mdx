## Description

The `KibanaRenderContextProvider` is designed to be used with ad-hoc renders of React components, (usually with `ReactDOM.render`).

When Kibana starts, the `KibanaRootContextProvider` is used by the `RenderService` to initialize EUI and Emotion... it should only be rendered _once_.  Still, there are times when you need to render a new component tree and need things like `i18n` and the current theme to be made available in a consistent way.  The `KibanaRenderContextProvider` is designed to be used in these cases.  In addition, it allows us to abstract away any changes or other complexities with React context that we may introduce in the future.

```ts 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { KibanaRenderContextProvider } from '@kbn/react-kibana-context-render';

import { MyComponent } from './my_component';

const App = ({i18n, theme}: CoreStart) => {
  return (
    <KibanaRenderContextProvider {...{i18n, theme}}>
      <MyComponent />
    </KibanaRenderContextProvider>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('some_node'));
```
