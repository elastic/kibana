## Description

Before `emotion` was introduced, some components used `styled-components` to easily apply EUI variables and apply style.  This package is an isolated location for this code and included for compatibility with those components.

It should _not_ be used in new code.

**NOTE:** plugins cannot use `styled-components` and `emotion` at the same time, their Babel plugins conflict.  The EUI team has fielded many questions about this.  The best solution is to migrate to `emotion` and not use `styled-components`.
