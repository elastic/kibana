# kbn-securitysolution-io-ts-utils

Temporary location for all the io-ts-utils from security solutions. This is a lift-and-shift, where
we are moving them here for phase 1.

Phase 2 is deprecating across plugins any copied code or sharing of io-ts utils that are now in here.

Phase 3 is replacing those deprecated types with the ones in here.

Phase 4+ is (potentially) consolidating any duplication or everything altogether with the `kbn-io-ts-utils` project
