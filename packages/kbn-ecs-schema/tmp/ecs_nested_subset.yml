agent:
  description: 'The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if any,
    that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements on
    a host.

    Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields shall
    be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer where the
    event happened or the measurement was taken.'
  fields:
    timestamp:
      dashed_name: timestamp
      description: 'Date/time when the event originated.

        This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
        the event was generated by the source.

        If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
        by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

        Required field for all events.'

        This field is intended to contain any build information that a data source
        may provide, no specific formatting is required.'

      description: 'Custom name of the agent.

        This is a name that can be given to an agent. This can be helpful if for example
        two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation
        is needed on which Filebeat instance data is coming from.

        If no name is given, the name is often left empty.'

        instances are run on the same machine.'

  footnote: 'Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat.
    For APM, it is the agent running in the app/service. The agent information does
    not change if data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing
    systems such as Logstash or APM Server.'
