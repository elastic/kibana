/**
 *  Takes a URL and a function that takes the meaningful parts
 *  of the URL as a key-value object, modifies some or all of
 *  the parts, and returns the modified parts formatted again
 *  as a url.
 *
 *  Url Parts sent:
 *    - protocol
 *    - slashes (does the url have the //)
 *    - auth
 *    - hostname (just the name of the host, no port or auth information)
 *    - port
 *    - pathname (the path after the hostname, no query or hash, starts
 *        with a slash if there was a path)
 *    - query (always an object, even when no query on original url)
 *    - hash
 *
 *  Why?
 *    - The default url library in node produces several conflicting
 *      properties on the "parsed" output. Modifying any of these might
 *      lead to the modifications being ignored (depending on which
 *      property was modified)
 *    - It's not always clear whether to use path/pathname, host/hostname,
 *      so this tries to add helpful constraints
 *
 *  @param url The string url to parse.
 *  @param urlModifier A function that will modify the parsed url, or return a new one.
 *  @returns The modified and reformatted url
