This is an example Kibana plugin where you can play around with the
`kbn-types` package.

Before playing around with this, make sure to build the `kbn-types` package.

After `kbn-types` is built, go back to this folder and run:

```
npm install
```

Then you can either build the TypeScript once using `npm build` or with
watching using `npm start`. The resulting JavaScript is built into `./target`.
