This package contains VSCode settings which are automatically setup for contributors on bootstrap. This is done via the <DocLink id="kibDevDocsOpsManagedVscodeConfigCli" /> using `node scripts/update_vscode_config`.

In order to support contributors maintaining workspace-specific configuration of their own, this tool prefixes all managed config settings with `// @managed` comments. If you want to override any config that is `// @managed` then just update that comment to `// self managed` and the update script won't touch that key/value.

`// self managed` comments are only necessary for keys which are currently or might become managed in the future. Config keys which are not managed are always preserved when updating the `.vscode` directory.
