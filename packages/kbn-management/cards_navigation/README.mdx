This component is simply in charge of rendering a list of links to other management apps. It also
makes sure that the apps are enabled before doing so and it also aggregates them into predefined
categories.

### Adding new items to the navigation

There are two distinctive ways of adding items to the navigation;

- to add navigation items that would be visible across all consumers of this package all you have to do is;

  * edit the `cards_navigation/src/types.tsx` file and add the app id into the `appIds` enum (make sure that the app_id value matches the one from the plugin)
  * edit the `cards_navigation/src/const.tsx`, add a new entry to the `appDefinitions` object. In here you can specify the category where you want it to be, icon and description.

- To add a localized navigation item that would only exist within the context of usage for this component, an "extend card navigation" definition can be passed in like so; 

  ```typescript
  <CardsNavigation
    sections={sections}
    appBasePath={appBasePath}
    extendedCardNavigationDefinitions={{
      visualize: {
        category: 'content',
        description: 'create different visualizations based on your data.'
        icon: 'visualizeApp',
      },
    }}
  />
  ```

  In the example above assuming the key `visualize` is a valid registered management app ID, this definition would show up as a navigation card under the predefined category `content`. It's also worth pointing out that there's also 
  an opt out functionality that allows one to provide definitions that don't map to management app, and requires that the property `skipValidation` be passed and set to true, in this case the responsibility is on the 
  user passing the defintion to also provide the `href` that the card will link to, and it's `title`.

### Removing an item from the navigation

If an item needs to be hidden from the navigation you can specify that by using the `hideLinksTo` prop like so:

```typescript
<CardsNavigation
  sections={sections}
  appBasePath={appBasePath}
  hideLinksTo={[ appIds.RULES, appIds.TAGS ]}
/>

```

In case an app needs to be removed all together from all the solutions you can remove its
definition from the `consts.tsx` file. The app might still be visible in the side nav, so if you
want to remove all links to it from management but without disabling the plugin you will have
to remove it from the side nav too.

Bare in mind that if the app is disabled then it will be hidden anyway from the cards navigation
and from the sidenav.
