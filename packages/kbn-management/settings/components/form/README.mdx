## Description

This package contains a component for rendering the Advanced Settings UI form that contains `FieldRow` components, each of which displays a single UiSetting field row.
The form also handles the logic for saving any changes to the UiSettings values by directly communicating with the uiSettings service.


## Notes

- This implementation was extracted from the `Form` component in the `advancedSettings` plugin.
