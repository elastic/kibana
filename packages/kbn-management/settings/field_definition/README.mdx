## Description

This package contains utilities for creating and examining Field Definitions from Advanced Settings.

Since a raw `UiSetting` is not type-safe and can be difficult to work with in the UX, this `FieldDefinition` provides a type-safe abstraction over the raw `UiSetting` _and_ provides additional UI-centric information derived from the setting.
