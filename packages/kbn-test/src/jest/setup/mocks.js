/**
 * READ THIS BEFORE ADDING NEW MOCKS TO THIS FILE!
 *
 * This file should be loaded via `setupFilesAfterEnv` in all jest configs of the project.
 * It instantiates some of the very basic mocks that should be available in all jest tests.
 * Most of the mocks should just be instantiated in the test suites that require them.
 * We only activate a very rare amount of mocks here, that are used somewhere down the dependency
 * tree in nearly every test and their implementation is never working without mocking in any tests.
 * Before adding a mock here it should be considered, whether it's not better to instantiate that mock
 * in the test suites that needs them individually and if it's really needed to have that mock enabled
 * for all jest tests by default.
 *
 * The mocks that are enabled that way live inside the `__mocks__` folders beside their implementation files.
