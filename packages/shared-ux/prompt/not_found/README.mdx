Sometimes the user tries to go to a page that doesn't exist, because the URL is broken or because they try to load a resource that does not exist. For those cases we want to show a standard 404 error.

The default call to action is a "Go back" button that simulates the browser's "Back" behaviour. Consumers can specify their own CTA's with the `actions` prop.

The NotFoundPrompt component also has the prop `actions` that takes in an array of components. 
For example: 

```jsx
    <EuiPageTemplate>
      <EuiPageTemplate.Section alignment="center">
        <NotFoundPrompt
          actions={
            [
              <EuiButton fill color="primary" onClick={onClickHandler}>
                Go home
              </EuiButton>,
              <EuiButton iconType="search">
                Go to discover
              </EuiButton>
            ]
          }
          title="Customizable Title"
          body="Customizable Body"
        />
      </EuiPageTemplate.Section>
    </EuiPageTemplate>
```
