## Description

A wrapper around `<EuiFilePicker />` that provides state management for the upload process using the `FileClient`.

## Usage

Must be wrapped in the `FilesContext`.

```tsx
<FilesContext ...>
  <FileUpload ... />
</FilesContext>
```

## Variants

### Default

The default layout should sit nicely in a form, modal or flyout.

### Compressed

When space is constrained you can render a smaller version of the UI by passing the `compressed` prop. This variant will be smaller in size, and start uploading a file immediately once it receives it.
