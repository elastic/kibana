## Description

A light wrapper around [EuiImage](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/display/image) that introduces some "file-aware" functionality like displaying a [blurhash](https://blurha.sh/) before the final image loads.

## Lazy loading

It is a good practice to leverage the browser-native lazy loading of images. Depending on your use case, make sure that content can be loaded lazily where possible.

For more information see the [loading attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-loading) for more information.
