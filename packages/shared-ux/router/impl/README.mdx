## Summary
This is a wrapper around the `react-router-dom` Route component that inserts MatchPropagator in every application route. It helps track all route changes and send them to the execution context, later used to enrich APM 'route-change' transactions.
The component does not require any props and accepts props from the RouteProps interface such as a `path`, or a component like `AppContainer`. 

```jsx
export interface RouteProps {
    location?: H.Location;
    component?: React.ComponentType<RouteComponentProps<any>> | React.ComponentType<any>;
    render?: (props: RouteComponentProps<any>) => React.ReactNode;
    children?: ((props: RouteChildrenProps<any>) => React.ReactNode) | React.ReactNode;
    path?: string | string[];
    exact?: boolean;
    sensitive?: boolean;
    strict?: boolean;
}
```


```jsx 
<Route basepath="/url" />
```

This component removes the need for manual calls to `useExecutionContext` and should be removed.
