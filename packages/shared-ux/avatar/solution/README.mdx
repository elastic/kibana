## Description

A wrapper around `EuiAvatar` tailored for use in Kibana solutions.

## Usage

If using for a known solution, (e.g. one whose logo is in EUI as `logoSomeSolution`), you can simply set the `name` prop:

```tsx
<KibanaSolutionAvatar name="Kibana" size="xl" />
```

If the name provided does not match a known solution, you *must* set the `iconType` prop:

```tsx
<KibanaSolutionAvatar name="Hello World!" size="xl" iconType="logoElastic" />
```
