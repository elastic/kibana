This package exposes a simple `parse(jsonc: string)` function for parsing JSON-C content. JSON-C is a variant of JSON which supports both block and line comments, which are incredibly useful for configuration files that are committed to the repository and would benefit from the context of comments.

Additionally supported in JSON-C... TRAILING COMMAS!

VSCode and TypeScript use jsonc for their config files, so we're already using it in a lot of places, but we're going to start using it in more places too. This package is implemented in vanilla JS with a vendored copy of [`strip-json-comments`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-json-comments) so that we can use this code from kbn_pm without node modules installed.

## API

### parse(jsonc: string): any

Parses a JSON-C string into the value defined by the content.
