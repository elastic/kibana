# @kbn/validate-next-docs-cli

Clone a bunch of repos needed to build the next-docs with the latest version of the changes in the repo. This is only used for validating changes in CI with full validation of all IDs. This isn't intended for local development (except for debugging).

To build the docs locally run: `./scripts/dev_docs.sh`
