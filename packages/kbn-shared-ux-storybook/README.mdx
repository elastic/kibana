## About Shared UX Storybook

This package provides the Storybook implementation of `@kbn/shared-ux-services` as well as the configuration for the Shared UX Storybook site.

- `/src/services` The `@kbn/shared-ux-services` implementation.
- `src/config` The Storybook site configuration.

## Storybook site

Run `yarn storybook shared_ux` from `/kibana` to view the site.  It pulls in `*.stories.tsx` from all Shared UX packages and plugins and combines them into a single configuration.

## Decorator

If you're writing stories for your own components that compose Shared UX components, you can use a pre-configured [Storybook Decorator](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/decorators) in your Storybook configuration:

```ts
// preview.ts

import { addDecorator } from '@storybook/react';
import { servicesDecorator } from '@kbn/shared-ux-storybook';

addDecorator(servicesDecorator);
```

This will not only expose parameters, but also wrap your story in a pre-wired `SharedUxServicesProvider`.
