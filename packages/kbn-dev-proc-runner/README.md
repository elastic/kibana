# @kbn/dev-proc-runner

A class orignally extracted from [`grunt-run`](https://github.com/spalger/grunt-run) which allows running processes without managing the state of the process while it's running, wait for a specific log message or other sign of readiness, and then stop all started processes with a single call.
