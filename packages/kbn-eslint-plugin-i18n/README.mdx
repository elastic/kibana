`@kbn/eslint-plugin-i18n` is an ESLint plugin providing custom rules for validating JSXCode in the Kibana repo to make sure they are translated.

Note: At the moment these rules only work for apps that are inside `/x-pack/plugins`.
If you want to enable this rule on code that is outside of this path, adjust `/helpers/get_i18n_identifier_from_file_path.ts`.

## `@kbn/i18n/strings_should_be_translated_with_i18n`

This rule warns engineers to translate their strings by using i18n.translate from the '@kbn/i18n' package. It provides an autofix that takes into account the context of the translatable string in the JSX tree to generate a translation ID.
It kicks in on JSXText elements and specific JSXAttributes (`label` and `aria-label`) which expect a translated value.

## `@kbn/i18n/strings_should_be_translated_with_formatted_message`

This rule warns engineers to translate their strings by using `<FormattedMessage>` from the '@kbn/i18n-react' package. It provides an autofix that takes into account the context of the translatable string in the JSX tree and to generate a translation ID.
It kicks in on JSXText elements and specific JSXAttributes (`label` and `aria-label`) which expect a translated value.

## Exemptions and exceptions

A JSXText element or JSXAttribute `label` or `aria-label` of which the value is:

- wrapped in a `EuiCode` or `EuiBetaBadge` component,
- made up of non alpha characters such as `!@#$%^&*(){}` or numbers,
- wrapped in three backticks,

are exempt from this rule.

If this rule kicks in on a string value that you don't like, you can escape it by wrapping the string inside a JSXExpression: `{'my escaped value'}`.
