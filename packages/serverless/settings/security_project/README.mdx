This package contains a list of UI settings that are only available in the Serverless Security project.
This list is consumed by the `security_solution_serverless` plugin, which sets up its project settings:

```ts
export class SecuritySolutionServerlessPlugin
  implements
    Plugin<
      SecuritySolutionServerlessPluginSetup,
      SecuritySolutionServerlessPluginStart,
      SecuritySolutionServerlessPluginSetupDeps,
      SecuritySolutionServerlessPluginStartDeps
    >
{
  public setup(coreSetup: CoreSetup, pluginsSetup: SecuritySolutionServerlessPluginSetupDeps) {
    pluginsSetup.serverless.setupProjectSettings(SECURITY_PROJECT_SETTINGS);
    return {};
  }
}
```

If you need to register a setting that should be available in the Serverless Security project, make sure to add
its Id to this list.
