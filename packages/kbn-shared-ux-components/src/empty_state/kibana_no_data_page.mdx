## Description

Many plugins display "no data" page, either when there is no data in Elasticsearch, or there haven't been any data views created yet. This component is meant
to be used in those scenarios. It displays an appropriate message to the user and facilitate addition of integrations and creation of data views. 

## Component: `KibanaNoDataPage`

- uses `hasUserDataView` and `hasData` API from `HasData` service in `data_views` plugin to check for existence of data / data views
- uses `onDataViewCreated` callback to be called once the data view has been created
- receives (noDataConfig)[https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/packages/kbn-shared-ux-components/src/page_template/no_data_page/types.ts] as configuration for the page in case of no data
- needs to be wrapped in `ServicesContext` provided by the start contract of the `shared_ux` plugin to be used
