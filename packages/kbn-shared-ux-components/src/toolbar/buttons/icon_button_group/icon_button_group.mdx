This component requires a prop that consists of a series of buttons that can then be displayed based on the number of buttons desired. An example of a button that can be part of an array of icon buttons is included below:

```
  {
    label: 'Text',
    onClick: clickHandler,
    iconType: 'visText',
  }
```
