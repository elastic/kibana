/**
 * Generates a random number within the given range where the lower bound is inclusive and the upper bound is exclusive. If no numbers are passed in, it will return a number between 0 and 1. If only one number is passed in, it will return .
 * @param {number} a (optional) must be greater than 0 if `b` is not provided
 * @param {number} b (optional) must be greater
 * @return {number} A random number between 0 and 1 if no numbers are passed in. Returns a random number between 0 and `a` if only one number is passed in. Returns a random number between `a` and `b` if two numbers are passed in.
 * @throws `'Min is be greater than max'` if `a` < 0 when only `a` is passed in or if `a` > `b` when both `a` and `b` are passed in
 * @example
 * random() // returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)
 * random(10) // returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive)
 * random(-10,10) // returns a random number between -10 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive)
