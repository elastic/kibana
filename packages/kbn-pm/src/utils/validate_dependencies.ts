      If you still see this error when you re-bootstrap then you might need
      to force a new dependency to use the latest version of lodash via the
      "resolutions" field in package.json.

      Due to changes in the yarn.lock file and/or package.json files a version of
      lodash 3 is now included in the production dependencies. To reduce the size of
      our distributable and especially our front-end bundles we have decided to
      prevent adding any new instances of lodash 3.

      Please inspect the changes to yarn.lock or package.json files to identify where
      the lodash 3 version is coming from and remove it.

      If you have questions about this please reack out to the operations team.
