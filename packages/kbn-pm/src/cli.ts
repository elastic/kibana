    By default commands are run for Kibana itself, all packages in the 'packages/'
    folder and for all plugins in './plugins' and '../kibana-extra'.

    Available commands:

       ${availableCommands.join('\n       ')}

    Global options:

       -e, --exclude          Exclude specified project. Can be specified multiple times to exclude multiple projects, e.g. '-e kibana -e @kbn/pm'.
       -i, --include          Include only specified projects. If left unspecified, it defaults to including all projects.
       --oss                  Do not include the x-pack when running command.
       --skip-kibana-plugins  Filter all plugins in ./plugins and ../kibana-extra when running command.
       --no-cache             Disable the bootstrap cache
