/**
 * Allows obtaining Agent factories, which can then be fed into elasticsearch-js's Client class.
 * Ideally, we should obtain one Agent factory for each ES Client class.
 * This allows using the same Agent across all the Pools and Connections of the Client (one per ES node).
 *
 * Agent instances are stored internally to allow collecting metrics (nbr of active/idle connections to ES).
 *
 * Using the same Agent factory across multiple ES Client instances is strongly discouraged, cause ES Client
 * exposes methods that can modify the underlying pools, effectively impacting the connections of other Clients.
