/**
 * API for accessing status of Core and this plugin's dependencies as well as for customizing this plugin's status.
 *
 * @remarks
 * By default, a plugin inherits it's current status from the most severe status level of any Core services and any
 * plugins that it depends on. This default status is available on the
 * {@link ServiceStatusSetup.derivedStatus$ | core.status.derviedStatus$} API.
 *
 * Plugins may customize their status calculation by calling the {@link ServiceStatusSetup.set | core.status.set} API
 * with an Observable. Within this Observable, a plugin may choose to only depend on the status of some of its
 * dependencies, to ignore severe status levels of particular Core services they are not concerned with, or to make its
 * status dependent on other external services.
 *
 * @example
 * Customize a plugin's status to only depend on the status of SavedObjects:
 * ```ts
 * core.status.set(
 *   core.status.core$.pipe(
 * .   map((coreStatus) => {
 *       return coreStatus.savedObjects;
 *     }) ;
 *   );
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * Customize a plugin's status to include an external service:
 * ```ts
 * const externalStatus$ = interval(1000).pipe(
 *   switchMap(async () => {
 *     const resp = await fetch(`https://myexternaldep.com/_healthz`);
 *     const body = await resp.json();
 *     if (body.ok) {
 *       return of({ level: ServiceStatusLevels.available, summary: 'External Service is up'});
 *     } else {
 *       return of({ level: ServiceStatusLevels.available, summary: 'External Service is unavailable'});
 *     }
 *   }),
 *   catchError((error) => {
 *     of({ level: ServiceStatusLevels.unavailable, summary: `External Service is down`, meta: { error }})
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * core.status.set(
 *   combineLatest([core.status.derivedStatus$, externalStatus$]).pipe(
 *     map(([derivedStatus, externalStatus]) => {
 *       if (externalStatus.level > derivedStatus) {
 *         return externalStatus;
 *       } else {
 *         return derivedStatus;
 *       }
 *     })
 *   )
 * );
 * ```
