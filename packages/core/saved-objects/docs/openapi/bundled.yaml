      summary: Rotate the encryption key for encrypted saved objects.
      operationId: rotateEncryptionKey
      description: |
        Superuser role required.

        If a saved object cannot be decrypted using the primary encryption key, then Kibana will attempt to decrypt it using the specified decryption-only keys. In most of the cases this overhead is negligible, but if you're dealing with a large number of saved objects and experiencing performance issues, you may want to rotate the encryption key.

        This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

          description: |
            Specifies a maximum number of saved objects that Kibana can process in a single batch. Bulk key rotation is an iterative process since Kibana may not be able to fetch and process all required saved objects in one go and splits processing into consequent batches. By default, the batch size is 10000, which is also a maximum allowed value.

                      NOTE: In most cases, `total` will be greater than `successful` even if `failed` is zero. The reason is that Kibana may not need or may not be able to rotate encryption keys for all encrypted saved objects.

            When true, force delete objects that exist in multiple namespaces. Note that the option applies to the whole request. Use the delete object API to specify per-object deletion behavior. TIP: Use this if you attempted to delete objects and received an HTTP 400 error with the following message: "Unable to delete saved object that exists in multiple namespaces, use the force option to delete it anyway". WARNING: When you bulk delete objects that exist in multiple namespaces, the API also deletes legacy url aliases that reference the object. These requests are batched to minimise the impact but they can place a heavy load on Kibana. Make sure you limit the number of objects that exist in multiple namespaces in a single bulk delete operation.

      description: |
        Under certain circumstances when Kibana is upgraded, saved object migrations may necessitate regenerating some object IDs to enable new features. When an object's ID is regenerated, a legacy URL alias is created for that object, preserving its old ID. In such a scenario, that object can be retrieved by the bulk resolve API using either its new ID or its old ID.

        The data that you want to create. WARNING: When you create saved objects, attributes are not validated, which allows you to pass arbitrary and ill-formed data into the API that can break Kibana. Make sure any data that you send to the API is properly formed.

      description: |
        Identifiers for the spaces in which this object is created. If this is provided, the object is created only in the explicitly defined spaces. If this is not provided, the object is created in the current space (default behavior). For shareable object types (registered with `namespaceType: 'multiple'`), this option can be used to specify one or more spaces, including the "All spaces" identifier ('*'). For isolated object types (registered with `namespaceType: 'single'` or `namespaceType: 'multiple-isolated'`), this option can only be used to specify a single space, and the "All spaces" identifier ('*') is not allowed. For global object types (`registered with `namespaceType: agnostic`), this option cannot be used.

        Objects with `name`, `id`, and `type` properties that describe the other saved objects that this object references. Use `name` in attributes to refer to the other saved object, but never the `id`, which can update automatically during migrations or import and export.
