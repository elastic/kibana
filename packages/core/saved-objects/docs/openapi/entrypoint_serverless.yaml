    description: |
      Export sets of saved objects that you want to import into Kibana, resolve import errors, and rotate an encryption key for encrypted saved objects with the saved objects APIs.

      To manage a specific type of saved object, use the corresponding APIs.
      For example, use:

      [Data views](../group/endpoint-data-views)

      Warning: Do not write documents directly to the `.kibana` index. When you write directly to the `.kibana` index, the data becomes corrupted and permanently breaks future Kibana versions.
