    description: |
      Export sets of saved objects that you want to import into {kib}, resolve import errors, and rotate an encryption key for encrypted saved objects with the saved objects APIs.
      
      To manage a specific type of saved object, use the corresponding APIs.
      For example, use:

      [Data views](../group/endpoint-data-views)

      Warning: Do not write documents directly to the `.kibana` index. When you write directly to the `.kibana` index, the data becomes corrupted and permanently breaks future Kibana versions.
