  summary: Retrieve multiple Kibana saved objects by identifier using any legacy URL aliases if they exist.
  operationId: bulkResolveSavedObjects
  deprecated: true
  description: >
    Under certain circumstances when Kibana is upgraded, saved object migrations may necessitate regenerating some object IDs to enable new features.
    When an object's ID is regenerated, a legacy URL alias is created for that object, preserving its old ID.
    In such a scenario, that object can be retrieved by the bulk resolve API using either its new ID or its old ID.
