  summary: Resolve errors from the Import objects API.
  operationId: resolveImportErrors
  description: |
    To resolve errors, you can:

    * Retry certain saved objects
    * Overwrite specific saved objects
    * Change references to different saved objects

    This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

        Applies various adjustments to the saved objects that are being imported to maintain compatibility between different Kibana versions. When enabled during the initial import, also enable when resolving import errors. This option cannot be used with the `createNewCopies` option.

                  Specifies the objects that failed to resolve.

                  NOTE: One object can result in multiple errors, which requires separate steps to resolve. For instance, a `missing_references` error and a `conflict` error.

                  NOTE: Objects are only created when all resolvable errors are addressed, including conflict and missing references.
