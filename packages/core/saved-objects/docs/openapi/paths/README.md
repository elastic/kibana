Paths
=====

Each path definition for which there is a specification exists within this folder.

These files currently use the following conventions:

* path separator token (e.g. `@`) is included in the file name
* path parameter (e.g. `{example}`) is included in the file name
* there is one file per path; each file can contain multiple operations
