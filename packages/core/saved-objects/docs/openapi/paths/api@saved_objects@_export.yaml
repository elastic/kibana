  summary: Retrieve sets of saved objects that you want to import into Kibana.
  operationId: exportSavedObjects
  description: |

    You must include `type` or `objects` in the request body.

    NOTE: The `savedObjects.maxImportExportSize` configuration setting limits the number of saved objects which may be exported.

    This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
