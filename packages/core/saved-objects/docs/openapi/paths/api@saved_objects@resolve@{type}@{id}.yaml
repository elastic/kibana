  summary: Retrieve a single Kibana saved object by identifier using any legacy URL alias if it exists.
  operationId: resolveSavedObject
  description: >
    Under certain circumstances, when Kibana is upgraded, saved object migrations may necessitate regenerating some object IDs to enable new features.
    When an object's ID is regenerated, a legacy URL alias is created for that object, preserving its old ID.
    In such a scenario, that object can be retrieved using either its new ID or its old ID.
