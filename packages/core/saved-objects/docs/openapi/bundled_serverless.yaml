                      NOTE: Objects are created only when all resolvable errors are addressed, including conflicts and missing references. If objects are created as new copies, each entry in the `successResults` array includes a `destinationId` attribute.

          description: |
            A file exported using the export API. NOTE: The `savedObjects.maxImportExportSize` configuration setting limits the number of saved objects which may be included in this file. Similarly, the `savedObjects.maxImportPayloadBytes` setting limits the overall size of the file that can be imported.

        success:

          description: |
            Indicates when the import was successfully completed. When set to false, some objects may not have been created. For additional information, refer to the `errors` and `successResults` properties.
        successCount:
          type: integer
          description: Indicates the number of successfully imported records.
        errors:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
          description: |
            Indicates the import was unsuccessful and specifies the objects that failed to import.

            NOTE: One object may result in multiple errors, which requires separate steps to resolve. For instance, a `missing_references` error and conflict error.
        successResults:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
          description: |
            Indicates the objects that are successfully imported, with any metadata if applicable.

            NOTE: Objects are created only when all resolvable errors are addressed, including conflicts and missing references. If objects are created as new copies, each entry in the `successResults` array includes a `destinationId` attribute.
