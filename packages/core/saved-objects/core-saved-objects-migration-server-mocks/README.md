# @kbn/core-saved-objects-migration-server-mocks

This package contains mocks for core's server-side savedObjects migration feature.
- mockKibanaMigrator
- migrationMocks

Note: the package is supposed to only be needed for core's internal testing, as all the mocks are for internal
Core components that are not publicly exposed.
