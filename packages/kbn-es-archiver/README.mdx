The ES Archiver is a service primarily used by the Functional Tests to load up ES indexes using the bulk API which makes the archives more resilient to ES upgrades and easier to inspect/edit locally because they are just plain text files containing newline-delimited JSON (though they are sometimes compressed).

## CLI

This tool also has a CLI which can be used to save indexes to new archives or load additional archives into a specific ES instance.

To teach the ES Archiver how to talk to ES and Kibana it is ideal to start ES and Kibana using `node scripts/functional_test_servers --config some/config/file.ts` and then use the same `--config` flag when running `node scripts/es_archiver` so that it can access the location and authorization information about the ES instace from the FTR config file.

Additional information about what functionality the CLI provides can be found by running `node scripts/es_archiver --help`
