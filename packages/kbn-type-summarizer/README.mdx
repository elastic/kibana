Consumes the .d.ts files produced by `tsc` for a package and generates a single `.d.ts` file of the public types along with a source map that points back to the original source.

## You mean like API Extractor?

Yeah, except with source map support and without all the legacy features and other features we disable to generate our current type summaries.

We first attempted to implement this in api-extractor but we hit a wall when dealing with the `Span` class. This class handles all the text output which ends up becoming source code, and I wasn't able to find a way to associate specific spans with source locations without getting 12 headaches. Instead I decided to try implementing this from scratch, reducing our reliance on the api-extractor project and putting us in control of how we generate type summaries.
