  /**
   * This method determines all the relevant metadata about the exports of
   * a specific `sourceFile` AST node. It indexes all the local declarations, imported
   * declarations, and ambient refs that should end up in the public type
   * summary file.
   *
   * To do this we use "symbols" from the `TypeChecker` provided by TypeScript.
   *
   *  > "symbols" in the `TypeChecker` are not related to `Symbol`s in JS.
   *
   * Symbols describe a specific sourceFile/Type/Value in the source code, and allow
   * us to understand the types referenced by specific AST nodes. For instance, we
   * can ask the `TypeChecker` for the symbol of an `Identifier` node in the AST (the
   * node type representing most named "keywords"; `a` and `foo` in `a(foo)` are both
   * `Identifiers`). Every identifier in the source code should map to a specific symbol
   * in the type system, which would be returned by the `TypeChecker`. These symbols
   * then list the "declarations" which define/declare them. This is often a `class {}`
   * or `interface {}` declaration but there are many types of declarations that could
   * have defined this symbol. Additionally, the symbol may have multiple declarations
   * if function overloads or interface extensions are used.
   *
   * Symbols can be "alias" symbols, indicating that they are declared in the source code
   * but actually point to another declaration, either by variable assignment or via
   * imports. When a type/value is imported from another file, the references to that
   * type/value use alias symbols, which are declared by the import itself but point
   * elsewhere. Thankfully, the `TypeChecker` has an API to traverse up the alias chain
   * to the "root symbol". While indexing exports we regularly use the `SymbolResolver`
   * to convert a symbol to it's `rootSymbol`, so that we can compare two references and
   * determine if they are pointing to the same underlying declarations/type/value.
   *
   * To determine the full index of exports for a source file we start by asking the
   * TypeChecker for the list of exported symbols of some sourceFile, then we traverse
   * from those symbols to their declarations. If the symbol has declarations that are
   * in node_modules, then either an `ImportedDecs` or `AmbientRef` object is added to
   * the index, depending on wether the symbol is ever found to be imported.
   *
   *    `ImportedDecs` describe how to import the declarations for that exported
   *        symbol in the type summary file.
   *    `AmbientRef` objects describe names that are expected to be declared ambiently,
   *        and therefore should be considered reserved in the type summary file.
   *
   * If any declarations for an exported symbol are local to the source code then they will
   * result in a `LocalDecs` object being added to the index. Before adding a `LocalDecs`
   * object to the index the AST of each local declaration is traversed to find
   * references to other symbols. These references cause additional `ImportedDecs`,
   * `AmbientRef`, or `LocalDecs` objects to be added to the index before the exported
   * `LocalDecs`, ensuring that referenced declarations come first in the resulting type
   * summary file and that all code referenced by the decalarations is included in the type
   * summary file.
   *
   * Once all referenced declarations are found and added to the index the exported
   * `LocalDecs` object is added to the index and the process is repeated for the next exported
   * symbol.
   *
   * To ensure that we don't end up with duplicate declarations all `LocalDecs`, `ImportedDecs`
   * and `AmbientRef` objects track the "root symbol" that they represent. Any time we
   * encounter a new symbol which might need to be added to the index it is first resolved
   * to it's root symbol to ensure we haven't already handled it.
