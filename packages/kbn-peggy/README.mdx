This package wraps the peggy package, exposing a synchronous and async version of the generator which includes two modifications:

 1. When a `path` is provided a `${basename}.config.json` file will be loaded if it exists and is expected to include peggy config options as defined in [the peggy docs](https://peggyjs.org/documentation.html#generating-a-parser-javascript-api). This config will be used when compiling this file

## Plugins
These types will automatically be included for plugins.

## Packages

To include these types in a package add `"@kbn/ambient-ui-types"` to the `types` portion of the `tsconfig.json` file.
