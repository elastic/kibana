### Typescript issues

If you run into some really head-scratching Typescript errors, and are starting to question your sanity, try to run `git clean` to restore your repository to a totally fresh state. Sometimes the Typescript caches can get mixed up when switching branches and show errors that are totally wrong.

```
git clean -fdxn -e /config -e /.vscode
```
