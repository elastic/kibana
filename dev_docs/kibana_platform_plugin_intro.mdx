From an end user perspective, Kibana is a tool for interacting with Elasticsearch, providing an easy way 
to visualize and analyze data.

From a developer perspective, Kibana is a platform that provides a set of tools to build not only the UI you see in Kibana today, but
a wide variety of applications that can be used to explore, visualize, and act upon data in Elasticsearch. The platform provides developers the ability 
to build applications, or inject extra functionality into 
already existing applications. Did you know that almost everything you see in the
Kibana UI is built inside a plugin? If you removed all plugins from Kibana, you'd be left with an empty navigation menu, and a set of
developer tools. The Kibana platform is a blank canvas, just waiting for a developer to come along and create something!

## Platform services

Plugins have access to three kinds of public services:

 - Platform services provided by `core` (<DocLink id="kibPlatformIntro" section="core-services" text="Core services"/>)
 - Platform services provided by plugins (<DocLink id="kibPlatformIntro" section="platform-plugins" text="Platform plugins"/>)
 - Shared services provided by plugins, that are only relevant for only a few, specific plugins (e.g. "presentation utils"). 

 The first two items are what make up "Platform services".

<DocCallOut title="What is the difference between services provided by platform plugins, and those by core?">

We try to put only the most stable and fundamental code into `Core`, while more application focused functionality goes in a plugin, but the heuristic isn't
clear, and we haven't done a great job of sticking to it. For example, notifications and toasts are core services, but data and search are plugin services.

Today it looks something like this.

<DocAccordion buttonContent="A bit of history">
When the Kibana platform and plugin infrastructure was built, we thought of two types of code: core services, and other plugin services. We planned to keep the most stable and fundamental 
code needed to build plugins inside core.

In reality, we ended up with many platform-like services living outside of core, with no (short term) intention of moving them. We highly encourage plugin developers to use
them, so we consider them part of platform services.

When we built our platform system, we also thought we'd end up with only a handful of large plugins outside core. Users could turn certain plugins off, to minimize the code
 footprint and speed up Kibana.

In reality, our plugin model ended up being used like micro-services. Plugins are the only form of encapsulation we provide developers, and they liked it! However, we ended
 up with a ton of small plugins, that developers never intended to be uninstallable, nor tested in this manner. We are considering ways to provide developers the ability to build services
 with the encapsulation
 they desire, without the need to build a plugin.

Another side effect of having many small plugins is that common code often ends up extracted into another plugin. Use case specific utilities are exported,
 that are not meant to be used in a general manner. This makes our definition of "platform code" a bit trickier to define. We'd like to say "The platform is made up of 
 every publically exposed service", but in today's world, that wouldn't be a very accurate picture.

We recognize the need to better clarify the relationship between core functionality, platform-like plugin functionality, and functionality exposed by other plugins.
 It's something we will be working on!

We will continue to focus on adding clarity around these types of services and what developers can expect from each.

### Core services

Sometimes referred to just as Core, Core services provide the most basic and fundamental tools neccessary for building a plugin, like creating saved objects,
routing, application registration, and notifications. The Core platform is not a plugin itself, although
there are some plugins that provide platform functionality. We call these <DocLink id="kibPlatformIntro" section="platform-plugins" text="Platform plugins"/>.

### Platform plugins

Plugins that provide fundamental services and functionality to extend and customize Kibana, for example, the 
<DocLink id="kibDataPlugin" text="data"/> plugin. There is no official way to tell if a plugin is a platform plugin or not.
Platform plugins are _usually_ plugins that are managed by the Platform Group, but we are starting to see some exceptions.

## Plugins

Plugins are code that is written to extend and customize Kibana. Plugin's don't have to be part of the Kibana repo, though the Kibana 
repo does contain many plugins! Plugins add customizations by 
using <DocLink id="kibPlatformIntro" section="extension-points" text="extension points"/> provided by <DocLink id="kibPlatformIntro" section="platform-services" text="platform services"/>.
Sometimes people confuse the term "plugin" and "application". While often there is a 1:1 relationship between a plugin and an application, it is not always the case.
A plugin may register many applications, or none.

### Applications

Applications are top level pages in the Kibana UI. Dashboard, Canvas, Maps, App Search, etc, are all examples of applications:

![applications in kibana](./assets/applications.png)

A plugin can register an application by
adding it to core's application <DocLink id="kibPlatformIntro" section="registry" text="registry"/>.

### Public plugin API

A plugin's public API consists of everything exported from a plugin's <DocLink id="kibPlatformIntro" section="plugin-lifecycle" text="start or setup lifecycle methods"/>, 
as well as from the top level `index.ts` files that exist in the three "scope" folders:

- common/index.ts
- public/index.ts
- server/index.ts

Any plugin that exports something from those files, or from the lifecycle methods, is exposing a public service. We sometimes call these things "plugin services" or
"shared services".

## Lifecycle methods

Core, and plugins, expose different features at different parts of their lifecycle. We describe the lifecycle of core services and plugins with
 specifically-named functions on the service definition.

Kibana has three lifecycles: setup, start, and stop. Each pluginâ€™s setup function is called sequentially while Kibana is setting up
 on the server or when it is being loaded in the browser. The start functions are called sequentially after setup has been completed for all plugins. 
 The stop functions are called sequentially while Kibana is gracefully shutting down the server or when the browser tab or window is being closed.

The table below explains how each lifecycle relates to the state of Kibana.

| lifecycle	| purpose |	server |	browser |
| ---------- | ------ | ------- | ----- |
| setup | perform "registration" work to setup environment for runtime |configure REST API endpoint, register saved object types, etc. | configure application routes in SPA, register custom UI elements in extension points, etc. |
| start | bootstrap runtime logic | respond to an incoming request, request Elasticsearch server, etc. | start polling Kibana server, update DOM tree in response to user interactions, etc.| 
| stop | cleanup runtime | dispose of active handles before the server shutdown. | store session data in the LocalStorage when the user navigates away from Kibana, etc. |

Different service interfaces can and will be passed to setup, start, and stop because certain functionality makes sense in the context of a running plugin while other types 
of functionality may have restrictions or may only make sense in the context of a plugin that is stopping.

## Extension points

An extension point is a function provided by core, or a plugin's plugin API, that can be used by other
plugins to customize the Kibana experience. Examples of extension points are:

- core.application.register (The extension point talked about above)
- core.notifications.toasts.addSuccess
- core.overlays.showModal
- embeddables.registerEmbeddableFactory
- uiActions.registerAction
- core.saedObjects.registerType
