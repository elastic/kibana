Welcome to Kibana's plugin developer documentation!

Did you know that the vast majority of functionality built inside of Kibana is a plugin? A handful of core services hold the system together,
but it's our vast system of plugin developers that provide the amazing, out of the box, functionality you can use when building your own set of
custom utilities and applications.

Browse the `Services` section to view all the plugins that offer functionality you can take advantage of, or check out the
`API documentation` to dig into the nitty gritty details of every public plugin API.
