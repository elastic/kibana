Understanding `LensTreeMapConfig` in detail

## Required Properties

### `chartType`

- **Type:** Fixed value `'treemap'`
- **Description:** Sets the chart type to treemap. Treemaps are used to visualize hierarchical data using nested rectangles. Each branch of the tree is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub-branches. A leaf node's size and color can vary to show statistical information about the node and its relationship to the rest of the tree.

### `title`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** The title of the visualization.

<Dataset />

### `breakdown`

- **Type:** `LensBreakdownConfig[]`
- **Description:** An array of breakdown configurations to hierarchically segment the data into nested rectangles. The breakdowns determine how the data is grouped and subdivided, with each level of the hierarchy represented by a deeper level of nesting in the treemap. Check breakdown configuration details below.

<Breakdown />

## Optional Properties

## Example

```
const treemapConfig: LensConfig = {
  chartType: 'treemap',
  title: 'Sales Distribution by Product Category',
  dataset: {
    esql: 'from sales_data | group by category, subCategory | stats sum(sales) as totalSales',
  },
  breakdown: [
    {
      type: 'topValues',
      field: 'category',
      size: 5, // Top 5 categories
    },
    {
      type: 'topValues',
      field: 'subCategory',
      size: 10, // Top 10 subcategories within each category
    },
  ],
};
const configBuilder = new LensConfigBuilder(lensFormulaAPI, dataViewsAPI);
const lensConfig = configBuilder.build(treemapConfig, {
  timeRange: { from: 'now-1y', to: 'now', type: 'relative' },
  embeddable: true,
});
```

This example demonstrates how to create a treemap visualization to display sales distribution across different product categories and their subcategories. The `breakdown` property is configured with two levels of `topValues` breakdowns to first segment the data by the top 5 categories and then further by the top 10 subcategories within each category. An ESQL query aggregates sales totals at these levels, enabling the treemap to visually represent the distribution of sales across the product hierarchy. The visualization title, "Sales Distribution by Product Category," provides a clear description of what the treemap represents, facilitating easy interpretation of the hierarchical data structure and the relative significance of each segment.
