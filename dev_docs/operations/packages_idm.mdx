## Summary

The size of the Kibana repository has surpassed almost all other Typescript projects on Github, and the Javascript tooling ecosystem is inadequate. AppEx Operations team has done a lot of work over the years to close these gaps and keep up with our codebase's growth. Still, significant steps are necessary to provide a more efficient development experience. The AppEx Operations team is leading an effort to migrate to Bazel, which among other things, will provide remote caching and incremental builds. This initiative should drastically improve the productivity of Kibana contributors by minimizing what needs to be built, both locally and in CI, and providing faster and more thorough feedback.

## Goals

- Use packages as a core unit of code used throughout the repository
- Packages have well defined boundaries, a single responsibility, and are easily reusable and shareable across the repository when desired
- Support organizing the repository by domain
- Allow developers and CI to benefit from a remote cache and incremental builds for all development/validation/build tasks

## Definitions

These are some of the terms we are using to describe parts of this initiative:

Build Tasks/Tasks
: We refer to any task/command that is executed as part of developement or CI as a "build task" or just "task"

Package
: Packages can be installed from NPM, or implemented in the repository. Local packages are structured in a specific way detailed in the [Package Structure](#package-structure) section.

Incremental tasks
: The ability to execute the minimal set of build tasks necessary by inspecting the files which have changed and utilizing local+remote caches

## Package Structure

Every package has:
  - a globally unique module ID in the `@kbn/` namespace
  - a type, see [Package Types](#package-types)
  - dependencies on other packages in the repo or from NPM declared in their `kibana.jsonc` file and updated automatically
  - configuration files like `BUILD.bazel`, `jest.config.js`, `package.json`, etc. which are automatically generated when necessary from the `kibana.jsonc` file.
  - a single interface. When you import a package you get it's one and only interface. Packages don't have sub-imports, or sub-modules.
  - the ability to include jest tests alongside the code

## Package Types

Every package is of one of the following types. Using package types allows us to have many different packages and pre-defined build tasks, restrictions, and unique config for each package type. There is currently a proposal to add a new `test-helpers` package type, and we expect more package types to be defined in the future.

`shared-common`
: These packages can be imported from all other packages.

`shared-browser`
: These packages can be imported from `shared-browser` and `plugin-browser` packages. Storybooks may be included in package of type `shared-browser`.

`shared-server`
: These packages can be imported from `shared-server` and `plugin-server` packages.

`shared-scss`
: These packages can be imported by `shared-browser` and `plugin-browser` packages. Instead of an `index.ts` file these pacakges have an `index.scss` file which will be exposed to consumers of this package.

`plugin-browser`
: These packages expose types to other packages via a root `types.ts` file, `import type` statements must be used when importing. Module IDs must end with `-plugin-browser`.

`plugin-server`
: These packages expose types to other packages via a root `types.ts` file, `import type` statements must be used when importing. Module IDs must end with `-plugin-server`.

`functional-test`
: These packages can not be imported by other packages and expose one or more functional testing configurations, including API integration tests. Having this separate means that iterating on functional tests will not need to rebuild the application and updating the application will usually not rebuild the tests.


## Phases

We're planning to implement the full package system described in phases. Currently, those phases look like this:

### Phase 1: Ground preparation

**status:** âœ… complete

This phase is about identifying issues that would prevent a migration for teams in order to provide adequate time for them before they have the need to migrate.

 - Migrate all plugins to use module IDs
 - Find instances of ESLint being disabled and illegal cross-boundary imports are used; create issues for teams to address
 - Prevent naked eslint-disable
 - Prevent disabling specific ESLint rules
 - Windows development is not supported
 - Rewrite @kbn/pm using native Node.js to remove its build step. Anything outside of bootstrap like clean and reset commands will move to different packages.
 - Document how to break up packages into smaller pieces

### Phase 2: Legacy packages migration

**status:** in progress

This phase is about migrating the existing legacy packages to one of the [package types](#package-types).

  - Add kibana.json files to existing packages
  - Auto generating configuration files based on the `kibana.jsonc` manifest
  - Discover dependencies used in packages automatically

### Phase 3: Double down on DX

This phase is all about making it easier for teams to start breaking their plugin up into packages.

  - Rebuilding packages when running the Kibana Development CLI is automatic
  - Pause requests when packages are being re-built
  - Ensure the server restarts when files in a shared-server package are rebuilt
  - Package linting to validate rules
  - Start with a package rule to validate dependencies are all used and included
  - Document how to create, build and watch packages.

### Phase 4: Plugins everywhere

This phase is all about supporting the creation of plugin-browser and plugin-server packages anywhere in the repository.

  - Extracting Webpack config from @kbn/optimizer to work on a single bundle inside Bazel
  - Update plugin discovery to find and differentiate between legacy plugins and plugin-browser/server packages
  - ESLint rules to validate imports into and out of plugin-browser and plugin-server packages
  - Finish the migration of core to packages and reflect with the core team (and possibly the Shared UX team) around what we should recommend for plugin authors before we start to migrate legacy plugins to the package system
  - Documentation, documentation, documentation
  - How do 3rd party plugins migrate to the new system?

### Phase 5: Legacy plugins migration

This phase is all about having the solution teams migrating their legacy plugins into packages.

  - Identify the order of plugins that can be migrated
  - Identify and communicate what needs to be done by teams
  - Provide migration consultations
  - Deprecate legacy 3rd party plugin styles and communicate 18 month migration period

### Phase 6: Cleanup

This phase is about finalizing the rough edges and making sure every piece of code is on Bazel.

  - No code lives outside a Bazel package
  - Extend the package development tooling to support 3rd party package development and allow packages to participate in the benefits of Bazel within the `plugins` directory.
  - Ability for 3rd party packages to require specific versions of specific packages from NPM
  - Automatically build the components that need changes
  - Build package artifacts that can be installed in Kibana distributables


## FAQ

### Is it time for me to start creating packages?

Probably not. The Shared UX and Core teams are currently our Guinea Pig teams and they're experiencing the pain of living on the bleeding edge. If you want to create a single package you are welcome to, but for now it's probably best that you wait until Operations reached out to your team.

### How do circular dependencies work?

By breaking the repository into packages we not be able to support cross-package circular dependency.

Imagine trying to build the types for `@kbn/a`, which depend on the types for `@kbn/b`. If `@kbn/b` also depends on the types for `@kbn/a` there is no way to build the types for eather package because they form a circular dependency.

If you cause a circular dependency in the task graph Bazel will produce a pretty great error message explaining where the cycle is.

So far, the solution to resolving circular dependencies has always been to break out some component which is causing the circular dependency into a separate package. Packages are light weight, and are very easy to create ([work in progress][status]) so please feel comfortable creating more packages.

### How do we name packages?

There are a few package naming rules:
 - all packages must use the `@kbn/` namespace
 - `plugin-browser` packages must end with `-plugin-browser`
 - `plugin-server` packages must end with `-plugin-server`
 - be considerate of the fact that we are operating in a global namespace and avoid overly generic names

Other than these rules, it's up to you what the best name for your package is.

<DocCallOut color="primary">
  Keep the single responsibility principle in mind, if there isn't a clear name for your package it might mean that it includes too many things and should be split into multiple smaller packages with explicit purposes.
</DocCallOut>

The shared-ux team makes a lot of packages containing a single component which is widely shared and provides a lot of helpers and types for other packages to consume, the shared-ux team has used the following naming scheme:

```
/{domain}/{componentName}
  impl/  :: `@kbn/shared-ux-{domain}-{componentName}`
  mocks/ :: `@kbn/shared-ux-{domain}-{componentName}-mocks`
  types/ :: `@kbn/shared-ux-{domain}-{componentName}-types`
```

The `@kbn/{team}-{domain}-{component}(-{type})?` style naming scheme is also followed by the core team in their packages:

 - `@kbn/core-analytics-browser`
 - `@kbn/core-analytics-browser-internal`
 - `@kbn/core-analytics-browser-mocks`
 - `@kbn/core-analytics-server`
 - `@kbn/core-analytics-server-mocks`
 - `@kbn/core-analytics-server-internal`
 - etc.

### Where do I put my package?

The only rule the package system enforces is that packages can't live inside of other packages. Additionally, for licensing purposes it's probably best to keep SSPL licensed code in the `packages` or `src` directories and Elastic licensed code in the `x-pack` directory.

Otherise, you can put your packages wherever you like. It's probably best that you don't put them in the current `packages` directory as it's huge and only getting bigger with time.

To define a new directory where packages will live you will need to edit the [`BAZEL_PACKAGE_DIRS`][pkgDirs] const. This list points to all the directories where packages can live in the repository and includes the current list of locations where packages are being created.

### What works now?

Today we have a basic package generator that produces legacy package definitions. We're done laying the groundwork now and have both the Core and Shared UX teams playing guinea pig. You can use the legacy package generator with `node scripts/generate package` and create a package, but it's not the right time for more teams to start migrating large portions of their code to packages.

We're now entering Phase 2 of the plan, more details about the phases of our plan can be found [above](#phases)
