When building a plugin in Kibana, there are a handful of architectural "building blocks" you can use. Some of these building blocks are "higher-level", 
and some are "lower-level". High-level building blocks come 
with many built-in capabilities, require less maintenance, and evolve new feature sets over time with little to no
 impact on consumers. When developers use high-level building blocks, new features are exposed consistently, across all of Kibana, at the same time.
  On the downside, they are not as flexible as our low-level building blocks. 
 
 Low-level building blocks
 provide greater flexibility, but require more code to stitch them together into a meaningful UX. This results in higher maintenance cost for consumers and greater UI/UX variability
 across Kibana.

 For example, if an application is using <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="index-patterns" text="Index Patterns"/> and 
 <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="search-source" text="Search Source"/>, 
 their application would automatically support runtime fields. If the app is instead using the
 lower-level <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="search-strategy" text="Search Strategy"/>, additional work would be required.

Armed with this knowledge, you can choose what works best for your use case!

# Application building blocks

## UI components

The following high-level building blocks can be rendered directly into your application UI.

### Query Bar

The <DocLink id="kibDataPlugin" text="Data plugin"/> provides a high-level Query Bar component that comes with support for Lucene, KQL, Saved Queries, 
and <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="index-patterns" text="Index Patterns"/>.

If you would like to expose the ability to search and filter on Elasticsearch data, the Query Bar provided by the
<DocLink id="kibDataPlugin" text="Data plugin"/> 
 is your go-to building block.

### Dashboard Embeddable

Add a Dashboard Embeddable directly inside your application to provide users with a set of visualizations and graphs that work seamlessly
with the <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="query-bar" text="Query Bar"/>. Every feature that is added to a registered 
<DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="embeddables" text="Embeddable"/> 
(Lens, Maps, Saved Searches and more) will be available automatically, as well as any
 <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="ui-actions--triggers" text="UI Actions"/> that are
 added to the Embeddable context menu panel (for example, drilldowns, custom panel time ranges, and "share to" features).

The Dashboard Embeddable is one of the highest-level UI components you can add to your application.

**Github labels**: `Team:Presentation`, `Feature:Dashboard`

### Lens Embeddable

Check out the Lens Embeddable if you wish to show users visualizations based on Elasticsearch data without worrying about query building and chart rendering. It's built on top of the
 <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="expressions" text="Expression language"/>, and integrates with
  <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="index-patterns" text="Index Patterns"/>
 and <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="ui-actions--triggers" text="UI Actions"/>. Using the same configuration, it's also possible to link to
 a prefilled Lens editor, allowing the user to drill deeper and explore their data.

### Map Embeddable

Check out the Map Embeddable if you wish to embed a map in your application.

**Github labels**: `Team:Geo`

### KibanaPageTemplate

All Kibana pages should use KibanaPageTemplate to setup their pages. It's a thin wrapper around [EuiPageTemplate](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/layout/page) that makes setting up common types of Kibana pages quicker and easier while also adhering to any Kibana-specific requirements.

## Searching

### Index Patterns

<DocLink id="kibDataPlugin" section="index-patterns-api" text="Index Patterns"/> are a high-level, space-aware abstraction layer that sits 
above Data Streams and Elasticsearch indices. Index Patterns provide users the 
ability to define and customize the data they wish to search and filter on, on a per-space basis. For example, users can specify a set of indices, 
and they can customize the field list with runtime fields, formatting options and custom labels.

Index Patterns are used in many other high-level building blocks so we highly recommend you consider this building block for your search needs.

**Github labels**: `Team:AppServices`, `Feature:Index Patterns`

### Search Source

<DocLink id="kibDataPlugin" section="searchsource" text="Search Source"/> is a high-level search service offered by the
<DocLink id="kibDataPlugin" section="searchsource" text="Data plugin"/>. It requires an
<DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="index-patterns" text="Index Pattern"/>, and abstracts away the raw ES DSL and search endpoint. Internally
it uses the ES <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="search-strategies" text="Search Strategy"/>. Use Search Source if you need to query data 
from Elasticsearch, and you aren't already using one of the high-level UI Components that handles this internally.

**Github labels**: `Team:AppServices`, `Feature:Search`

### Search Strategies

Search Strategies are a low-level building block that abstracts away search details, like what REST endpoint is being called. The ES Search Strategy 
is a very lightweight abstraction layer that sits just above querying ES with the elasticsearch-js client. Other search stragies are offered for other 
languages, like EQL and SQL. These are very low-level building blocks so expect a lot of glue work to make these work with the higher-level abstractions.

**Github labels**: `Team:AppServices`, `Feature:Search`

### Expressions

Expressions are a low-level building block that can be used if you have advanced search needs that requiring piping results into additional functionality, like
joining and manipulating data. Lens and Canvas are built on top of Expressions. Most developers should be able to use
 <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="lens-embeddable" text="Lens"/> or
  <DocLink id="kibBuildingBlocks" section="search-source" text="Search Source"/>, rather than need to access the Expression language directly.  

**Github labels**: `Team:AppServices`, `Feature:ExpressionLanguage`

## Saved Objects

<DocLink id="kibDevDocsSavedObjectsIntro" text="Saved Objects" /> should be used if you need to persist application-level information. If you were building a TODO
application, each TODO item would be a `Saved Object`. Saved objects come pre-wired with support for bulk export/import, security features like space sharing and
space isolation, and tags.

**Github labels**: `Team:Core`, `Feature:Saved Objects`

# Integration building blocks

Use the following building blocks to create an inter-connected, cross-application, holistic Kibana experience. These building blocks allow you to expose functionality
 that promotes your own application into other applications, as well as help developers of other applications integrate into your app.

## UI Actions & Triggers

Integrate custom actions into other applications by registering UI Actions attached to existing triggers. For example, the Maps
application could register a UI Action called "View in Maps" to appear any time the user clicked a geo field to filter on.

**Github labels**: `Team:AppServices`, `Feature:UIActions`

## Embeddables

Embeddables help you integrate your application with the Dashboard application. Register your custom UI Widget as an Embeddable and users will
be able to add it as a panel on a Dashboard. With a little extra work, it can also be exposed in Canvas workpads.
