## Adding dependencies

Looking for a dependency that isn't already available in Kibana? There are a few things to keep in mind before adding a new dependency.

First, be sure you have read and are familiar with our <DocLink id="kibDevPrinciples" />. In particular, **Be wary of dependencies**
and **Prefer one way to do things** provide an overview of how we approach this question.

In general, we have a bias toward **not** adding new dependencies unless there is a compelling reason to do so, as we want to
minimize Kibana's overall complexity.

Should you find yourself evaluating a new dependency, here are some specific things to ask yourself:

1. **Is there already another dependency that offers similar functionality?** If so, adding a new dependency may not be necessary.
Prefer one way to do things and use what's already there, unless there is an important reason not to do so.
2. **Does this dependency appear to be well-maintained?** A dependency that hasn't been updated in years is usually more of a
liability than an asset. Make sure the depedency has recent activity, that bugs and security vulnerabilities appear to be addressed
in a timely manner, and that there is active participation from the maintainers and community.
3. **How large is the dependency?** For client-side plugins, heavy dependencies can have a real impact on user experience,
especially if they are included in the initial page bundle and not loaded asynchronously. In some cases it might make more sense
to roll your own rather than include a bloated depedency, especially if you are only using a single piece of functionality.
4. **Does this dependency have a license that's compatible with Kibana's?** Most common open source licenses such as BSD, MIT,
and Apache 2.0/1.1 are okay to use with Kibana. Others may not be, or may require special attribution.
5. **Will this dependency need to be prebuilt?** Due to our build process, native module dependencies should include at least a prebuild
step so at install time it simply downloads instead of building from source. This allows us to optimize bootstrap times.
6. **Am I committed to maintaining this dependency?** Once you add a dependency to the `package.json`, someone else isn't going to
keep it updated for you. That means you will be responsible for updating it regularly, keeping an eye out for security vulnerabilities,
and dealing with any breaking changes that may arise during an upgrade. We recommend relying on the renovate bot to help keep the
dependency updated; be sure to mark your ownership of the package in the
[`renovate.json`](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/renovate.json`) file.
