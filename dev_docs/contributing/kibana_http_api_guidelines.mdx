Kibana's HTTP APIs are the foundation for developers, partners, and customers to build powerful extensions, automations, and integrations with Kibana.

These guidelines provide a set of best practices for designing HTTP APIs in Kibana that are consistent, predictable, and easy to use. Whether you're building new APIs or enhancing existing ones, following these guidelines will help ensure that your APIs integrate seamlessly with the rest of the Kibana ecosystem and provide a great developer experience.

For specific guidance on making your APIs Terraform-friendly, refer to the [Guidelines for Terraform friendly HTTP APIs](/kibana-dev-docs/contributing/http-api-tf-guidelines).
