---

Kibana's role has expanded beyond the UI. APIs have become the backbone for how customers automate their workflows, build custom scripts, and create their own integrations. With GitOps becoming the standard and Terraform establishing itself as the go-to infrastructure-as-code tool, HTTP APIs are now business-critical. The rise in Search AI means that it's more important than ever to make sure our APIs are easily understood by LLMs.

For Terraform to be a first class citizen, the provider needs to cover resources that weren't available before—think Dashboards, Visualizations, Data Views, and Detection Rules. This means we need to build REST APIs that follow the OpenAPI Specification properly, making it straightforward for teams to manage these resources as code through GitOps workflows.

These guidelines will help you build APIs that are easy to use, whether someone's automating with scripts or managing infrastructure at scale.

## Terraform provider developer-friendly API design

Terraform can work with any API, but some APIs are easier to deal with than others. Here are some tips to make your API more Terraform provider-friendly:

### Think in terms of resources

APIs that stick to a consistent set of arguments or parameters are much easier to map into Terraform. Terraform can describe the "thing" your API is managing. RPC-based APIs are harder to work with since they’re not declarative. Your HTTP APIs should describe REST-like actions (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.) against resources not remote procedures like: executeJob.

APIs designed around resources are easier to support than those focused on action-oriented endpoints.

✅ Preferred: REST-like actions against resources

```
GET    /api/alerting/rule/{id}     # Kibana Alerting API
POST   /api/alerting/rule/{id}     # Create rule
PUT    /api/alerting/rule/{id}     # Update rule
DELETE /api/alerting/rule/{id}     # Delete rule
```

⚠️ Alternative: action-style endpoints

```
POST /api/executeJob
POST /api/processSpaceUpdate
POST /api/triggerIndexRebalance
```

#### Example

The [Index Lifecycle Management API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-ilm-put-lifecycle) (PUT /\_ilm/policy/\{policy\}) declaratively defines the desired lifecycle state rather than imperatively executing phase transitions:

```
PUT _ilm/policy/my_ilm_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "_meta": {
      "description": "used for nginx log",
      "project": {
        "name": "myProject",
        "department": "myDepartment"
      }
    },
    "phases": {
      "warm": {
        "min_age": "10d",
        "actions": {
          "forcemerge": {
            "max_num_segments": 1
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "30d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

[Corresponding resource configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/elasticstack/latest/docs/resources/elasticsearch_index_lifecycle)

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_lifecycle" "my_ilm" {
  name = "my_ilm_policy"

  warm {
    min_age = "10d"
    forcemerge {
      "max_num_segments": 1
    }
  }

  delete {
    min_age = "30d"
    delete {}
  }
}
```

### Implement complete CRUD operations

For Terraform to properly manage resources, your API must implement a complete set of CRUD operations on each resource. This is essential for the Terraform lifecycle (create, read, update, delete) to work properly.

#### Required endpoints for each resource

For every resource type, implement these HTTP endpoints:

```
GET    /api/resource/{id}         # Read - retrieve an existing resource
POST   /api/resource              # Create - create a new resource
PUT    /api/resource/{id}         # Update - update an existing resource
DELETE /api/resource/{id}         # Delete - remove an existing resource
GET    /api/resource              # List - retrieve all resources (with pagination)
```

<DocCallOut title="Terraform import">
  The "List" operation is critical for Terraform's data source and import functionality ([see the docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import)).
</DocCallOut>

#### Implementation considerations

1. **Consistent response structures**: Ensure GET and POST/PUT responses return the same structure with identical fields.

2. **Idempotent operations**: POST for creation and PUT for updates should be idempotent - running the same request multiple times should result in the same state. This is related to read/GETs without side-effects.

3. **Complete state**: After each operation, return the complete state of the resource, not just acknowledgment.

   ```json
   // Good - returns complete state
   {
     "id": "my-resource", // it is best to call this field "id"
     "name": "My Resource",
     "config": { "setting1": "value1" },
     "created_at": "2025-06-24T08:15:30Z",
     "updated_at": "2025-06-24T08:15:30Z"
   }

   // Bad - returns only acknowledgment
   {
     "result": "success",
     "message": "Resource created successfully"
   }
   ```

4. **HTTP status codes**: Use appropriate HTTP status codes:
   - `200/201` for successful operations
   - `404` when a resource doesn't exist
   - `409` for conflicts (e.g., resource already exists)
   - `400` for validation errors

5. **Validation**: Validate input at creation/update time and return comprehensive errors.

#### Example: Complete API for a resource

```typescript
// Retrieve 1 resource
router.get(
  {
    path: '/api/resource/{id}',
    validate: false, // `get` should not have bodies
  },
  async (context, request, response) => {
    // Implementation...
    return response.ok({ body: completeResourceState });
  }
);

// Create, update
router.(post|put)(
  {
    path: '/api/resource',
    validate: {
      body: schema.object({
        name: schema.string(),
        config: schema.object({...}),
      }),
    },
  },
  async (context, request, response) => {
    // Implementation...
    return response.ok({ body: completeResourceState });
  }
);

// Delete
router.delete(
  {
    path: '/api/resource/{id}',
    validate: {
      params: schema.object({
        id: schema.string(),
      }),
    },
  },
  async (context, request, response) => {
    // Implementation...
    return response.ok();
  }
);

// List many resources
router.get(
  {
    path: '/api/resource',
    validate: {
      query: schema.object({
        page: schema.maybe(schema.number()),
        perPage: schema.maybe(schema.number()),
      }),
    },
  },
  async (context, request, response) => {
    // Implementation...
    return response.ok({
      body: {
        items: resources,
        total: totalCount,
        page: currentPage,
        perPage: itemsPerPage
      }
    });
  }
);
```

#### API imposed challenges

API design decisions can create real challenges for Terraform resource implementation. The Elasticsearch [Index Settings API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-settings) (\`PUT /\{index\}/\_settings\`) treats static settings (which require index recreation) and dynamic settings (which can be updated in place) identically. This creates a complex situation forcing the implementation to handle all settings together because the API doesn't offer a way to distinguish them upfront.

```bash
{
  "error": {
    "reason": "Can't update non dynamic settings [[index.codec, index.number_of_shards]] for open indices"
}
```

[Index settings update bug](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-elasticstack/issues/52)

A better API design would separate these concerns with different endpoints or provide metadata about which settings require recreation.

### Handle resource references and dependencies

Terraform configurations frequently define multiple resources that depend on each other. Your API design needs to account for these interdependencies in a way that enables Terraform's declarative model to work smoothly.

#### Use stable, predictable resource identifiers

Resource references must use identifiers that remain stable throughout a resource's lifecycle and across operations:

```json
// Resource reference using stable ID
{
  "name": "My Report",
  "space_id": "marketing",            // Reference to a space by ID
  "visualization_ids": ["vis-123"]    // References to visualizations by ID
}
```

Note: provide users with a way to choose their own ID when creating resources, otherwise use auto-generated UUIDs.

#### Support referencing resources by identifiers, not just names

Ensure your API accepts references by ID, not just by name or other properties that may change:

```typescript
// Good: Reference by ID
router.post(
  {
    path: '/api/alerting/rule',
    validate: {
      body: schema.object({
        name: schema.string(),
        space_id: schema.string(),       // Space ID reference
        actions: schema.arrayOf(schema.object({
          connector_id: schema.string(), // Connector ID reference
          group: schema.string(),
          // etc.
        }))
      })
    }
  },
  handler
);
```

#### Use consistent reference patterns across APIs

Apply the same patterns for referencing resources across all your APIs:

1. **Consistent naming**: Use the same suffix for IDs (e.g., `space_id`, `dashboard_id`, etc.).
2. **Consistent structure**: Use the same structure for referencing resources in all APIs.
3. **Consistent validation**: Apply the same validation rules across all APIs.

#### Example: Resource with dependencies

```typescript
// Generic object API that references other objects and spaces
router.post(
  {
    path: '/api/objects/object',
    validate: {
      body: schema.object({
        title: schema.string(),
        description: schema.maybe(schema.string()),
        // Reference to space by ID
        space_id: schema.string(),
        // References to other objects by ID
        other_objects: schema.arrayOf(
          schema.object({
            object_id: schema.string(),
          })
        )
      })
    }
  },
  async (context, request, response) => {
    // Implementation with dependency validation
    const validationResult = await validateDependencies(request);
    if (!validationResult.valid) {
      return response.badRequest({
        body: {
          message: 'Validation failed',
          validation: {
            dependencies: validationResult.errors
          }
        }
      });
    }

    // Proceed with creation
    // ...
  }
);
```

### Design human-friendly APIs

APIs with clear, descriptive field names and logical resource structures make both manual testing and Terraform resource development much smoother.

#### Use intuitive field names

Clear, descriptive field names translate to intuitive Terraform resources. Elasticsearch APIs generally follow this pattern, and we end up self-documenting configuration.

[Index resource](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-elasticstack/blob/main/docs/resources/elasticsearch_index.md)
```terraform
resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_index" "example" {
  name                    = "my-index"              # Obvious purpose
  number_of_shards       = 1                       # Self-documenting
  number_of_replicas     = 2                       # Clear meaning
  deletion_protection    = true                    # Prevent accidents
  search_idle_after      = "20s"                   # Human-readable duration
}
```

##### Complex configuration handling

Complex mappings (e.g. saved objects) make life difficult but not impossible. One *can* make complex mappings readable through JSON encoding:

```terraform
mappings = jsonencode({
  properties = {
    user = {
      properties = {
        name = { type = "text" }
        age  = { type = "integer" }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

The hickup here is with validation. Terraform just isn't designed to do validation (or testing!) like we would with conventional languages.
It doesn’t validate what strings contain, only that they're parsable during terraform plan.
Resource developers often fall back to the API layer for validation checks, that can lead to plan/apply issues.

### Return errors early—and all at once

If your API can validate inputs upfront and return all the errors in one go, do it\! Terraform handles it and shows them in a helpful way:

```typescript
// PUT /api/alerting/rule/{id}
...
  response: {
    200: {
      body: () => ruleResponseSchemaV1,
      description: 'Indicates a successful call.',
    },
    400: {
      description: 'Indicates an invalid schema or parameters.',
    },
    403: {
      description: 'Indicates that this call is forbidden.',
    },
    404: {
      description: 'Indicates a rule with the given ID does not exist.',
    },
    409: {
      description: 'Indicates that the rule has already been updated by another user.',
    },
  },
...
```
When validation only happens during execution, catching errors early becomes impossible. For example, ILM policy structure errors only surface during API calls:

```bash
Error: Failed to build [allocate] after last required field arrived
Detail: [allocate] exclude doesn't support values of type: VALUE_STRING
```

[ILM import issues](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-elasticstack/issues/87)

The cost of not catching errors early is interrupted workflow, repetitive plan/apply failures and frustrated consumers.

### No side effects during HTTP GET or read requests

Terraform expects GET requests to be non-destructive and side-effect-free. If your API creates objects, updates data, or does anything else during a GET request, you’re in for trouble.

If you have to have side effects (like updating a ‘last-read’ timestamp), consumers have to work around it by, for example, limiting the number of times something’s read or building custom tooling to handle state drift.

### Standardize patterns across your API

Consistency is key for Terraform resource development. Using standard patterns make reusable abstractions and helper functions possible.

For example, all Elasticsearch resources use the same authentication patterns, whether you're working with indices, security roles, or lifecycle policies:

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {
    username  = "elastic"
    password  = "changeme"
    endpoints = ["http://localhost:9200"]
  }
}
```

[Provider configuration example](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-elasticstack/blob/main/examples/provider/provider.tf)

OpenAPI specifications make generating consistent Kibana and Fleet clients possible:

```bash
# From Makefile - generates standardized clients
internal/clients/fleet/:
	oapi-codegen -package fleet fleet-openapi.json
```

[Provider makefile](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-elasticstack/blob/main/Makefile)

Standardization means authentication, error handling, and request patterns become reusable across all resources.

### Return as much as you can, and handle defaults carefully

Terraform needs complete information to track resource state effectively. If your API doesn't return enough details, Terraform can't properly detect changes or manage drift.

**The challenge with defaults**

Many Kibana APIs have extensive configuration options. Requiring users to specify every single value would create verbose, unwieldy configurations. However, being too sparse with returned data creates problems for Terraform.

**The golden rule**

A resource returned from a GET request should match as closely as possible to what a user specifies in a PUT request. When users don't specify values that affect critical behavior, consider returning those computed values too.

```bash
# User creates resource with minimal config
POST /api/resource { "name": "my-resource" }

# API applies defaults internally
# name: "my-resource"
# timeout: 30s (default)
# retries: 3 (default)

# Later, GET returns only user-specified values
GET /api/resource/my-resource
{ "name": "my-resource" }

# Terraform can't detect if defaults changed!
```

**Why this matters for import operations**

Terraform import brings existing resources under management by reading their current state. If your API returns different data than what users originally configured, it can cause [import state loss bugs](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-elasticstack/issues/53).

### Be predictable

Terraform relies on the same input resulting in the same output.  Avoid using fields like "last modified time"—Terraform can’t compare those meaningfully. This can be tricky with sensitive fields or when your API relies on randomness.

Constantly changing fields in API responses create a difficult situation for Terraform implementations because they cause constant drift.

Timestamps and other time-based fields aren’t predictable:

```
settings {
  setting {
    name = "index.creation_date"      # Timestamp varies
    value = "1643651976221"           # Unix timestamp changes
  }
}
```

The [Alerting Rules API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/operation/operation-post-alerting-rule-id) is another example, where execution status data changes on every read:

```
"execution_status": {
  "status": "active",
  "last_execution_date": "2023-12-07T22:36:41.358Z",  // Changes on every read
  "last_duration": 736
}
```

Users see Terraform detecting "changes" on every refresh, even when nothing in their configuration has actually changed\!

An alternative is to separate volatile runtime data from stable configuration data in responses:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "name": "my-alert",
    "enabled": true,
    "params": {...}
  },
  "runtime_info": {
    "last_execution": "2023-12-07T22:36:41.358Z",
    "execution_count": 42
  }
}
```

Volatile fields create a challenging choice: include them (causing constant configuration drift) or exclude them (losing valuable runtime information).

Including and separating them makes it easier for the TF provider to specifically ignore sets of fields (marking them as [readonly](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/elasticstack/latest/docs/resources/kibana_alerting_rule#read-only)) but needs to be built into the client generator.

### Keep fields isomorphic

**Changing field types break terraform**

Terraform expects fields to maintain the same data type throughout a resource's lifecycle. When a field that was once a string suddenly becomes an array or object, it forces breaking changes that disrupt existing user configurations.

This is exactly what happened when Elasticsearch APIs [changed field types](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-elasticstack/issues/926):

```terraform
# Version 1.0 - field was a string
resource "elasticstack_transform" "example" {
  group_by = "field_name"  # String type
}

# Version 2.0 - same field became an array
resource "elasticstack_transform" "example" {
  group_by = ["field_name"]  # Array type - BREAKING CHANGE!
}
```

Another example is when the Kibana SLO API changed `group_by` from `string` to `string | string[]`.

Changing a field to make it more lenient might look harmless on the surface but means that the API will return values clients don't expect.

**Design for consistency**

If your API needs to support multiple data types for the same logical concept, consider these approaches:

1. **Use separate, clearly named fields**
   ```json
   {
     "group_by_field": "field_name",      // Single field
     "group_by_fields": ["field1", "field2"]  // Multiple fields
   }
   ```

2. **Use the most flexible type from the start**
   ```json
   {
     "group_by": ["field_name"]  // Always an array, even for single values
   }
   ```

**When you have to support flexible types**

If polymorphic behavior is unavoidable, JSON strings provide a workaround—but use them sparingly:

```terraform
resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_index" "example" {
  # Structured fields for simple, predictable values
  number_of_shards   = 1
  number_of_replicas = 2
  # JSON strings only for truly complex, variable structures
  mappings = jsonencode({
    properties = {
      user = { type = "keyword" }
      timestamp = { type = "date" }
    }
  })
}
```

[Index resource schema](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-elasticstack/blob/main/internal/elasticsearch/index/schema.go)

**What's the issue with JSON strings?**

`jsonencode()` and `jsondecode()` come with significant downsides:

- **Limited validation**: Terraform can only validate JSON syntax during plan, not the actual content structure
- **Poor user experience**: Users lose autocompletion, type checking, and clear error messages
- **Complex validation logic**: Content validation is left to the API layer, leading to runtime errors that could have been plan-time validation

**Bottom line**

Consistent field types make everyone's life easier—API consumers, Terraform provider developers, and your future self. When designing your API, choose field types that can accommodate future needs rather than changing them later.

### Make requests transactional

Terraform expects changes to take effect immediately. Design your API so that changes take effect immediately upon successful response.

Consider the scenario:

A user wants to create alerting rules with different configurations, depending on the space they are in.

In Kibana’s UI, they’d create a space, change into that space and then create the rule.

Through curl, the flow would be similar, although they’d probably GET the space to make sure it exists before POSTing the rule.

In terraform, it’s different. Both resources can (and often are) configured at the same time! In the scenario above, the client [needs the space ID](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-elasticstack/blame/0826f4385a29fa58a79f785249f204e13ee3d47c/internal/clients/kibana/alerting.go#L192) to create the rule:

```go
req := client.CreateRuleId(ctxWithAuth, rule.SpaceID, rule.RuleID).KbnXsrf("true").CreateRuleRequest(reqModel)
```

When requests aren’t transactional, we’d need to build the POST & GET workflow into the client, adding complexity to what could have been simple.

Make sure this is the case by, for example,  [setting \`refresh: wait\_for\`](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/188669773e9cc1981b5e89f24afcfdc379ad3058/x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/alerting/server/alerts_client/alerts_client.ts#L644-L657) on the relevant indices in POST requests.

```ts
private async persistAlertsHelper() {
  ...
  await resolveAlertConflicts({
    logger: this.options.logger,
    esClient,
    bulkRequest: {
      refresh: 'wait_for', // Ensure the index is refreshed after the operation
      index: this.indexTemplateAndPattern.alias,
      require_alias: !this.isUsingDataStreams(),
      operations: bulkBody,
    },
    bulkResponse: response,
    ruleId: this.options.rule.id,
    ruleName: this.options.rule.name,
    ruleType: this.ruleType.id,
  });
  ...
}

```

### Offer compare-and-swap

Between refreshing state and applying changes, there’s a gap where someone could modify your API. Generally it's ok to take the approach of last-write-wins.

If you have to consider concurrency control, support mechanisms like ETags and checksums, and the \`version\` property on saved objects.

### Ignore the robustness principle: don’t normalize output

The robustness principle says to accept input in various formats but return output in a consistent format, for example converting strings to lowercase, ordering elements in a list or changing whitespace in \`json\` strings.

For Terraform, don’t do this.

Terraform does byte-for-byte comparisons, so normalized output forces provider developers to implement logic to handle different data formats, ordering, capitalization variations and other unnecessary complexity.

Fortunately, the kibana client hasn’t needed to handle complex normalization yet. Let’s keep it that way, return data exactly as you received it.
Follow these tips, and you'll make your API a dream to work with for Terraform provider developers.

### Example

The spaces API follows these guidelines and makes resource management with Terraform ideal.

Compare the [OAS specs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/v9/operation/operation-get-spaces-space-id) with the [spaces resource configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/elasticstack/latest/docs/resources/kibana_space) and you'll see why:

*Get a space*

```
GET /api/spaces/space/{id}
```

```
curl \
 --request GET 'http://localhost:5622/api/spaces/space/{id}' \
 --header "Authorization: $API_KEY" \
 --header "elastic-api-version: 2023-10-31"
```

Returns 200

```
{
  "id": "test_space",
  "name": "Test Space",
  "color": null,
  "imageUrl": "",
  "initials": "ts",
  "solution": "es",
  "description": "A fresh space for testing visualisati*ons",
  "disabledFeatures": [ingestManager", "enterpriseSearch"]
}
```

*elasticstack_kibana_space*

```
provider "elasticstack" {
  kibana {}
}

resource "elasticstack_kibana_space" "example" {
  space_id          = "test_space"
  name              = "Test Space"
  description       = "A fresh space for testing visualisations"
  disabled_features = ["ingestManager", "enterpriseSearch"]
  initials          = "ts"
}
```

### (Optional) Support bulk operations

Terraform configurations may manage many resources at once. When operating at scale, API efficiency may be a crucial factor. Supporting bulk operations allows Terraform providers to optimize performance and provide a better experience for users managing many resources.

<DocCallOut title="Reach out to Core for guidance" color="warning">
  You may not need to implement bulk operations. Using bulk APIs may require additional work from
  the Terraform provider implementation or you need to carefully design your bulk API to work well as Terraform configuration.
</DocCallOut>

#### Why bulk operations matter for Terraform

When a Terraform configuration manages hundreds of similar resources, individual API calls for each resource can lead to:

- **Performance bottlenecks**: Each HTTP request adds network latency
- **Rate limiting issues**: Many sequential calls may trigger rate limiting

#### Implement efficient bulk endpoints

Add these bulk operation endpoints to complement your individual resource operations:

```

#### Design principles for bulk APIs

1. **Atomic operations**: If one operation fails, provide clear options:
   - Allow partial success with detailed reports
   - Support all-or-nothing transactions when needed

2. **Consistent response format**: Return individual status for each item in the batch:

   ```json
   {
     "items": [
       {
         "id": "resource-1",
         "status": "created",
         "result": { /* complete resource state */ }
       },
       {
         "id": "resource-2",
         "status": "error",
         "error": { "message": "Validation failed", "code": 400 }
       }
     ],
     "took": 42,
     "errors": true
   }
   ```

3. **Reasonable batch sizes**: Document recommended batch sizes and implement server-side limits

4. **Idempotency**: Ensure bulk operations are idempotent for retry safety

5. **Consistent error handling**: Provide detailed errors for each item in the batch

#### Example: Bulk resource creation

```typescript
// Bulk create resources
router.post(
  {
    path: '/api/resources/_bulk_create',
    validate: {
      body: schema.arrayOf(
        schema.object({
          id: schema.string(), // Client-specified ID
          title: schema.string(),
          type: schema.string(),
          space_id: schema.string(),
          // etc.
        })
      )
    }
  },
  async (context, request, response) => {
    const visualizations = request.body;
    const results = [];

    // Process each item in the batch
    for (const viz of visualizations) {
      try {
        const result = await createVisualization(viz);
        results.push({
          id: viz.id,
          status: 'created',
          result
        });
      } catch (error) {
        results.push({
          id: viz.id,
          status: 'error',
          error: {
            message: error.message,
            code: error.statusCode || 500
          }
        });
      }
    }

    const hasErrors = results.some(item => item.status === 'error');

    return response.ok({
      body: {
        items: results,
        took: Date.now() - request.info.received,
        errors: hasErrors
      }
    });
  }
);
```

#### Optimizations for Terraform providers

When implementing bulk operations, consider these Terraform-specific optimizations:

1. **Batch size recommendations**: Document optimal batch sizes to help provider developers maximize performance

2. **Error mapping**: Design error responses that map cleanly to Terraform error handling patterns

3. **State synchronization**: Include complete resource state in responses to avoid additional GET requests
