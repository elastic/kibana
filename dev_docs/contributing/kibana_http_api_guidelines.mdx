## Design principles

### Consistency

Consistency is key to a great API-user experience. APIs should be consistent in their naming, structure, and behavior. Consistency may be domain-specific: it's always best to follow an established pattern. If no pattern exists, consider creating one paying close attention to:

1. **Consistent naming**: Use the same suffix for IDs (e.g., `space_id`, `dashboard_id`, etc.).
2. **Consistent structure**: Use the same structure for referencing resources in requests and responses in all related APIs.
3. **Consistent validation**: Apply the same validation rules across all APIs.
4. **Consistent error messages**: Use the same error messages for the same errors.

This principle is embodied in the rest of this document, so read on for examples!

### Make a great API-user experience

Create a great _API_ user experience, as opposed to optimizing a single API for _UI_ use cases as well. Front-ends have very different needs and constraints from public HTTP API clients. Our public HTTP APIs should be primitives that are simple to use and compose.

For example, a UI might want to optimise it's network requests by bundling multiple requests into a single request, but an API client would be better designed to de-optimise and simplify the requests:

A view or component in the UI might do the following for some, UI-specific purpose:
```
GET /some_related_resources_for_this_page?ids_only=true&page=1
# Which returns:
{
  "a_ids": ["1", "2"],
  "b_ids": ["2"]
}
```

While API clients are better designed as:
```
# Request 1
GET /resource_as?page=1
{
  "items": [{ id: "1", "name": "Resource A 1" }, { id: "2", "name": "Resource A 2" }],
  "page": 1,
  "total": 2
}
# Request 2
GET /resource_bs?page=1
{
  "items": [{ id: "1", "name": "Resource B 1" }],
  "page": 1,
  "total": 1
}
```

<DocCallOut title="Internal vs Public APIs">
  To further reinforce these different purposes Kibana HTTP APIs serve, we categorise them as either **internal** or **public**. See the [Internal vs Public APIs](#internal-vs-public-apis) section for more details.
</DocCallOut>

### Commitment

Public HTTP APIs are long-term commitments that we make to users. We must be committed to maintaining them and ensuring they continue to work as expected (for at least 18 months).

Use the means available: first release new public HTTP APIs as `Technical Preview` or `Beta` to derisk any aspects of the API design you are uncertain about. In this way you can get real-world feedback before declaring an API generally available or stable. If you can find an internal use-case to dog-food an unreleased HTTP API, even better!

Getting your HTTP APIs into a stable state is a process based on feedback from actual users.

<DocCallOut title="Do not break clients!">
  A public HTTP API should never cause a client to break. Not without a long (18 month) deprecation period and a ready alternative.

  Even `Technical Preview` and `Beta` HTTP APIs should consider graceful paths for changes when possible.

  Linus Torvalds famously said of Kernel development: "WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE!" (along with some other expletives). We should adopt this kind of rigor and empathy when working with our _public_ HTTP APIs and always proiritise finding ways to avoid breaking our APIs.

## Internal vs Public APIs

Public HTTP APIs are those that are exposed to users and are used by plugins and external tools. They are the backbone of our public HTTP APIs and are the focus of this document.

Internal HTTP APIs are those that are used by Kibana's own code, like the UI. By default, when you register a new HTTP API it will be classified as `internal`. For example, this API is internal:

```typescript
router.get({ path: '/api/foos' ... }, async () => {...})
```

You can make an HTTP API public by changing the `access` setting to `public`:

```typescript
router.get({ path: '/api/foos', options: { access: 'public' } }, async () => {...})
```

Again, see the principle regarding [commitment](#commitment) before making APIs public!

## Structure

The following are a quick reference for how to structure your HTTP APIs.

### Path

**Use snake case**

`/api/my_api` ✅

`/api/my-api`, `/api/myApi` ❌

**For public APIs, prefix with `/api`**

`/api/my_api` ✅

`/my_api` ❌

**Pluralize collection names**

`PUT /api/resources/{id}` ✅

`PUT /api/resource/{id}` ❌

### Methods

**GET does not accept a body**

`GET /api/resources/{id}` ✅

`GET /api/resources/{id} { body: { params } }` ❌

**POST is for creating a resource**

Sometimes `POST` can be used for an action against a resource or for actions like `GET` but with a body.

**PUT or PATCH are for updating a resource**

`PATCH` is typically used for partial updates and should not result in something being created, while `PUT` might create a resource.

**DELETE is for deleting a resource**

Delete can return a simple response:

```
DELETE /api/resources/{id}
# -> { "ok": true }
```

### Path parameters

**Should use snake case**

`/api/my_api/{my_id}` ✅

`/api/my_api/{myId}` ❌

### Query parameters

**Should use snake case**

`/api/my_api?snake_case=true` ✅

`/api/my_api?snakeCase=false` ❌

### Bodies

**Should contain camelCase keys**

While this diverges from the path, in JavaScript the convention to use `camelCase`
in our request and response bodies provides a better developer experience while
maintaining a solid API user experience.

**Use JSON**

This applies to both requests and responses, unless there is a good justification to return or support different response media types.

**Resource shapes should be consistent**

`GET`, `PUT`, `POST` should return the same shape of data for the same resource.

### Headers

**Should not be used to specify behaviour**

Outside of exceptional cases, you should always use the parameters, query parameters or body of the request to specify behaviour.

### Response codes

**Should always be used as close as possible to their semantic meaning**

See the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status).

### Pagination

**Request**

`GET /api/resources?page=1&size=10`

**Response**

```json
{
  "items": [...],
  "total": 100,
  "page": 1,
  "size": 10
}
```

### Errors

### Special data formats

**Dates**

**Durations**

## Versioning

Kibana's public HTTP APIs are versioned with the entire Elastic organization using data-based versioning. The date indicates the last breaking change. For example: version `2023-10-31` is saying "the last breaking change was at the end of October 2023".

<DocCallOut title="New public date versions will be very sparse" color="warning">
  Do not build your public HTTP APIs with the idea you will be able to change them quickly using versions! Due to the MASSIVE surface area, new date string versions are not introduced lightly and must go through rigorous review and justification.
</DocCallOut>

<DocCallOut title="What about Kibana public APIs that are not explicitly versioned?">
  You may see some routes using `router.get` instead of `router.versioned.get`. Routes registered in the former fashion are assumed to be part of the oldest, `2023-10-31` API surface area and will be included as-is in future version surface areas as well, unless they are explicitly versioned. This is to prevent the need for a wide-spread refactor.
</DocCallOut>

Kibana's internal HTTP APIs can be versioned too, but for a very different purpose! With serverless, we continually roll out code changes _without_ asking browsers to refresh. That means, for a time, browser clients might expect old internal API behavior. It is up to route authors and UI developers to consider how to handle breaking changes of internal routes. Note: you are free to version internal APIs at will to mitigate any unfortunate browser client breakages!
