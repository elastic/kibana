The Embeddables Plugin provides an opportunity to expose reusable interactive widgets that can be embedded outside the original plugin.

If you are planning to integrate with the plugin, please get in touch with the App Services team to get to know all the limitations.

## Capabilities
- Framework-agnostic API.
- Out-of-the-box React support.
- Integration with Redux.
- Integration with the [UI Actions](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/HEAD/src/plugins/ui_actions) plugin.
- Hierarchical structure to enclose multiple widgets.
- Error handling.

## Key Concepts
### Embeddable
Embeddable is a re-usable widget that can be rendered on a dashboard as well as in other applications.
Developers are free to embed them directly in their plugins.
End users can dynamically select an embeddable to add to a _container_.
Dashboard container powers the grid of panels on the Dashboard app.

### Container
Container is a special type of embeddable that can hold other embeddable items.
Embeddables can be added dynamically to the containers, but that should be implemented on the end plugin side.
Currently, the dashboard plugin provides such functionality.

### Input
Every embeddable has an input which is a serializable set of data.
This data can be used to update the state of the embeddable widget.
The input can be updated later so that the embeddable should be capable of reacting to those changes.

### Output
Every embeddable may expose some data to the external interface.
Usually, it is diverged from the input and not necessarily serializable.
Output data can also be updated, but that should always be done inside the embeddable.
