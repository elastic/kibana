Kibana index patterns (KIPs) are the central method of describing sets of indices for queries. Usage is strongly recommended
as a number of high level building blocks use them, (TODO LINK) in addition to allowing users to look at the same data 
sets in a variety of KIP supporting Kibana apps.

KIPs are defined by a
wildcard string (an index pattern) which matches indices, datastreams, and index aliases, optionally specify a
timestamp field for time series data, and are stored as a <DocLink id="kibDevDocsSavedObjectsIntro" text="saved
object"/>. They have a field list which comprises all the fields in matching indices plus fields defined specifically
on the KIP via runtime fields. Schema-on-read functionality is provided by KIP defined runtime fields.



KIP functionlity is available via the data plugin (`data.indexPatterns`) and most commonly used with SearchSource
(`data.search.search`) to perform queries. SearchSource will apply existing filters and queries from the search bar UI.

Users can create KIPs via [Index pattern management](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index-patterns.html)
although they can also be created through the index patterns API.

KIPs also allow formatters and custom labels to be defined for fields.
