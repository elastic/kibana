## CI

Kibana uses BuildKite to run a series of checks against each pull requests and tracked branch.  Results are posted in pull requests as comments and from the BuildKite UI

### Comments

Comments in pull requests can be used to trigger CI operations.

#### `buildkite test this`

Run test suites and checks.

#### `@elasticmachine merge upstream`

Merge in the most recent changes from upstream.

#### `@elasticmachine run elasticsearch-ci/docs`

Build documentation from the root `docs` folder.

### Labels

Labels can be added to a pull request to run conditional pipelines.

#### `ci:deploy-cloud`

Deploy a pull request to Elastic Cloud.  Deployment information will be available as an annotation at the top of a build.  Access credentials will be available in vault.

#### `ci:build-all-platforms`

Build Windows, macOS, and Linux archives.  Artifacts will be available on the "Artifacts" tab of the "Build Kibana Distribution and Plugins" step.

#### `ci:build-os-packages`

Build Docker images, and Debian and RPM packages.  Artifacts will be available on the "Artifacts" tab of the "Build Kibana Distribution and Plugins" step.

#### `ci:all-cypress-suites`

By default, Cypress test suites are only run when code changes are made in certain files, typically files with overlapping test coverage.  Adding this label will cause all Cypress tests to run.
