## CI

Kibana uses BuildKite to run a series of checks against each pull requests and tracked branch.  Results are posted in pull requests as comments and from the BuildKite UI

### Comments

Comments in pull requests can be used to trigger CI operations.

#### `buildkite test this`

Run test suites and checks.

#### `@elasticmachine merge upstream`

Merge in the most recent changes from upstream.

#### `@elasticmachine run elasticsearch-ci/docs`

Build documentation from the root `docs` folder.

### Labels

Labels can be added to a pull request to run conditional pipelines.  Build artifacts will be available on the "Artifacts" tab of the "Build Kibana Distribution and Plugins" step.

#### `ci:all-cypress-suites`

Some Cypress test suites are only run when code changes are made in certain files, typically files with overlapping test coverage.  Adding this label will cause all Cypress tests to run.
