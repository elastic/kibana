# Overview

Development on Windows is recommended through WSL2.  WSL lets users run a Linux environment on Windows, providing a supported development environment for Kibana.

<DocCallOut title="Prerequisites">
  For a basic WSL usage you must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11.
  
  However, in order to fully complete the guide and have a full development experience like running GUI apps as suggested bellow you must be running **Windows 11 (Build 22000 and higher)**.
  In addition to that installing a **vGPU driver** is also required. Please choose the one compatible with your hardware: 

  - [Intel GPU driver for WSL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19344/intel-graphics-windows-dch-drivers.html?)
  - [AMD GPU driver for WSL](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-wsl-support)
  - [NVIDIA GPU driver for WSL](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl)
  
  More information for that could be found in the [official guide for GUI apps on WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps#install-support-for-linux-gui-apps).

## Install WSL

The latest setup instructions can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

1) Open Powershell as an administrator

2) Install WSL with Ubuntu and restart the machine when prompted
    ```
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu
    ```

    In case you already have WSL installed you can just `wsl --update` and then reboot the machine.

3) Once rebooted the installation will proceed for a new WSL install. If that's not the case make sure you're using 
   WSL2 and Ubuntu by
   ```
   wsl --set-default-version 2
   ```

   and

   ```
   wsl --set-default Ubuntu 
   ```  

4) Install support for Google Chrome by running the following inside WSL shell (**Windows 11 Build 22000 and higher only**)

   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade && sudo apt -y autoremove 
   cd /tmp
   sudo wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
   sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
   sudo apt install --fix-broken -y
   sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
   ```

  Now you can launch Google Chrome by either `google-chrome` on your WSL shell or from Ubuntu Applications on Windows. 
  
  It's also worth it to check if there are other useful [GUI packages you would want to add on WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps#update-the-packages-in-your-distribution) and then the configuration is complete.

## Setup Kibana

The next step is now <DocLink id="kibDevTutorialSetupDevEnv" section="get-the-code" text="setup your development environment" /> for Kibana inside WSL just like in any other case.

## Install VSCode

Even though in previous steps you might have installed Nautilus and other X11 apps that allows you to use the file explorer for the WSL environment or even using some apps supported by X11 like 
Sublime Text our recommended way to write your code is by using VSCode installed natively on Windows and then use its remote development extension to connect into the WSL environment. You can do this 
by completing the following:

1) Install VSCode on Windows
2) Check the "Add to PATH" option during setup
3) Install the [Remote Development](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension) package

For more information you can find the official documentation on how to Remote development is supported with an extension [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).

## Success

At this point you should be able to develop Kibana using WSL by writing code on VSCode, running commands for build, test and manage your dev environment using the WSL shell and finally having a basic GUI 
support for your WSL environment using the applications we recommended like Google Chrome and others you choose to install like for example Nautilus file manager or other X11 based ones.
