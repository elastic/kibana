There are multiple ways to go about debugging Kibana when running from source.

## Debugging using Chrome DevTools

You will need to run Node using `--inspect` or `--inspect-brk` in order to enable the inspector. Additional information can be found in the [Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).

Once Node is running with the inspector enabled, you can open `chrome://inspect` in your Chrome browser. You should see a remote target for the inspector running. Click "inspect". You can now begin using the debugger.

Next we will go over how to exactly enable the inspector for different aspects of the codebase.

### Jest Unit Tests

You will need to run Jest directly from the Node script:

`node --inspect-brk scripts/jest [TestPathPattern]`

### Functional Test Runner

`node --inspect-brk scripts/functional_test_runner`

### Development Server 

`node --inspect-brk scripts/kibana`

## Debugging using logging

When running Kibana, it's sometimes helpful to enable verbose logging.

`yarn start --verbose`

Using verbose logging usually results in much more information than you're interested in. The [logging documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/logging-settings.html) covers ways to change the log level of certain types.

In the following example of a configuration stored in `config/kibana.dev.yml` we are logging all Elasticsearch queries and any logs created by the Management plugin.

```
logging:
  appenders:
    console:
      type: console
      layout:
        type: pattern
        highlight: true
  root:
    appenders: [default, console]
    level: info

  loggers:
    - name: plugins.management
      level: debug
    - name: elasticsearch.query
      level: debug
```
