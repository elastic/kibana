To support versioned APIs we need to keep past versions of interfaces around. This tutorial presents one strategy to manage your interfaces.

## The strategy

Every plugin has a _domain_. A domain consists of a one or more concepts, usually objects, that are related in some logical way.

At a high level the strategy for versioning our interfaces is:

> Version a collection of related interfaces together. Whenever a single interface changes, increment the version of the entire collection of interfaces.

Characteristics of this strategy:

1. Avoid the `extends` keyword for referencing past interfaces. This results in cleaner API docs being generated.
2. Leverage `* as` to create versioned namespaces rather than versioned interfaces.
3. Although it is verbose, for a single change in a collection, we create a new version of the related collection.

### An example: Weather insights unversioned
Consider a fictional Kibana plugin called "Weather insights". It allows users to easily create and curate dashboards that house visualisations and metrics for weather data. The domain contains the following:

1. **Data source**: an endpoint that is scraped and ingested into ES for aggregation and search.
2. **Weather dashboard**: a set of visualisations and metrics that draws from a data source.

We have the following `common` interfaces:

```ts
interface DataSource {
  /** Some URL that provides weather data in an expected format for scraping */
  url: string;
  /** The data view data is stored in */
  dataViewId: string;
  /** Username to use with source URL */
  username?: string;
  /** Password to use with source URL */
  password?: string;
}

/** Fictional type, only used for this example as an external type */
import type { PortableDashboard } from '@kbn/dashboard/common';

interface WeatherDashboard {
  /** A unqiue ID for this weather dashboard */
  id: string;
  /** Definition of a dashboard imported from the `dashboard` plugin */
  dashboard: PortableDashboard;
  /** Data source to use with this dashboard */
  source: DataSource;
}

type UnsavedWeatherDashboard = Omit<WeatherDashboard, 'id'>;

/** Below are the HTTP APIs based on the domain types */

interface GetWeatherDashboardHTTPResponse {
  weatherDashboard: WeatherDashboard;
}

interface CreateWeatherDashboardHTTPBody {
  weatherDashboard: UnsavedWeatherDashboard;
}

interface CreateWeatherDashboardHTTPResponse {
  weatherDashboard: WeatherDashboard;
}

// Imagine this pattern for the update and list endpoints too.
```

### An example: Weather insights versioned

The following product requirements are added to the Weather insights plugin:

1. Data sources need a more user-friendly name, currently we just show a URL
2. New feature: **Predictions** that will generate forecasts based on past and current weather data

Before we make these changes, we need to make sure that our current interfaces are not lost.

#### Preparing our interfaces for versions

We are going to make our current set of interfaces `v1`. Let's reflect this in our code by creating this file structure in `common`:

```
common
  index.ts
  latest.ts
  data_source
    v1.ts
  weather_dashboard
    v1.ts
public
  ...
server
  ...
```

By placing `DataSource` and `WeatherDashboard` in two folders we indicate that they _could_ version independently. Specifically,
`WeatherDashboard` may version independently of `DataSource`.

**Note:** At this stage, splitting these concepts may be overkill if we expect `WeatherDashboard` to _rarely_ change, but for this example we would like the ability to version them separately.

The `latest.ts` file is going to act as an alias to the latest set of interfaces. It will look like this:

```ts
// "export *" is considered safe here because we ONLY have types in these files.
export * from './data_source/v1';
export * from './weather_data/v1';
```

Our `index.ts` file will contain:

```ts
// Explicit export of everything from latest
export { DataSource, WeatherDashboard, GetWeatherDashboardHTTPResponse } from './latest';

export * as weatherDashboardV1 from './weather_dashboard/v1';
export * as dataSourceV1 from './data_source/v1';
```

How we use these types depends on whether the code is aware of versions or not. Generally, code that is aware of multiple versions will create greater complexity.

```ts
// This type is being pulled from "latest", so whenever a new latest is linked,
// it will also point to the latest WeatherDashboard.
import type { WeatherDashboard } from '../common';

function logIt(dashboard: WeatherDashboard) {
  logger.debug(dashboard);
}
```

<DocCallOut title="Minimize the impact of refactors">
  By referencing types linked from `latest.ts` we will not have to refactor all our app code to point to the latest version of `WeatherDashboard`. This happens by simply re-exporting the newest types from `latest.ts`.
</DocCallOut>

```ts
// Consider this route handler that expects V1 weather dashboard requests
import type { weatherDashboardV1 } from '../common';

const handler = (ctx, req, res) => {
  const body: weatherDashboardV1.GetWeatherDashboardHTTPResponse = { ... };
  return res.ok({ body });
}
```

### Introducing a new field to `DataSource`

Now that we have prepared our interfaces to be versioned, let's introduce the `name` field to `DataSource`.

Create a new `v2.ts` file under the `data_source` directory:

```
common
  data_source
    v1.ts
    v2.ts
```

The `v2.ts` file will contain:

```ts
interface DataSource {
  /** Some URL that provides weather data in an expected format for scraping */
  url: string;
  /** A user-friendly name */
  name?: string;
  /** The data view data is stored in */
  dataViewId: string;
  /** Username to use with source URL */
  username?: string;
  /** Password to use with source URL */
  password?: string;
}
```

We also need to update the `WeatherDashboard` interface to use our new `DataSource` interface:

```
common
  weather_dashboard
    v1.ts
    v2.ts
```

```ts
// common/weather_dashboard/v2.ts

// This is largely a copy of v1.ts, but using a new WeatherDashboard type in all
// the relevant places

/** Fictional type, only used for this example as an external type */
import type { PortableDashboard } from '@kbn/dashboard/common';
import type { DataSource } from '../data_source/v2';

// Optionally, re-export the entire set of types.
export * from './v1';

interface WeatherDashboard {
  /** A unqiue ID for this weather dashboard */
  id: string;
  /** Definition of a dashboard imported from the `dashboard` plugin */
  dashboard: PortableDashboard;
  /** Data source to use with this dashboard */
  source: DataSource;
}

type UnsavedWeatherDashboard = Omit<WeatherDashboard, 'id'>;

/** Below are the HTTP APIs based on the domain types */

interface GetWeatherDashboardHTTPResponse {
  weatherDashboard: WeatherDashboard;
}

interface CreateWeatherDashboardHTTPBody {
  weatherDashboard: UnsavedWeatherDashboard;
}

interface CreateWeatherDashboardHTTPResponse {
  weatherDashboard: WeatherDashboard;
}

// Imagine this pattern for the update and list endpoints too.

```

<DocCallOut title="Inherit types from the `v1` namespace">
 It is possible to add `export * from './v1';` to the top of our `weather_dashboard/v2.ts` file to re-export unchanged types and avoid copying the whole file.

 However, copying and adapting the entire set of types is OK too. If we have correctly grouped our sub-domains we should be versioning all collections of types together.
</DocCallOut>

Now we update the `latest.ts` and `index.ts` files accordingly:

```ts
// latest.ts
export * from './data_source/v2';
export * from './weather_dashboard/v2';
```

```ts
// index.ts
// Explicit export of everything from latest
export { DataSource, WeatherDashboard, GetWeatherDashboardHTTPResponse } from './latest';

export * as weatherDashboardV1 from './weather_dashboard/v1';
export * as dataSourceV1 from './data_source/v1';

export * as weatherDashboardV2 from './weather_dashboard/v2';
export * as dataSourceV2 from './data_source/v2';
```

### Introduce a new sub-domain: `Prediction`

For our second product requirement we are going to introduce a new concept. Let's start by updating our folder structure:

```
common
  index.ts
  latest.ts
  data_source
  weather_dashboard
  prediction
    v1.ts
```

```ts
// common/prediction/v1.ts

import type { DataSource } from '../data_source/v2';

/** Random set of weather models, just for illustration */
type Model = 'GFS' | 'ECMWF' | 'GEM';

/** Limited set of options rather than "string" so we can more easily version */
type TimeFrame = '1d' | '2d' | '3d' | '4d' | '5d' | '6d' | '1w' | '2w';

interface PredictionInput {
  /** How far back we should look in our data */
  start_date: string;
  /** How far out to predict. Note, longer time frames result in lower accuracy */
  time_frame: TimeFrame;
  /** Choice of weather model to use */
  model: Model;
  /** Data source for this prediction */
  dataSource: DataSource;
}

interface PredictionOutput { ... }

// Below are HTTP APIs for predictions

interface CreatePredictionHTTPBody {
  input: PredictionInput;
}

interface CreatePredictionHTTPResponse {
  result: PredictionOutput;
}

// And so forth...
```

Both `WeatherDashboard` and `Prediction` reference `DataSource`. Therefore, both will increment their version whenever `DataSource` changes.

## Challenge

Normalize our domain objects by only holding a reference to `DataSource` in `WeatherDashboard` and `Prediction` domain objects.
