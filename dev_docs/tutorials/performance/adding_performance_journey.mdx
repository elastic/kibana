## Overview
In order to achieve our goal of creating best user experience in Kibana, it is important to keep track on its different features performance.
To make things easier, we introduced performance journeys, that mimics end-user experience with Kibana.

Journey runs a flow of user interactions with Kibana in a browser and collects APM metrics for both server and client-side.
It is possible to instrument Kibana with [custom performance metrics](https://docs.elastic.dev/kibana-dev-docs/tutorials/performance/adding_custom_performance_metrics),
that will provide more detailed information about feature performance.

Journeys core is [kbn-journeys](packages/kbn-journeys/README.mdx) package. It is a function test by design and is powered
by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) end-to-end testing tool.

### Adding a new performance journey
Let's assume we instrumented dashboard with load time metrics and want to track sample data flights dashboard performance.
Journey supports loading test data with esArchiver or kbnArchiver. Similar to functional tests, it might require to implement custom wait
for UI rendering to be completed.

Simply create a new file in `x-pack/performance/journeys` with the following code:

```
export const journey = new Journey({
  esArchives: ['x-pack/performance/es_archives/sample_data_flights'],
  kbnArchives: ['x-pack/performance/kbn_archives/flights_no_map_dashboard'],
})

  .step('Go to Dashboards Page', async ({ page, kbnUrl }) => {
    await page.goto(kbnUrl.get(`/app/dashboards`));
    await page.waitForSelector('#dashboardListingHeading');
  })

  .step('Go to Flights Dashboard', async ({ page, log }) => {
    await page.click(subj('dashboardListingTitleLink-[Flights]-Global-Flight-Dashboard'));
    await waitForVisualizations(page, log, 14);
  });
```

In oder to get correct and consistent metrics, it is important to design journey properly:
- use archives to generate test data
- decouple complex scenarios into multiple simple journeys
- use waiting for page loading / UI component rendering
- test locally and check if journey is stable.
- make sure performance metrics are collected on every run.

### Running performance journey locally for troubleshooting purposes
You need to run the Node script:
  `node scripts/run_performance.js --journey-path x-pack/performance/journeys/$YOUR_JOURNEY_NAME.ts`

Scripts steps include:
- start Elasticsearch
- start Kibana and run journey first time (warmup) only APM metrics being reported
- start Kibana and run journey second time (test): both EBT and APM metrics being reported
- stop Elasticsearch

You can skip warmup phase for debug purpose by using `--skip-warmup` flag

Since the tests are run on a local machine, there is also realistic throttling applied to the network to 
simulate real life internet connection. This means that all requests have a [fixed latency and limited bandwidth](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/test/performance/services/performance.ts#L157).

### Benchmarking performance on CI
In order to keep track on performance metrics stability journeys are run on main branch with scheduled interval.
Bare metal machine is used to produce results as stable and reproducible as possible.

#### Machine specifications

All benchmarks are run on bare-metal machines with the [following specifications](https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ex100):

CPU: Intel® Core™ i9-12900K
RAM: 128 GB
SSD: 1.92 TB Data center Gen4 NVMe 

#### Track performance results
APM metrics are reported to [kibana-ops-e2e-perf](https://kibana-ops-e2e-perf.kb.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io/) cluster.
You can filter transactions using labels, e.g. `labels.journeyName : "flight_dashboard"`

Custom metrics reported with EBT are available in Telemetry Staging cluster, `kibana-performance` space.
