# Build and track custom performance metrics
Having access to performance metrics allows us to better understand user experience across Kibana, identify issues and fix it.
Custom metrics allows to monitor critical flows like server start, saved objects fetching or dashboard loading times.

## Instrument your code to report metric event.
We use event-based telemetry (EBT) to report client-side metrics as events.
If you want to add a custom metric on server side, please notify the #kibana-core team in advance.

Let's assume we intend to report the performance of a specific action called `APP_ACTION`.
In order to do so, we need to first measure the timing of that action. The [`performance.now()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now) API can help with that:

```typescript
const actionStartTime = performance.now();
// action is started and finished
const actionDuration = window.performance.now() - actionStartTime; // Duration in milliseconds
```

Once we have the time measurement, we can use the `reportPerformanceMetricEvent` API to report it.

```typescript
reportPerformanceMetricEvent(analytics, {
  eventName: APP_ACTION,     
  duration: actionDuration,
});
```

After the journey run is finished, the metric will be delivered to the [Telemetry Staging](https://telemetry-v2-staging.elastic.dev/) cluster, alongside with the event's context.
The data is updated periodically, so you might have to wait up to 30 minutes to see your data in the index.

Once indexed, this metric will appear in `ebt-kibana` index. It is also mapped into an additional index, dedicated to performance metrics.
We recommend using the `Kibana Performance` space on the telemetry cluster, where you get an `index patten` to easily access this data.
Each document in the index has the following structure:

```typescript
{
  "_index": "backing-ebt-kibana-browser-performance-metrics-000001",    // Performance metrics are stored at a dedicated simplified index (browser \ server). 
  "_source": {
    "timestamp": "2022-08-31T11:29:58.275Z"
    "event_type": "performance_metric",                                 // All events share a common event type to simplify mapping
    "eventName": APP_ACTION,                                            // Event name as specified when reporting it
    "duration": 736,                                                    // Event duration as specified when reporting it
    "context": {                                                        // Context holds information identifying the deployment, version, application and page that generated the event
      "version": "8.5.0-SNAPSHOT",
      "applicationId": "dashboards",
      "page": "app",
      "entityId": "61c58ad0-3dd3-11e8-b2b9-5d5dc1715159",
      "branch": "main",
      "labels": {
        "journeyName": "flight_dashboard",
        ...
      }
      ...
    },
    ...
  },
}
```

### Performance events with breakdowns and metadata

Lets assume we are interested in benchmarking the performance of a more complex event `COMPLEX_APP_ACTION`, that is made up of two steps: 
 - `INSPECT_DATA` measures the time it takes to retrieve a user's profile and check if there is a cached version of their data.
    - If the cached data is fresh it proceeds with a flow `use-local-data`
    - If data needs to be refreshed, it proceeds with a flow `load-data-from-api`.
 - `PROCESS_DATA` loads and processes the data depending on the flow chosen in the previous step.

We could utilize the additional options supported by the `reportPerformanceMetricEvent` API:

```typescript
import { reportPerformanceMetricEvent } from '@kbn/ebt-tools';

reportPerformanceMetricEvent(analytics, {
  eventName: COMPLEX_APP_ACTION,     
  duration,                                   // Total duration in milliseconds
  key1    : INSPECT_DATA,                     // Claiming free key1 to be used for INSPECT_DATA
  value1  : durationOfStepA,                  // Total duration of step INSPECT_DATA in milliseconds
  key2    : PROCESS_DATA,                     // Claiming free key2 to be used for PROCESS_DATA
  value2  : durationOfStepB,                  // Total duration of step PROCESS_DATA in milliseconds
  meta: {
    dataSource: 'flow2',                     // Providing event specific context. This can be useful to create meaningful aggregations.
  },
});
```

This event will be indexed with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  "_index": "backing-ebt-kibana-browser-performance-metrics-000001",    // Performance metrics are stored in a dedicated simplified index (browser \ server). 
  "_source": {
    "timestamp": "2022-08-31T11:29:58.275Z"
    "event_type": "performance_metric",                                 // All events share a common event type to simplify mapping
    "eventName": COMPLEX_APP_ACTION,                                    // Event name as specified when reporting it
    "duration": 736,                                                    // Event duration as specified when reporting it
    "key1": INSPECT_DATA,                                               // The key name of INSPECT_DATA
    "value1": 250,                                                      // The duration of step INSPECT_DATA
    "key2": PROCESS_DATA,                                               // The key name of PROCESS_DATA
    "value2": 520,                                                      // The duration of step PROCESS_DATA
    "meta": {
      "dataSource": 'load-data-from-api', 
    },    
    "context": {                                                        // Context holds information identifying the deployment, version, application and page that generated the event
      "version": "8.5.0-SNAPSHOT",
      "cluster_name": "job-ftr_configs_2-cluster-ftr",
      "pageName": "application:dashboards:app",
      "applicationId": "dashboards",
      "page": "app",
      "entityId": "61c58ad0-3dd3-11e8-b2b9-5d5dc1715159",
      "branch": "main",
      "labels": {
        "journeyName": "flight_dashboard",
      }
      ...
    },
    ...
  },
}
```

The performance metrics API supports **5 numbered free fields** that can be used to report numeric metrics that you intend to analyze.
Note that they can be used for any type of numeric information you may want to report and use to create your own flexible schema, 
without having to add custom mappings.

If you want to provide event specific context, you can add properties to the `meta` field.
The `meta` object is stored as a [flattened field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/flattened.html) hence 
it's searchable and can be used to further breakdown event metrics.

**Note**: It's important to keep in mind `free field` values are integers and floating point values will be rounded.

### How to choose and measure events

Events should be meaningful and can have multiple sub metrics which will give specific information of certain actions. For example 
page-load events can be composed of render time, data load time during the page-load and so on. It's important to understand these 
events will have meaning for performance investigations and that can be used in visualizations, aggregations. Considering this, 
creating an event for cpuUsage does not bring any value because it doesn't bring any context with itself and reporting multiple of these 
events in different places of code will have so much variability during performance analysis of your code. However it can be nice attribute
to follow if it's important for you to look inside of a specific event e.g. `page-load`. 

- **Make sure that the event is clearly defined and consistent** (i.e. same code flow is executed each time).
  Consider the start point and endpoint of the measurement and what happens between those points.
  For example: a `app-data-load` event should not include the time it takes to render the data.
- **Choose event names wisely**.
  Try to balance event names specificity. Calling an event `load` is too generic, calling an event `tsvb-data-load` is too specific (instead the visualization 
  type can be specified in a `meta` field)
- **Distinguish between flows with event context**. 
  If a function that loads data is called when an app loads, when the user changes filters and when the refresh button is clicked, you should distinguish between
  these flows by specifying a `meta` field.
- **Avoid duplicate events**.
  Make sure that measurement and reporting happens in a point of the code that is executed only once. 
  For example, make sure that refresh events are reported only once per button click.
- **Measure as close to the event as possible**.
  For example, if you're measuring the execution of a specific React Effect execution, place the measurement code inside the effect.
  try to place the measurement start right before  the navigation is performed and stop measuring as soon as all resources are loaded
- **Use the `window.performance` API**.
  The [`performance.now()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now) API can be used to accurate way to receive timestamps 
  The [`performance.mark()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/mark) API can be used to track performance without having to pollute the 
  code.
- **Keep performance in mind**. Reporting the performance of Kibana should never harm its own performance. 
  Avoid sending events too frequently (`onMouseMove`) or adding serialized JSON objects (whole `SavedObjects`) into the meta object.

### Analyzing journey results
The telemetry data will be reported to the Telemetry Staging cluster alongside with execution context.
Use the `context.labels.ciBuildName` label to filter down events to only those originating from performance runs and visualize the duration of events (or their breakdowns):
 - Be sure to narrow your analysis down to performance events by specifying a filter `context.labels.ciBuildName: kibana-single-user-performance`.
   Otherwise you might be looking at results originating from different hardware.
 - You can look at the results of a specific journey by filtering on `context.labels.journeyName`.

Please contact the #kibana-performance team if you need more help visualizing and tracking the results.

### Production performance tracking

All users who are opted in to report telemetry will start reporting event based telemetry as well.
The data is available to be analyzed on the production telemetry cluster.
