- Have nestedPath properly supported on each field in indexPattern

See elasticsearch.angular.js:
  Need to change the call from getFieldMapping in mapper.js to getMapping, this will require processing the response in a different way in _transform_mapping_into_fields.js:17.
  
  Additionally will need to add a new prop to the field object (nestedPath).
  
  
- Merge nested aggregation code with above, and have nested/reverse nested work OOTB based on the field
  settings
  
  
- Research basic parser tools/libs 

- Implement basic query parsing 

- Port query adapter (ignore filters for the moment)
  - hook somewhere in from_user.js/to_user.js/parse_query.js
