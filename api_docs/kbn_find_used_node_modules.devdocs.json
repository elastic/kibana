          "\nParse a list of entry paths and find the node_modules which are required by them. If the\nentry path requires/imports a non-node_module then that file is scanned too, deeply, until\nall referenced files are scanned.\n\nOptionally, we can find the used peers of the used node_modules. This will keep track of all\nthe paths we use to enter a node_module and then traverse from those points, finding the\nused modules and comparing those to the `peerDependencies` listed in the node_module's package.json\nfile. If a used dependeny is in the `peerDependencies` and is used by the node_module it will\nbe included in the results.\n\nThis was implemented mostly for `@emotion/react` which is used by @elastic/eui but only listed\nas a peerDependency. If we didn't keep it in the Kibana package.json then the package would not\nbe installed and cause an error on startup because `@emotion/react` can't be found. We used to\nsolve this by scanning the node_modules directory for all the packages which are used but that\nwas much slower and lead to extra entries in package.json."
