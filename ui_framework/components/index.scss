// Kibana UI framework
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This libray will eventually contain all styles used throughout Kibana. Currently it
// only covers a portion of the components. The processed css from this library currently
// loads on top of other CSS (itself generated from LESS files) contained in /ui/*/*.less
// files. This includes some base LESS files (including bootstrap) that can be found in
// /ui/styles/. Over time, those components will be replaced with the SASS files
// contained here. Until then, know that styling here may run into conflict with
// global styles (like those on naked selectors) contained there.
//
// When possible, if making changes to those legacy components, please think about
// instead adding them to this library and deprecating that dependency.
