    <h1>This is Heading One</h1>
    <p>
      Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of
      the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded
      yellow sun.
    </p>

    <p>
      Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles
      is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-
      descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still
      think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>List item one</li>
      <li>List item two</li>
      <li>Dolphins</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most
      of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.
      Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these
      were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces
      of paper, which is odd because on the whole it was not the small
      green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
    </p>

    <h2>This is Heading Two</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Number one</li>
      <li>Number two</li>
      <li>Dolphins again</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      But the dog wasn&rsquo;t lazy, it was just
      practicing mindfulness, so it had a greater sense of
      life-satisfaction than that fox with all its silly jumping.
    </p>

    <p>
      And from the fox&rsquo;s perspective, life was full of hoops to jump <em>through</em>, low-hanging
      fruit to jump <em>for</em>, and dead car batteries to jump-<em>start</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>This is Heading Three</h3>

    <p>
      So it thought the dog was making a poor life choice by focusing so much on mindfulness.
      What if its car broke down?
