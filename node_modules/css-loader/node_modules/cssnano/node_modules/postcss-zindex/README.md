# [postcss][postcss]-zindex [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ben-eb/postcss-zindex.svg?branch=master)][ci] [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/postcss-zindex.svg)][npm] [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/ben-eb/postcss-zindex.svg)][deps]

> Reduce z-index values with PostCSS.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-zindex) do:

```
npm install postcss-zindex --save
```

## Example

Sometimes, you may introduce z-index values into your CSS that are larger than
necessary, in order to improve your understanding of how each stack relates to
the others. For example, you might have a modal overlay at `5000` and the dialog
for it at `5500` - so that modal classes occupy the `5xxx` space.

But in production, it is unnecessary to use such large values for z-index where
smaller values would suffice. This module will reduce all z-index declarations
whilst respecting your original intent; such that the overlay becomes `1` and
the dialog becomes `2`. For more examples, see the [tests](test.js).

### Input

```css
.modal {
    z-index: 5000
}

.modal-overlay {
    z-index: 5500
}
```

### Output

```css
.modal {
    z-index: 1
}

.modal-overlay {
    z-index: 2
}
```

Note that this module does not attempt to normalize relative z-index values,
such as `-1`. Be careful with using this module alongside JavaScript injected
CSS; ideally you should have already extracted all of your stacking context
into CSS.

## Usage

See the [PostCSS documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage) for
examples for your environment.
