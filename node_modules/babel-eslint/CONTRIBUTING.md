# Contributing

Thanks for contributing!

If you're about to report an issue - please first check if it's already been reported in the [issues page](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint/issues).

Also check to see if the latest versions of eslint/babel-eslint still produce the issue.

Also check out the [Known Issues](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint#known-issues) section of the README.

If you are having issues with JSX you might want to check out eslint-plugin-react. If there's an issue with new experimental syntax you might need to report that in eslint-plugin-babel instead.
