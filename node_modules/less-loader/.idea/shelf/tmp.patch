-webpack provides an [advanced mechanism to resolve files](http://webpack.github.io/docs/resolving.html). The less-loader stubs less' `fileLoader` and passes all queries to the webpack resolving engine. Thus you can import your less-modules from `node_modules` or `bower_components`. Just prepend them with a `~` which tells webpack to look-up the [`modulesDirectories`](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-modulesdirectories)

-It's important to only prepend it with `~`, because `~/` resolves to the home-directory. webpack needs to distinguish `bootstrap` from `~bootstrap` because css- and less-files have no special syntax for importing relative files:
-
-```css
-@import "file";
-```
-
-is the same as
-
-```css
-@import "./file";
-```
