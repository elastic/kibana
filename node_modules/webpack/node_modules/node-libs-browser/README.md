[![dependencies status](http://david-dm.org/webpack/node-libs-browser.png)](http://david-dm.org/webpack/node-libs-browser)

Exports a hash [object] of absolute paths to each lib, keyed by lib names. Modules without browser replacements are `null`.

Some modules have mocks in the `mock` directory. These are replacements with minimal functionality.
