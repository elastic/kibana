.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Opens the package folder in the default editor (or whatever you've
configured as the npm \fBeditor\fR config \-\- see \fBnpm help config\fR\|\.)
.P
After it has been edited, the package is rebuilt so as to pick up any
changes in compiled packages\.
.P
For instance, you can do \fBnpm install connect\fR to install connect
into your package, and then \fBnpm\.commands\.edit(["connect"], callback)\fR
to make a few changes to your locally installed copy\.
.P
The first parameter is a string array with a single element, the package
to open\. The package can optionally have a version number attached\.
.P
Since this command opens an editor in a new process, be careful about where
and how this is used\.
