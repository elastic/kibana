public using \fBnpm publish \-\-access=public\fR, or set their access as public using
\fBnpm access public\fR after the initial publish\.

If your account is not paid, then attempts to publish scoped packages will fail
with an HTTP 402 status code (logically enough), unless you use
\fB\-\-access=public\fR\|\.
