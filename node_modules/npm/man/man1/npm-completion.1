.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Enables tab\-completion in all npm commands\.
.P
The synopsis above
loads the completions into your current shell\.  Adding it to
your ~/\.bashrc or ~/\.zshrc will make the completions available
everywhere\.
.P
You may of course also pipe the output of npm completion to a file
such as \fB/usr/local/etc/bash_completion\.d/npm\fR if you have a system
that will read that file for you\.
.P
When \fBCOMP_CWORD\fR, \fBCOMP_LINE\fR, and \fBCOMP_POINT\fR are defined in the
environment, \fBnpm completion\fR acts in "plumbing mode", and outputs
completions based on the arguments\.
