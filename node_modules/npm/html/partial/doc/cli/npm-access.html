</code></pre><h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Used to set access controls on private packages.</p>
<p>For all of the subcommands, <code>npm access</code> will perform actions on the packages
in the current working directory if no package name is passed to the
subcommand.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>public / restricted:
Set a package to be either publicly accessible or restricted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>add / rm:
Add or remove the ability of users and teams to have read-only or read-write
access to a package.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ls:
Show all of the access privileges for a package. Will only show permissions
for packages to which you have at least read access.</p>
</li>
<li><p>edit:
Set the access privileges for a package at once using <code>$EDITOR</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details">DETAILS</h2>
<p><code>npm access</code> always operates directly on the current registry, configurable
from the command line using <code>--registry=&lt;registry url&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Unscoped packages are <em>always public</em>.</p>
<p>Scoped packages <em>default to restricted</em>, but you can either publish them as
public using <code>npm publish --access=public</code>, or set their access as public using
<code>npm access public</code> after the initial publish.</p>
<p>You must have privileges to set the access of a package:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are an owner of an unscoped or scoped package.</li>
<li>You are a member of the team that owns a scope.</li>
<li>You have been given read-write privileges for a package, either as a member
of a team or directly as an owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your account is not paid, then attempts to publish scoped packages will fail
with an HTTP 402 status code (logically enough), unless you use
<code>--access=public</code>.</p>
