<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre><code>npm.commands.uninstall(packages, callback)
</code></pre><h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This acts much the same ways as uninstalling on the command-line.</p>
<p>The &#39;packages&#39; parameter is an array of strings. Each element in the array is
the name of a package to be uninstalled.</p>
<p>Finally, &#39;callback&#39; is a function that will be called when all packages have been
uninstalled or when an error has been encountered.</p>
