<h1><a href="../api/npm-edit.html">npm-edit</a></h1> <p>Edit an installed package</p>
<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre><code>npm.commands.edit(package, callback)
</code></pre><h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Opens the package folder in the default editor (or whatever you&#39;ve
configured as the npm <code>editor</code> config -- see <code>npm help config</code>.)</p>
<p>After it has been edited, the package is rebuilt so as to pick up any
changes in compiled packages.</p>
<p>For instance, you can do <code>npm install connect</code> to install connect
into your package, and then <code>npm.commands.edit([&quot;connect&quot;], callback)</code>
to make a few changes to your locally installed copy.</p>
<p>The first parameter is a string array with a single element, the package
to open. The package can optionally have a version number attached.</p>
<p>Since this command opens an editor in a new process, be careful about where
and how this is used.</p>
