<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre><code>npm.commands.cache([args], callback)

// helpers
npm.commands.cache.clean([args], callback)
npm.commands.cache.add([args], callback)
npm.commands.cache.read(name, version, forceBypass, callback)
</code></pre><h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This acts much the same ways as the <a href="../cli/npm-cache.html">npm-cache(1)</a> command line
functionality.</p>
<p>The callback is called with the package.json data of the thing that is
eventually added to or read from the cache.</p>
<p>The top level <code>npm.commands.cache(...)</code> functionality is a public
interface, and like all commands on the <code>npm.commands</code> object, it will
match the command line behavior exactly.</p>
<p>However, the cache folder structure and the cache helper functions are
considered <strong>internal</strong> API surface, and as such, may change in future
releases of npm, potentially without warning or significant version
incrementation.</p>
<p>Use at your own risk.</p>
