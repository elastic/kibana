# Source Code Pro

Source Code Pro is a set of OpenType fonts that have been designed to work well
in user interface (UI) environments. In addition to a functional OpenType font, this open
source project provides all of the source files that were used to build this OpenType font
by using the AFDKO makeotf tool.
