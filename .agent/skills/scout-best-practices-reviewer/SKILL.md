# Scout Best Practices Reviewer

## Overview

- Identify whether the spec is **UI** (`test`/`spaceTest`) or **API** (`apiTest`) and review against the relevant best practices.
- Keep feedback concise and actionable: focus on correctness, flake risk, and CI/runtime impact.
- Report findings ordered by severity and include the matching best-practice heading (from the reference) next to each finding.
