# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of

# This data is by no means authoritative; if you think you know better,
# go ahead and edit the file (and please send any changes to
# tz@iana.org for general use in the future).

# From Paul Eggert (2013-02-21):
#
# A good source for time zone historical data outside the U.S. is
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
#
# Gwillim Law writes that a good source
# for recent time zone data is the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.
#
# Except where otherwise noted, Shanks & Pottenger is the source for
# entries through 1990, and IATA SSIM is the source for entries afterwards.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# For data circa 1899, a common source is:
# Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94
# <http://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359>.
#
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).
#
# Previous editions of this database used WAT, CAT, SAT, and EAT
# for +0:00 through +3:00, respectively,
# but Mark R V Murray reports that
# `SAST' is the official abbreviation for +2:00 in the country of South Africa,
# `CAT' is commonly used for +2:00 in countries north of South Africa, and
# `WAT' is probably the best name for +1:00, as the common phrase for
# the area that includes Nigeria is ``West Africa''.
# He has heard of ``Western Sahara Time'' for +0:00 but can find no reference.
#
# To make things confusing, `WAT' seems to have been used for -1:00 long ago;
# I'd guess that this was because people needed _some_ name for -1:00,
# and at the time, far west Africa was the only major land area in -1:00.
# This usage is now obsolete, as the last use of -1:00 on the African
# mainland seems to have been 1976 in Western Sahara.
#
# To summarize, the following abbreviations seem to have some currency:
#	-1:00	WAT	West Africa Time (no longer used)
#	 0:00	GMT	Greenwich Mean Time
#	 2:00	CAT	Central Africa Time
#	 2:00	SAST	South Africa Standard Time
# and Murray suggests the following abbreviation:
#	 1:00	WAT	West Africa Time
# I realize that this leads to `WAT' being used for both -1:00 and 1:00
# for times before 1976, but this is the best I can think of
# until we get more information.
#
# I invented the following abbreviations; corrections are welcome!
#	 2:00	WAST	West Africa Summer Time
#	 2:30	BEAT	British East Africa Time (no longer used)
#	 2:45	BEAUT	British East Africa Unified Time (no longer used)
#	 3:00	CAST	Central Africa Summer Time (no longer used)
#	 3:00	SAST	South Africa Summer Time (no longer used)
#	 3:00	EAT	East Africa Time

# From Abdelrahman Hassan (2007-09-06):
# Due to the Hijri (lunar Islamic calendar) year being 11 days shorter
# than the year of the Gregorian calendar, Ramadan shifts earlier each
# year. This year it will be observed September 13 (September is quite
# hot in Egypt), and the idea is to make fasting easier for workers by
# shifting business hours one hour out of daytime heat. Consequently,
# unless discontinued, next DST may end Thursday 28 August 2008.
# From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
# For lack of better info, assume the new rule is last Thursday in August.

# Mauritius

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-06-25):
# Mauritius plans to observe DST from 2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31 on a trial
# basis....
# It seems that Mauritius observed daylight saving time from 1982-10-10 to
# 1983-03-20 as well, but that was not successful....
# http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/mauritius-daylight-saving-time.html

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-06-30):
# The www.timeanddate.com article cited by Steffen Thorsen notes that "A
# final decision has yet to be made on the times that daylight saving
# would begin and end on these dates." As a place holder, use midnight.

# From Paul Eggert (2008-06-30):
# Follow Thorsen on DST in 1982/1983, instead of Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-07-10):
# According to
# <a href="http://www.lexpress.mu/display_article.php?news_id=111216">

# </a>
# (in French), Mauritius will start and end their DST a few days earlier
# than previously announced (2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31).  The new start
# date is 2008-10-26 at 02:00 and the new end date is 2009-03-27 (no time
# given, but it is probably at either 2 or 3 wall clock time).
#
# A little strange though, since the article says that they moved the date
# to align itself with Europe and USA which also change time on that date,
# but that means they have not paid attention to what happened in
# USA/Canada last year (DST ends first Sunday in November). I also wonder
# why that they end on a Friday, instead of aligning with Europe which
# changes two days later.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-07-11):
# Seems that English language article "The revival of daylight saving
# time:  Energy conservation?"-# No. 16578 (07/11/2008) was originally
# published on Monday, June 30, 2008...
#
# I guess that article in French "Le gouvernement avance l'introduction
# de l'heure d'ete" stating that DST in Mauritius starting on October 26
# and ending on March 27, 2009 is the most recent one.

# last Sunday of October and will end at two o'clock in the morning on

# While the entire country changes its time, Katima Mulilo and other
# settlements in Caprivi unofficially will not because the sun there
# rises and sets earlier compared to other regions.  Chief of
# Forecasting Riaan van Zyl explained that the far eastern parts of
# the country are close to 40 minutes earlier in sunrise than the rest
# of the country.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2007-03-31):
# Apparently the Caprivi Strip informally observes Botswana time, but
# we have no details.  In the meantime people there can use Africa/Gaborone.

# Tunisia

# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-30):
# My correspondent, Risto Nykanen, has alerted me to another adoption of DST,
# this time in Tunisia.  According to Yahoo France News
# <http://fr.news.yahoo.com/050426/5/4dumk.html>, in a story attributed to AP
# and dated 2005-04-26, "Tunisia has decided to advance its official time by
# one hour, starting on Sunday, May 1.  Henceforth, Tunisian time will be
# UTC+2 instead of UTC+1.  The change will take place at 23:00 UTC next
# Saturday."  (My translation)
#
# From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-05-02):
# LaPresse, the first national daily newspaper ...
# <http://www.lapresse.tn/archives/archives280405/actualites/lheure.html>
# ... DST for 2005: on: Sun May 1 0h standard time, off: Fri Sept. 30,
# 1h standard time.
#
# From Atef Loukil (2006-03-28):
# The daylight saving time will be the same each year:
# Beginning      : the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# Ending         : the last Sunday of October at 03:00 ...
# http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1188&Itemid=50

# From Steffen Thorsen (2009-03-16):
# According to several news sources, Tunisia will not observe DST this year.

# </a>

# From Arthur David Olson (2009--3-18):
# The Tunis Afrique Presse News Agency notice contains this: "This measure is due to the fact
# that the fasting month of ramadan coincides with the period concerned by summer time.
# Therefore, the standard time will be kept unchanged the whole year long."
# So foregoing DST seems to be an exception (albeit one that may be repeated in the  future).

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2010-03-27):
# According to some news reports Tunis confirmed not to use DST in 2010
#
# (translation):
# "The Tunisian government has decided to abandon DST, which was scheduled on
# Sunday...
# Tunisian authorities had suspended the DST for the first time last year also
# coincided with the month of Ramadan..."
