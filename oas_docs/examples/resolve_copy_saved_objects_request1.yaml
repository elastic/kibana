summary: Resolve conflict errors
description: >
  Resolve conflict errors for a data view, visualization, and Canvas workpad by overwriting the existing saved objects.
  NOTE: If a prior copy attempt resulted in resolvable errors, you must include a retry for each object you want to copy, including any that were returned in the successResults array.
  In this example, we retried copying the dashboard accordingly.
