summary: Resolve missing reference errors
description: >
  Resolve missing reference errors for a visualization by ignoring the error.
  NOTE: If a prior copy attempt resulted in resolvable errors, you must include a retry for each object you want to copy, including any that were returned in the successResults array.
  In this example, we retried copying the dashboard and canvas accordingly.
