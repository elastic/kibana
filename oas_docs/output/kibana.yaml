  title: Kibana APIs
  description: >
    The Kibana REST APIs enable you to manage resources such as connectors, data
    views, and saved objects.

    The API calls are stateless.

    Each request that you make happens in isolation from other calls and must
    include all of the necessary information for Kibana to fulfill the

    request.

    API requests return JSON output, which is a format that is machine-readable
    and works well for automation.


    To interact with Kibana APIs, use the following operations:


    - GET: Fetches the information.

    - PATCH: Applies partial modifications to the existing information.

    - POST: Adds new information.

    - PUT: Updates the existing information.

    - DELETE: Removes the information.


    You can prepend any Kibana API endpoint with `kbn:` and run the request in
    **Dev Tools → Console**.

    For example:


    ```

    GET kbn:/api/data_views

    ```


    For more information about the console, refer to [Run API
    requests](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html).

      description: >
        To create a rule, you must have `all` privileges for the appropriate
        Kibana features, depending on the `consumer` and `rule_type_id` of the
        rule you're creating. For example, you must have privileges for the
        **Management > Stack rules** feature, **Analytics > Discover** and
        **Machine Learning** features, **Observability** features, or
        **Security** features. If the rule has actions, you must also have
        `read` privileges for the **Management > Actions and Connectors**
        feature. This API supports both key- and token-based authentication. To
        use key-based authentication, create an API key in Kibana and use it in
        the header of the API call. To use token-based authentication, provide a
        username and password; an API key that matches the current privileges of
        the user is created automatically. In both cases, the API key is
        subsequently used for authorization when the rule runs.

        Case settings include external connection details, custom fields, and
        templates.  Connectors are used to interface with external systems. You
        must create a connector before you can use it in your cases. If you set
        a default connector, it is automatically selected when you create cases
        in Kibana. If you use the create case API, however, you must still
        specify all of the connector details. You must have `all` privileges for
        the **Cases** feature in the **Management**, **Observability**, or
        **Security** section of the Kibana feature privileges, depending on
        where you are creating cases.

    patch:
      summary: Update case settings
      operationId: updateCaseConfigurationDefaultSpace
      description: >
        Updates setting details such as the closure type, custom fields,
        templates, and the default connector for cases. Connectors are used to
        interface with external systems. You must create a connector before you
        can use it in your cases. You must have `all` privileges for the
        **Cases** feature in the **Management**, **Observability**, or
        **Security** section of the Kibana feature privileges, depending on
        where the case was created.

        If a saved object cannot be decrypted using the primary encryption key,
        then Kibana will attempt to decrypt it using the specified
        decryption-only keys. In most of the cases this overhead is negligible,
        but if you're dealing with a large number of saved objects and
        experiencing performance issues, you may want to rotate the encryption
        key.


        This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed
        in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features
        in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA
        features.

            Specifies a maximum number of saved objects that Kibana can process

            objects in one go and splits processing into consequent batches. By
            default, the batch size is 10000, which is also a maximum allowed

        To resolve errors from the Import objects API, you can:


        * Retry certain saved objects

        * Overwrite specific saved objects

        * Change references to different saved objects


        This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed
        in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features
        in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA

                                Actions run when the alert status changes;
                                `onActiveAlert`: Actions run when the alert

                                    method is to set it for each action. If you

                    using the same correlation ID are associated with the same
                    ServiceNow incident. This value determines whether a new
                    ServiceNow incident is created or an existing one is
                    updated. Modifying this value is optional; if not modified,
                    the rule ID and alert ID are combined as `{{ruleID}}:{{alert
                    ID}}` to form the correlation ID value in ServiceNow. The
                    maximum character length for this value is 100 characters.
                    NOTE: Using the default configuration of `{{ruleID}}:{{alert
                    ID}}` ensures that ServiceNow creates a separate incident
                    record for every generated alert that uses a unique alert
                    ID. If the rule generates multiple alerts that use the same
                    alert IDs, ServiceNow creates and continually updates a
                    single incident record for the alert.
