    The Kibana REST APIs enable you to manage resources such as connectors, data views, and saved objects.
    The API calls are stateless.
    Each request that you make happens in isolation from other calls and must include all of the necessary information for Kibana to fulfill the
    request.
    API requests return JSON output, which is a format that is machine-readable and works well for automation.

    To interact with Kibana APIs, use the following operations:

    - GET: Fetches the information.
    - PATCH: Applies partial modifications to the existing information.
    - POST: Adds new information.
    - PUT: Updates the existing information.
    - DELETE: Removes the information.

    You can prepend any Kibana API endpoint with `kbn:` and run the request in **Dev Tools → Console**.
    For example:

    ```
    GET kbn:/api/data_views
    ```

    For more information about the console, refer to [Run API requests](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/query-filter/tools/console).

    NOTE: Access to internal Kibana API endpoints will be restricted in Kibana version 9.0. Please move any integrations to publicly documented APIs.

      Alerting enables you to define rules, which detect complex conditions within your data. When a condition is met, the rule tracks it as an alert and runs the actions that are defined in the rule. Actions typically involve the use of connectors to interact with Kibana services or third party integrations.

      Configure APM source maps. A source map allows minified files to be mapped back to original source code--allowing you to maintain the speed advantage of minified code, without losing the ability to quickly and easily debug your application.
      For best results, uploading source maps should become a part of your deployment procedure, and not something you only do when you see unhelpful errors. That's because uploading source maps after errors happen won't make old errors magically readable--errors must occur again for source mapping to occur.

      Use the detections APIs to create and manage detection rules. Detection rules search events and external alerts sent to Elastic Security and generate detection alerts from any hits. Alerts are displayed on the **Alerts** page and can be assigned and triaged, using the alert status to mark them as open, closed, or acknowledged.

      This API supports both key-based authentication and basic authentication.

      To use key-based authentication, create an API key, then specify the key in the header of your API calls.

      To use basic authentication, provide a username and password; this automatically creates an API key that matches the current user’s privileges.

      In both cases, the API key is subsequently used for authorization when the rule runs.
      > warn
      > If the API key used for authorization has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated a rule, the rule behavior might change.

      > If the API key that created a rule is deleted, or the user that created the rule becomes inactive, the rule will stop running.

      To create and run rules, the user must meet specific requirements for the Kibana space. Refer to the [Detections requirements](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/detections-permissions-section.html) for a complete list of requirements.

      Exceptions are associated with detection and endpoint rules, and are used to prevent a rule from generating an alert from incoming events, even when the rule's other criteria are met. They can help reduce the number of false positives and prevent trusted processes and network activity from generating unnecessary alerts.

      Exceptions are made up of:

      * **Exception containers**: A container for related exceptions. Generally, a single exception container contains all the exception items relevant for a subset of rules. For example, a container can be used to group together network-related exceptions that are relevant for a large number of network rules. The container can then be associated with all the relevant rules.
      * **Exception items**: The query (fields, values, and logic) used to prevent rules from generating alerts. When an exception item's query evaluates to `true`, the rule does not generate an alert.

      For detection rules, you can also use lists to define rule exceptions. A list holds multiple values of the same Elasticsearch data type, such as IP addresses. These values are used to determine when an exception prevents an alert from being generated.
      > info
      > You cannot use lists with endpoint rule exceptions.

      > info
      > Only exception containers can be associated with rules. You cannot directly associate an exception item or a list container with a rule. To use list exceptions, create an exception item that references the relevant list container.

      ## Exceptions requirements

      Before you can start working with exceptions that use value lists, you must create the `.lists` and `.items` data streams for the relevant Kibana space. To do this, use the [Create list data streams](../operation/operation-createlistindex) endpoint. Once these data streams are created, your role needs privileges to manage rules. For a complete list of requirements, refer to [Enable and access detections](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/detections-permissions-section.html#enable-detections-ui).
    name: Security Exceptions API
    x-displayName: Security exceptions
  - description: |
      Lists can be used with detection rule exceptions to define values that prevent a rule from generating alerts.

      Lists are made up of:

      * **List containers**: A container for values of the same Elasticsearch data type. The following data types can be used:
          * `boolean`
          * `byte`
          * `date`
          * `date_nanos`
          * `date_range`
          * `double`
          * `double_range`
          * `float`
          * `float_range`
          * `half_float`
          * `integer`
          * `integer_range`
          * `ip`
          * `ip_range`
          * `keyword`
          * `long`
          * `long_range`
          * `short`
          * `text`
      * **List items**: The values used to determine whether the exception prevents an alert from being generated.

      All list items in the same list container must be of the same data type, and each item defines a single value. For example, an IP list container named `internal-ip-addresses-southport` contains five items, where each item defines one internal IP address:
      1. `192.168.1.1`
      2. `192.168.1.3`
      3. `192.168.1.18`
      4. `192.168.1.12`
      5. `192.168.1.7`

      To use these IP addresses as values for defining rule exceptions, use the Security exceptions API to [create an exception list item](../operation/operation-createexceptionlistitem) that references the `internal-ip-addresses-southport` list.
      > info
      > Lists cannot be added directly to rules, nor do they define the operators used to determine when exceptions are applied (`is in list`, `is not in list`). Use an exception item to define the operator and associate it with an [exception container](../operation/operation-createexceptionlist). You can then add the exception container to a rule's `exceptions_list` object.

      ## Lists requirements

      Before you can start using lists, you must create the `.lists` and `.items` data streams for the relevant Kibana space. To do this, use the [Create list data streams](../operation/operation-createlistindex) endpoint. Once these data streams are created, your role needs privileges to manage rules. Refer to [Enable and access detections](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/detections-permissions-section.html#enable-detections-ui) for a complete list of requirements.

        Case settings include external connection details, custom fields, and templates. Connectors are used to interface with external systems. You must create a connector before you can use it in your cases. If you set a default connector, it is automatically selected when you create cases in Kibana. If you use the create case API, however, you must still specify all of the connector details. You must have `all` privileges for the **Cases** feature in the **Management**, **Observability**, or **Security** section of the Kibana feature privileges, depending on where you are creating cases.

        The difference between the `id` and `rule_id` is that the `id` is a unique rule identifier that is randomly generated when a rule is created and cannot be set, whereas `rule_id` is a stable rule identifier that can be assigned during rule creation.

        > When used with [API key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api-keys.html) authentication, the user's key gets assigned to the affected rules. If the user's key gets deleted or the user becomes inactive, the rules will stop running.

        > If the API key that is used for authorization has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated the rule, the rule behavior might change.

        > warn
        > When used with [API key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api-keys.html) authentication, the user's key gets assigned to the affected rules. If the user's key gets deleted or the user becomes inactive, the rules will stop running.

        > If the API key that is used for authorization has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated the rule, the rule behavior might change.

        You can create the following types of rules:

        * **Custom query**: Searches the defined indices and creates an alert when a document matches the rule's KQL query.
        * **Event correlation**: Searches the defined indices and creates an alert when results match an [Event Query Language (EQL)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/eql.html) query.
        * **Threshold**: Searches the defined indices and creates an alert when the number of times the specified field's value meets the threshold during a single execution. When there are multiple values that meet the threshold, an alert is generated for each value.
          For example, if the threshold `field` is `source.ip` and its `value` is `10`, an alert is generated for every source IP address that appears in at least 10 of the rule's search results. If you're interested, see [Terms Aggregation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html) for more information.
        * **Indicator match**: Creates an alert when fields match values defined in the specified [Elasticsearch index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html). For example, you can create an index for IP addresses and use this index to create an alert whenever an event's `destination.ip` equals a value in the index. The index's field mappings should be [ECS-compliant](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-reference.html).
        * **New terms**: Generates an alert for each new term detected in source documents within a specified time range.
        * **ES|QL**: Uses [Elasticsearch Query Language (ES|QL)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/esql.html) to find events and aggregate search results.
        * **Machine learning rules**: Creates an alert when a machine learning job discovers an anomaly above the defined threshold.
        > info
        > To create machine learning rules, you must have the [appropriate license](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) or use a [cloud deployment](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration). Additionally, for the machine learning rule to function correctly, the associated machine learning job must be running.

        To retrieve machine learning job IDs, which are required to create machine learning jobs, call the [Elasticsearch Get jobs API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ml-get-job.html). Machine learning jobs that contain `siem` in the `groups` field can be used to create rules:

        ```json
        ...
        "job_id": "linux_anomalous_network_activity_ecs",
        "job_type": "anomaly_detector",
        "job_version": "7.7.0",
        "groups": [
          "auditbeat",
          "process",
          "siem"
        ],
        ...
        ```

        Additionally, you can set up notifications for when rules create alerts. The notifications use the [Alerting and Actions framework](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/alerting-getting-started.html). Each action type requires a connector. Connectors store the information required to send notifications via external systems. The following connector types are supported for rule notifications:

        * Slack
        * Email
        * PagerDuty
        * Webhook
        * Microsoft Teams
        * IBM Resilient
        * Jira
        * ServiceNow ITSM
        > info
        > For more information on PagerDuty fields, see [Send a v2 Event](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/events-api-v2/trigger-events/).

        To retrieve connector IDs, which are required to configure rule notifications, call the [Find objects API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/saved-objects-api-find.html) with `"type": "action"` in the request payload.

        For detailed information on Kibana actions and alerting, and additional API calls, see:

        Update a detection rule using the `rule_id` or `id` field. The original rule is replaced, and all unspecified fields are deleted.

        The difference between the `id` and `rule_id` is that the `id` is a unique rule identifier that is randomly generated when a rule is created and cannot be set, whereas `rule_id` is a stable rule identifier that can be assigned during rule creation.
        > warn
        > When used with [API key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api-keys.html) authentication, the user's key gets assigned to the affected rules. If the user's key gets deleted or the user becomes inactive, the rules will stop running.

        > If the API key that is used for authorization has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated the rule, the rule behavior might change.

        Apply a bulk action, such as bulk edit, duplicate, or delete, to multiple detection rules. The bulk action is applied to all rules that match the query or to the rules listed by their IDs.

        The edit action allows you to add, delete, or set tags, index patterns, investigation fields, rule actions and schedules for multiple rules at once. 
        The edit action is idempotent, meaning that if you add a tag to a rule that already has that tag, no changes are made. The same is true for other edit actions, for example removing an index pattern that is not specified in a rule will not result in any changes. The only exception is the `add_rule_actions` and `set_rule_actions` action, which is non-idempotent. This means that if you add or set a rule action to a rule that already has that action, a new action is created with a new unique ID.
        > warn
        > When used with  [API key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api-keys.html) authentication, the user's key gets assigned to the affected rules. If the user's key gets deleted or the user becomes inactive, the rules will stop running.

        > If the API key that is used for authorization has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated the rule, the rule behavior might change.

            Enables dry run mode for the request call.

            Enable dry run mode to verify that bulk actions can be applied to specified rules. Certain rules, such as prebuilt Elastic rules on a Basic subscription, can’t be edited and will return errors in the request response. Error details will contain an explanation, the rule name and/or ID, and additional troubleshooting information.

            To enable dry run mode on a request, add the query parameter `dry_run=true` to the end of the request URL. Rules specified in the request will be temporarily updated. These updates won’t be written to Elasticsearch.
            > info
            > Dry run mode is not supported for the `export` bulk action. A 400 error will be returned in the request response.

        Import detection rules from an `.ndjson` file, including actions and exception lists. The request must include:
        - The `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` HTTP header.
        - A link to the `.ndjson` file containing the rules.
        > warn
        > When used with [API key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api-keys.html) authentication, the user's key gets assigned to the affected rules. If the user's key gets deleted or the user becomes inactive, the rules will stop running.

        > If the API key that is used for authorization has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated the rule, the rule behavior might change.
        > info
        > To import rules with actions, you need at least Read privileges for the Action and Connectors feature. To overwrite or add new connectors, you need All privileges for the Actions and Connectors feature. To import rules without actions, you don’t need Actions and Connectors privileges. Refer to [Enable and access detections](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/detections-permissions-section.html#enable-detections-ui) for more information.

        > info
        > Rule actions and connectors are included in the exported file, but sensitive information about the connector (such as authentication credentials) is not included. You must re-add missing connector details after importing detection rules.

        > You can use Kibana’s [Saved Objects](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/managing-saved-objects.html) UI (Stack Management → Kibana → Saved Objects) or the Saved Objects APIs (experimental) to [export](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/operation/operation-exportsavedobjectsdefault) and [import](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/operation/operation-importsavedobjectsdefault) any necessary connectors before importing detection rules.

        > Similarly, any value lists used for rule exceptions are not included in rule exports or imports. Use the [Manage value lists](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/value-lists-exceptions.html#manage-value-lists) UI (Rules → Detection rules (SIEM) → Manage value lists) to export and import value lists separately.

        Migrations favor data integrity over shard size. Consequently, unused or orphaned indices are artifacts of
        the migration process. A successful migration will result in both the old and new indices being present.
        As such, the old, orphaned index can (and likely should) be deleted.

        While you can delete these indices manually,
        the endpoint accomplishes this task by applying a deletion policy to the relevant index, causing it to be deleted
        after 30 days. It also deletes other artifacts specific to the migration implementation.

        Superuser role required.

        If a saved object cannot be decrypted using the primary encryption key, then Kibana will attempt to decrypt it using the specified decryption-only keys. In most of the cases this overhead is negligible, but if you're dealing with a large number of saved objects and experiencing performance issues, you may want to rotate the encryption key.

        This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

      parameters:
        - description: |
            Specifies a maximum number of saved objects that Kibana can process in a single batch. Bulk key rotation is an iterative process since Kibana may not be able to fetch and process all required saved objects in one go and splits processing into consequent batches. By default, the batch size is 10000, which is also a maximum allowed value.

        An exception list groups exception items and can be associated with detection rules. You can assign exception lists to multiple detection rules.
        > info
        > All exception items added to the same list are evaluated using `OR` logic. That is, if any of the items in a list evaluate to `true`, the exception prevents the rule from generating an alert. Likewise, `OR` logic is used for evaluating exceptions when more than one exception list is assigned to a rule. To use the `AND` operator, you can define multiple clauses (`entries`) in a single exception item.

        An exception list groups exception items and can be associated with detection rules. A shared exception list can apply to multiple detection rules.
        > info
        > All exception items added to the same list are evaluated using `OR` logic. That is, if any of the items in a list evaluate to `true`, the exception prevents the rule from generating an alert. Likewise, `OR` logic is used for evaluating exceptions when more than one exception list is assigned to a rule. To use the `AND` operator, you can define multiple clauses (`entries`) in a single exception item.

            When true, force delete objects that exist in multiple namespaces. Note that the option applies to the whole request. Use the delete object API to specify per-object deletion behavior. TIP: Use this if you attempted to delete objects and received an HTTP 400 error with the following message: "Unable to delete saved object that exists in multiple namespaces, use the force option to delete it anyway". WARNING: When you bulk delete objects that exist in multiple namespaces, the API also deletes legacy url aliases that reference the object. These requests are batched to minimise the impact but they can place a heavy load on Kibana. Make sure you limit the number of objects that exist in multiple namespaces in a single bulk delete operation.

When an object's ID is regenerated, a legacy URL alias is created for that object, preserving its old ID. In such a scenario, that object can be retrieved by the bulk resolve API using either its new ID or its old ID.

The field format is similar to filter, meaning that to use a saved object type attribute in the aggregation, the `savedObjectType.attributes.title: "myTitle"` format must be used. For root fields, the syntax is `savedObjectType.rootField`. NOTE: As objects change in Kibana, the results on each page of the response also change. Use the find API for traditional paginated results, but avoid using it to export large amounts of data.

You can use an array of strings to add multiple alerts to a case, provided that they all relate to the same rule; `index` must also be an array with the same length or number of elements. Adding multiple alerts in this manner is recommended rather than calling the API multiple times. This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release.

    Security_Detections_API_RelatedIntegration:
      description: |
        Related integration is a potential dependency of a rule. It's assumed that if the user installs
        one of the related integrations of a rule, the rule might start to work properly because it will
        have source events (generated by this integration) potentially matching the rule's query.

        NOTE: Proper work is not guaranteed, because a related integration, if installed, can be
        configured differently or generate data that is not necessarily relevant for this rule.

        Related integration is a combination of a Fleet package and (optionally) one of the
        package's "integrations" that this package contains. It is represented by 3 properties:

        - `package`: name of the package (required, unique id)
        - `version`: version of the package (required, semver-compatible)
        - `integration`: name of the integration of this package (optional, id within the package)

        There are Fleet packages like `windows` that contain only one integration; in this case,
        `integration` should be unspecified. There are also packages like `aws` and `azure` that contain
        several integrations; in this case, `integration` should be specified.
      example:
        integration: activitylogs
        package: azure
        version: ~1.1.6
      type: object
      properties:

    Security_Detections_API_RequiredField:
      description: |
        Describes an Elasticsearch field that is needed for the rule to function.

        Almost all types of Security rules check source event documents for a match to some kind of
        query or filter. If a document has certain field with certain values, then it's a match and
        the rule will generate an alert.

        Required field is an event field that must be present in the source indices of a given rule.

        @example
        const standardEcsField: RequiredField = {
          name: 'event.action',
          type: 'keyword',
          ecs: true,
        };

        @example
        const nonEcsField: RequiredField = {
          name: 'winlog.event_data.AttributeLDAPDisplayName',
          type: 'keyword',
          ecs: false,
        };
      type: object
      properties:
        ecs:
          description: Indicates whether the field is ECS-compliant. This property is only present in responses. Its value is computed based on field’s name and type.

        - going to run - @deprecated Replaced by the 'running' status but left for backwards compatibility with rule execution events already written to Event Log in the prior versions of Kibana. Don't use when writing rule status changes.
        - running - Rule execution started but not reached any intermediate or final status.
        - partial failure - Rule can partially fail for various reasons either in the middle of an execution (in this case we update its status right away) or in the end of it. So currently this status can be both intermediate and final at the same time. A typical reason for a partial failure: not all the indices that the rule searches over actually exist.
        - failed - Rule failed to execute due to unhandled exception or a reason defined in the business logic of its executor function.
        - succeeded - Rule executed successfully without any issues. Note: this status is just an indication of a rule's "health". The rule might or might not generate any alerts despite of it.

        You can use Boolean and and or logic to define the conditions for when matching fields and values generate alerts. Sibling entries objects are evaluated using or logic, whereas multiple entries in a single entries object use and logic. See Example of Threat Match rule which uses both `and` and `or` logic.

            Monitors can be deployed in multiple locations so that you can detect differences in availability and response times across those locations.
            To list available locations you can:

            - Run the `elastic-synthetics locations` command with the deployment's Kibana URL.
            - Go to *Synthetics > Management* and click *Create monitor*. Locations will be listed in *Locations*.

            To list available private locations you can:

            - Run the `elastic-synthetics locations` command with the deployment's Kibana URL.
            - Go to *Synthetics > Settings* and click *Private locationsr*. Private locations will be listed in the table.

                    The correlation identifier for the security incident for ServiceNow ITSM and ServiveNow SecOps connectors. Connectors using the same correlation ID are associated with the same ServiceNow incident. This value determines whether a new ServiceNow incident is created or an existing one is updated. Modifying this value is optional; if not modified, the rule ID and alert ID are combined as `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` to form the correlation ID value in ServiceNow. The maximum character length for this value is 100 characters. NOTE: Using the default configuration of `{{ruleID}}:{{alert ID}}` ensures that ServiceNow creates a separate incident record for every generated alert that uses a unique alert ID. If the rule generates multiple alerts that use the same alert IDs, ServiceNow creates and continually updates a single incident record for the alert.

  - title: Kibana spaces
    content: |
      Spaces enable you to organize your dashboards and other saved objects into meaningful categories.
      You can use the default space or create your own spaces.

      To run APIs in non-default spaces, you must add `s/{space_id}/` to the path.
      For example:

      ```
      curl -X GET "http://localhost:5601/s/marketing/api/data_views"
      ```

      If you use the Kibana console to send API requests, it automatically adds the appropriate space identifier.

      To learn more, check out [Spaces](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/manage-spaces).
