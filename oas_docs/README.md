# Kibana API reference documentation

Documentation about our OpenAPI bundling workflow and configuration. See Kibana's hosted [stateful](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana) and [serverless](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/serverless) docs.

## Workflow

The final goal of this workflow is to produce an OpenAPI bundle containing all Kibana's public APIs.

### Step 0

OAS from Kibana's APIs are continuously extracted and captured in `bundle.json` and `bundle.serverless.json` as fully formed OAS documentation. See `node scripts/capture_oas_snapshot --help` for more info.

These bundles form the basis of our OpenAPI bundles to which we append and layer extra information before publishing.

### Step 1

Append pre-existing bundles not extracted from code using [`kbn-openapi-bundler`](../packages/kbn-openapi-bundler/README.md) to produce the final resulting bundles.

To add more files into the final bundle, edit the appropriate `oas_docs/scripts/merge*.js` files.

### Step 2

Apply any final overalys to the document that might include examples or final tweaks (see the ["Scripts"](#scripts) section for more details).

## Scripts

The `oas_docs/scripts` folder contains scripts that point to the source domain-specific OpenAPI bundles and specify additional parameters for producing the final output bundle. Currently, there are the following scripts:

- `merge_ess_oas.js` script produces production an output bundle for ESS

- `merge_serverless_oas.js` script produces production an output bundle for Serverless

### Output Kibana OpenAPI bundles

The `oas_docs/output` folder contains the final resulting Kibana OpenAPI bundles

- `kibana.yaml` production ready ESS OpenAPI bundle
- `kibana.serverless.yaml` production ready Serverless OpenAPI bundle

## Bundling commands

Besides the scripts in the `oas_docs/scripts` folder, there is an `oas_docs/makefile` to simplify the workflow. The following makefile targets are available:
