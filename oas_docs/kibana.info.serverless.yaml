  title: Kibana Serverless APIs
  description: |
    The Kibana REST APIs for Elastic serverless enable you to manage resources
    such as connectors, data views, and saved objects. The API calls are
    stateless. Each request that you make happens in isolation from other calls
    and must include all of the necessary information for Kibana to fulfill the
    request. API requests return JSON output, which is a format that is
    machine-readable and works well for automation.
    
    To interact with Kibana APIs, use the following operations:
    
    - GET: Fetches the information.
    - POST: Adds new information.
    - PUT: Updates the existing information.
    - DELETE: Removes the information.
    
    You can prepend any Kibana API endpoint with `kbn:` and run the request in
    **Dev Tools â†’ Console**. For example:

    ```
    GET kbn:/api/data_views
    ```
