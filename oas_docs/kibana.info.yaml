  description: |
    The Kibana REST APIs enable you to manage resources such as connectors, data views, and saved objects.
    The API calls are stateless.
    Each request that you make happens in isolation from other calls and must include all of the necessary information for Kibana to fulfill the
    request.
    API requests return JSON output, which is a format that is machine-readable and works well for automation.
    
    To interact with Kibana APIs, use the following operations:
    
    - GET: Fetches the information.
    - PATCH: Applies partial modifications to the existing information.
    - POST: Adds new information.
    - PUT: Updates the existing information.
    - DELETE: Removes the information.
    
    You can prepend any Kibana API endpoint with `kbn:` and run the request in **Dev Tools → Console**.
    For example:

    ```
    GET kbn:/api/data_views
    ```

    For more information about the console, refer to [Run API requests](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html).
