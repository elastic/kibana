        You can schedule single or recurring maintenance windows to temporarily reduce rule notifications.
        For example, a maintenance window prevents false alarms during planned outages.

    description: Change tag description and displayName
    update:
      description: >
        Alerting enables you to define rules, which detect complex conditions within your data.
        When a condition is met, the rule tracks it as an alert and runs the actions that are defined in the rule.
        Actions typically involve the use of connectors to interact with Kibana services or third party integrations.
