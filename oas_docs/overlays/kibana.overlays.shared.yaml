        You can schedule single or recurring maintenance windows to temporarily reduce rule notifications.
        For example, a maintenance window prevents false alarms during planned outages.

    update:
      description: >
        Alerting enables you to define rules, which detect complex conditions within your data.
        When a condition is met, the rule tracks it as an alert and runs the actions that are defined in the rule.
        Actions typically involve the use of connectors to interact with Kibana services or third party integrations.

        Cases are used to open and track issues.
        You can add assignees and tags to your cases, set their severity and status, and add alerts, comments, and visualizations.
        You can also send cases to external incident management systems by configuring connectors.

        Connectors provide a central place to store connection information for services and integrations with Elastic or third party systems.
        Alerting rules can use connectors to run actions when rule conditions are met.
