            Spaces enable you to organize your dashboards and other saved objects into meaningful categories.
            You can use the default space or create your own spaces.

            To run APIs in non-default spaces, you must add `s/{space_id}/` to the path.
            For example:

            ```
            curl -X GET "http://localhost:5601/s/marketing/api/data_views"
            ```

            If you use the Kibana console to send API requests, it automatically adds the appropriate space identifier.

            To learn more, check out [Spaces](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-spaces.html).

    update:
      description: >
        Alerting enables you to define rules, which detect complex conditions within your data.
        When a condition is met, the rule tracks it as an alert and runs the actions that are defined in the rule. 
        Actions typically involve the use of connectors to interact with Kibana services or third party integrations.

        Cases are used to open and track issues.
        You can add assignees and tags to your cases, set their severity and status, and add alerts, comments, and visualizations.
        You can also send cases to external incident management systems by configuring connectors.

        Connectors provide a central place to store connection information for services and integrations with Elastic or third party systems.
        Alerting rules can use connectors to run actions when rule conditions are met.
