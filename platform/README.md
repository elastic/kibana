# New platform

## Dev setup

Make sure you're running the Node version specified in `../.node-version`.

If you've upgraded your npm version, you might need to delete your `node_modules`
folder and re-run `npm install`.

## Running code

To get this stuff running locally (as we don't have a proper build system yet):

From a clean setup locally (the best is probably to just `rm` your
`node_modules`), run:

```sh
cd packages/kbn-internal-native-observable
npm install
cd -

cd packages/kbn-observable
npm install
cd -

#  from root directory
npm install

cd packages/kbn-types
npm install
cd -

# from root directory
npm run ts:build
```

(Yeah, this is horrible â€” yeah, this is something I'm currently working on fixing properly)

If you get into a weird state you might clean the `target` directories,
`find . -name "target"`, or the `node_modules` directories.

When this completes you can start the server and plugins as a standalone Node application:

```bash
node scripts/platform.js
```

Or load it as a part of the legacy platform:

```bash
npm start
```

In the latter case, all Kibana requests will hit the new platform first and it will decide whether request can be
solely handled by the new platform or request should be forwarded to the legacy platform. In this mode new platform does
not read config file directly, but rather transforms config provided by the legacy platform. In addition to that all log
records are forwarded to the legacy platform so that it can layout and output them properly.

## Running tests

Run Jest:

```
node scripts/jest.js
```

(add `--watch` for re-running on change)

## VSCode

If you want to see what it looks like with fantastic editor support.

```
$ cat ~/.vscode/settings.json
// Place your settings in this file to overwrite default and user settings.
{
  "typescript.tsdk": "./node_modules/typescript/lib",
  "typescript.referencesCodeLens.enabled": true
}
```

## Starting plugins in the new platform

Plugins in `../core_plugins` will be started automatically. In addition, dirs to
scan for plugins can be specified in the Kibana config by setting the
`__newPlatform.plugins.scanDirs` value, e.g.

```yaml
__newPlatform:
  plugins:
    scanDirs: ['./example_plugins']
```
