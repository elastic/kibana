`@kbn/pm` is the tool that we use to bootstrap the Kibana repository, build packages with Bazel, and run scripts in packages.

## commands

### `yarn kbn bootstrap`

Use this command to install dependencies, build packages, and prepare the repo for local development.

### `yarn kbn watch`

Use this command to build all packages and make sure that they are rebuilt as you make changes.

### and more!

There are several commands supported by `@kbn/pm`, but rather than documenting them here they are documented in the help text. Please run `yarn kbn --help` locally to see the most up-to-date info.

## Why isn't this TypeScript?

Since this tool is required for bootstrapping the repository it needs to work without any dependencies installed and without a build toolchain. We accomplish this by writing the tool in vanilla JS (shocker!) and using TypeScript to validate the code which is typed via heavy use of JSDoc comments.

In order to use import/export syntax and enhance the developer experience a little we use the `.mjs` file extension.
